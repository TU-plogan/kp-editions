                <p>IT is our principal object in this article to lay before our readers a view of
                    the present state of British agriculture, particularly as the art is practised
                    in our best cultivated counties. Much of what we shall state is derived from our
                    own experience and observation; but we shall nevertheless be careful, on all
                    matters of importance, to refer to the most approved authorities.</p>
                <p>It is sufficiently evident that the culture of the soil must have somewhat
                    preceded, and always kept pace with, the increase of population. When we read of
                    the large armies brought into the field in the early ages, and the great number
                    of inhabitants which some of the ancient cities are said to have contained, we
                    must necessarily conclude that the labours of agriculture were conducted with
                    skill, and that its produce was abundant. A considerable population may, no
                    doubt, subsist upon a rich soil, even in a very rude state of the art, drawing
                    from it only the supply of their own wants; but if much of the cultivator’s tune
                    be required in the service of the public, and still more, if he has to provide
                    for the subsistence and the luxury of large cities, he can obtain the necessary
                    surplus produce only by successive improvements in his art. Not only his gross
                    produce, but his net disposable produce, must be proportionally increased.</p>
                <p>But of the rural economy even of the most civilized nations of antiquity, we are
                    almost wholly ignorant. From the age of Moses, almost down to the commencement
                    of the Christian era, though something may be gleaned from incidental notices in
                    the Scriptures, and in the writings of a few ancient authors, we are quite
                    unacquainted with the means by which food was obtained from the soil to support
                    the rapid increase of mankind; especially when we find it accumulated on spots
                    which seem to have been always naturally unproductive. We ought, perhaps, to
                    except the Works and Days of Hesiod, who lived in the tenth century before our
                    era, and who has described at some length the labours and the products of the
                    agriculture of Greece at that early period. His work contains almost all the
                    information we possess respecting the rural economy of that celebrated
                    people.</p>
                <p>Among the Romans this art seems to have obtained a high degree of improvement. It
                    was practised by the rich and the great, and described by their poets and
                    historians, several of whose works have reached our own times. These must be
                    familiar to the classical scholar, and have been rendered accessible to all by
                    Dickson, in his <hi rend="italic">Husbandry of the Ancients,</hi> and other
                    writers. We need therefore only mention the names ðf Cato, Varro, Virgil,
                    Columella, Pliny, and Palladius, in the order in which they wrote. The treatises
                    <hi rend="italic">De Re</hi><hi rend="italic">Rustica</hi> of Varro and
                    Columella are the most complete; but none of the Roman writers enables us to
                    trace the rise and progress of agriculture, either in Italy or in any other
                    country under their dominion. The most useful lesson they convey to the present
                    age, perhaps, is the importance of attending to minute details, which their
                    greatest names did not consider beneath their notice in the best period of their
                    history.</p>
                <p>From the fall of the Roman empire till the revival of learning in the fifteenth
                    century, little is known of the state of agriculture in any part of Europe. The
                    historians of the period were too much occupied in recording military
                    achievements, and with the rude policy and intestine broils of their respective
                    countries, to give much attention to the peaceful, and at that time degraded,
                    labours of the husbandman. The policy of the feudal system, the distribution of
                    society which it occasioned, and the perpetual dissensions and petty hostilities
                    which it engendered, furnish the best evidence of the low state of an art which
                    can flourish only under the protection of law, and be carried on with success
                    only by the energy of free <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033085"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3085-0252"/>men. But, during this long interval, the
                    population of Europe was divided into two great classes, of which by far the
                    larger one was composed of bondmen, without property, or the power of acquiring
                    it, and small tenants, very little superior to bondmen; and the other class,
                    consisting chiefly of the great barons and their retainers, was more frequently
                    employed in laying waste the fields of their rivals, than in improving their
                    own. The superstition of the times, which destined a large portion of the
                    country to the support of the church, and which, in some measure, secured it
                    from predatory incursions, was the principal source of what little skill and
                    industry were then displayed in the cultivation of the soil. “If we consider the
                    ancient state of Europe,” says Mr Hume,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>History of England, chap, xxiii.</p></note> “we shall find,
                    that the far greater part of society were everywhere bereaved of their personal
                    liberty, and lived entirely at the will of their masters. Every one that was not
                    noble was a slave; the peasants were not in a better condition; even the gentry
                    themselves were subjected to a long train of subordination under the greater
                    barons, or chief vassals of the crown, who, though seemingly placed in a high
                    state of splendour, yet, having but a slender protection from law, were exposed
                    to every tempest of the state, and, by the precarious condition on which they
                    lived, paid dearly for the power of oppressing and tyrannizing over their
                    inferiors.”—“The villains were entirely occupied in the cultivation of their
                    master’s land, and paid their rents either in corn or cattle, and other produce
                    of the farm, or in servile offices, which they performed about the baron’s
                    family, and upon farms which he retained in his own possession. In proportion as
                    agriculture improved and money increased, it was found that these services,
                    though extremely burdensome to the villain, were of little advantage to the
                    master; and that the produce of a large estate could be much more conveniently
                    disposed of by the peasants themselves, who raised it, than by the landlord or
                    his bailiff, who were formerly accustomed to receive it A commutation was
                    therefore made of rents for services, and of money-rents for those in kind; and
                    as men in a subsequent age discovered that farms were better cultivated where
                    the farmer enjoyed security in his possession, the practice of granting leases
                    to the peasant began to prevail, which entirely broke the bonds of servitude,
                    already much relaxed from the former practices. The latest laws which we find in
                    England for enforcing or regulating this species of servitude were enacted in
                    the reign of Henry VII. And though the ancient statutes on this subject remain
                    still unrepealed by Parliament, it appears, that before the end of Elizabeth,
                    the distinction between villain and freeman was totally, though insensibly,
                    abolished; and that no person remained in the state to whom the former laws
                    could be applied.”</p>
                <p>But, long before the fifteenth century, it is certain that there was a class of
                    tenants holding on leases for lives, or for a term of years, and paying a rent
                    in land produce, in services, or in money. Whether they gradually sprung up from
                    the class of bondmen, according to Lord Kames,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Karnes’s Law Tracts.</p></note> or existed
                    from the earliest period of the feudal constitution, according to other
                    writers,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bell’s Treatise
                    on Leases.</p></note> their number cannot be supposed to have been considerable
                    during the middle ages. The stock which these tenants employed in cultivation
                    commonly belonged to the proprietor, who received a proportion of the produce as
                    rent; a system which still exists in France and in other parts of the Continent,
                    where such tenants are called <hi rend="italic">metayers,</hi> and some vestiges
                    of which may yet be traced in the <hi rend="italic">steel-bow</hi> of the law of
                    Scotland. Leases of the thirteenth century still remain;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir John Cullum’s History and Antiquities of
                    Harested (Suffolk.)</p></note> and both the laws and chartularies<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Chalmers’s Caledonia, book
                    iv∙ c. G.</p></note> clearly prove the existence in Scotland of a class of
                    cultivators distinct from the <hi rend="italic">serfs</hi> or bondmen. Yet the
                    condition of these tenants seems to have been very different from that of the
                    tenants of the present day; and the lease approached nearer in its form to a feu
                    charter than to the mutual agreement now in use. It was of the nature of a
                    beneficiary grant by the proprietor, under certain conditions, and for a limited
                    period: the cousent of the tenant seems never to have been doubted. In the
                    common expression, “granting a lease,” we have retained an idea of the original
                    character of the deed, even to the present time.</p>
                <p>The corn crops cultivated during this period seem to have been of the same
                    species, though all of them probably much inferior in quality to what they are
                    in the present day. Wheat, the most valuable grain, must have borne a small
                    proportion, at least in Britain, to that of other crops; the remarkable
                    fluctuation of price, its extreme scarcity, indicated by the extravagant rate at
                    which it was sometimes sold, as well as the preparatory cultivation required,
                    may convince us that its consumption was confined to the higher orders, and that
                    its growth was by no means extensive. Rye and oats furnished the bread and drink
                    of the great body of the people of Europe. Cultivated herbage and roots were
                    then unknown in the agriculture of Britain. It was not till the end of the reign
                    of Henry VIII. that any sallads, carrots, or other edible roots were produced in
                    England. The little of these vegetables that was used, was formerly imported
                    from Holland and Flanders. Queen Catharine, when she wanted a sallad, was
                    obliged to dispatch a messenger thither on purpose.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hume’s History of England, chap,
                    xxiii.</p></note></p>
                <p>The ignorance and insecurity of those ages, which necessarily confined the
                    cultivation of corn to a comparatively small portion of country, left all the
                    rest of it in a state of nature, to be depastured by the inferior animals, then
                    only occasionally subjected to the care and control of man. Cultivators were
                    crowded together in miserable hamlets; the ground contiguous was kept
                    continually under tillage; and beyond this, wastes and woodlands of a much
                    greater extent were appropriated to the maintenance of their flocks and herds,
                    which pastured indiscriminately, with little attention from their owners.</p>
                <p>The low price of butcher-meat, though it was then the food of the common people,
                    when compared with the price of corn, has been justly noticed by several writers
                    as a decisive proof of the small progress of civilisation and industry.</p>
                <p>According to the reports of a writer who has had access to the best sources of
                    information, in addition to his own observations, the present state of the
                    agriculture of the greater part of the Continent of Europe is not very different
                    from what it was in Britain during the prevalence of the feudal system. “The
                    greater part of France,” he says, “a still much greater portion of Germany, and
                    nearly the whole of Prussia, Austria, Poland, and Russia, present a wretched
                    uniformity of system. It is called the three-course husbandry, consisting of,
                    Hi, one year’s clean fellow; 2cf, winter corn, chiefly rye, with a proportion of
                    wheat commensurate to the manure that can be applied; 3(Z, summer corn, or
                    barley and oats. There are occasional and small deviations from this system. In
                    some few cases potatoes, in others peas, are grown, in the fallow year; <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193033098" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3098-0253"/> but they are only
                    minute exceptions to the generally established system. It is not surprising that
                    under such a system the produce should not be much more than four times the
                    quantity of seed, at which rate it is calculated, as appears to be rightly, by
                    Baron Alexander Humboldt.”</p>
                <p>« The fields are almost universally uninclosed, and exposed to the most injurious
                    effects of a changeable and an intemperate climate. The ancient feudal system of
                    tenure is still continued, modified indeed, and softened in some few parts, but
                    not to a degree or an extent that deserves to be taken into account in the view
                    now under consideration of the countries as a whole. The peasants, for the most
                    part, are <hi rend="italic">adstricti glebae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    where, by recent laws, their condition has been changed, the practical effect
                    has yet hardly had time to exhibit any observable improvement in their state.
                    Labour, whether of men or of cattle, is usually exchanged for the occupancy of
                    land; and hence the labour is performed in the most negligent and imperfect
                    manner, that the vigilance of an overseer, who cannot be everywhere present,
                    will allow.</p>
                <p>“The lords of the soil, besides their demesnes, have the right of pasturage on
                    the fields of their tenants from harvest to the next seed-time: hence none of
                    those intervening crops which tend to enrich the soil can be cultivated without
                    infringing on their rights.</p>
                <p>“Among the cultivators of the land little or no accumulation of capital has been
                    formed; from the lord to the lowest grade of the peasantry, all are alike
                    destitute of disposable funds. The lords are only rich in land, and sufficiently
                    at their ease, if that land be unencumbered with mortgages or annuities. The
                    peasants, whether owners of the live stock and of the implements, or having the
                    use of them with the land from its owners, are content to live on, from year to
                    year, eating their own produce, growing their own wool and flax, and converting
                    them into garments. They are quite satisfied if they can dispose of as much
                    surplus produce as will pay the small share of money rent which becomes due to
                    their lord.” <hi rend="italic">(Tracts relating to the Corn Trade and Corn
                    Laws,</hi> by William Jacob, Esq. 1828.)</p>
                <p>It is certain, however, that an improved system has been introduced, and is
                    extending itself, though slowly, in many parts of the countries which this
                    writer has mentioned. Public establishments have been formed, which afford
                    examples of correct management; and by these means knowledge is diffused among
                    the principal land-owners in the first instance, and must ere long descend to
                    the cultivator. Since the peace, many of the former class have visited other
                    countries, and particularly Great Britain, with a view to the improvement of
                    their estates. Some of them have held out encouragement to settlers from this
                    country; others carried back our best implements, with farmbailiffs capable of
                    instructing their people in the use of them, and of introducing our system of
                    management generally; and not a few individuals of rank and influence in most
                    parts of the Continent of Europe are now well acquainted with our agriculture,
                    by their own personal observation. Prompted by interest, their active minds, no
                    longer occupied in war, seem to enter eagerly upon this new field of employment.
                    It is evident, indeed, from the great increase which has taken place of late in
                    the population of these countries, as well as of our own, that a corresponding
                    increase of produce must now be drawn from the soil. In all old peopled
                    countries, the extension of tillage to fresh lands, without any improvement in
                    the management, presents only a temporary and very limited resource.</p>
                <p>At present, however, we have certainly little to learn from the agriculture of
                    other countries; at least very little that can be beneficially introduced into
                    our climate, which forbids any attempt at cultivating the fruits of the south of
                    Europe. Even on a similar soil, and in the same latitude, the labours of the
                    husbandman must be to a considerable extent directed and controlled by the local
                    circumstances in which he is placed. This, perhaps, is the principal reason why
                    the old system of successive crops of corn still prevails so generally
                    throughout the Continent. The demand for butcher-meat, for instance, may not be
                    such as to afford a suitable return for the extended culture of turnips and
                    other ameliorating crops, which are found so beneficial in this country.</p>
                <p>We should except from this remark much of the Netherlands, and probably a part of
                    Italy. Flanders has long been celebrated for its agriculture; and tlíe care and
                    success with which its labours are conducted seem not unworthy the attention of
                    our best cultivators. The culture of the Vale of Arno, in Italy, also presents
                    an interesting object, and has been warmly eulogized by Chateauvieux and other
                    travellers. But instead of going into details here, we shall notice, under the
                    heads to which they belong, the practices that appear to us of most importance
                    in the agriculture of other countries, when we come to describe our own.</p>
                <p>Before entering upon this our main object, it may not be without its interest to
                    present a concise view of the progress of our agriculture to its present state,
                    from the rude condition in which, in common with that of the rest of Europe, it
                    was found at the time when we first have authorities to refer to on the subject.
                    Such a view must necessarily include notices of the principal laws affecting it,
                    as well as of our early writers, whose works are very little known; and it may
                    serve to convey some idea of the successive changes that have occurred in the
                    condition of the great body of our people.</p>
                <p>The subject of this article will thus be considered under two divisions. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> we shall treat of the history of British
                    agriculture; and in the <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> of its present state;
                    describing under the latter the crops, culture, and general management adapted
                    to different soils, agreeably to the practice of our best cultivators.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Part</hi> I.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History of British Agriculture.</hi></p>
                <p>Of the early agriculture of England, and of the condition of its cultivators, we
                    may form some conception by adverting to a few of the enactments, from the
                    Conquest down to the beginning of the reign of Henry VII. in 1485, when the
                    feudal system, which had been gradually falling into decay, was almost dissolved
                    in that country.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest and greatest grievances was the levying of Purveyance. This
                    originally comprehended the necessary provisions, carriages, &amp;c. which the
                    nearest farmers were obliged to furnish to the king’s armies at the current
                    prices, and to his houses and castles in time of war. It was called the <hi
                    rend="italic">great purveyance,</hi> and the officers who collected those
                    necessaries were called purveyors. The smaller purveyance included the necessary
                    provisions and carriages for the king’s household, when living at home, or
                    travelling through the kingdom, which the tenants on the king’s demesne lands
                    were obliged to furnish gratis; and the practice came to be adopted by the
                    barons and great men, in every tour which they thought proper to make in the
                    country. These exactions were so grievous, and levied in so licentious a manner,
                    that the farmers, when they heard of the court’s approach, often deserted their
                    houses, as if the country had been invaded <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033111"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3111-0254"/>by an enemy. “Purveyance,” says Dirom,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Inquiry into the Corn Laics,
                    &amp;c. p. 9.</p></note> “was perhaps for many centuries the chief obstruction
                    to the agriculture and improvement of Great Britain. Many laws were made for the
                    reformation and regulation of purveyance, but without effect; and the practice
                    continued down to so late a period as the reign of James the First.”</p>
                <p>The home trade in corn was restrained by acts against forestallers in 1360, and
                    at several subsequent periods. For many years after the Conquest, the greater
                    part of the trade of England was carried on in markets and fairs; and a very
                    considerable part of the revenue of the crown arose from the duties payable to
                    the king, upon the goods brought to them for sale. The barons had also tolls at
                    the fairs within their respective jurisdictions. When farmers and merchants were
                    bringing their corn and other necessaries to be sold there, they were sometimes
                    met on the way by persons who purchased their commodities, in order to retail
                    them at a higher price. Thus the king and the lords of the manor lost the
                    several duties payable to them; and the price, it was thought, was at the same
                    time raised to the inhabitants. Such were the original forestallcrs, who were
                    subjected by several statutes to severe penalties. This crime of forestalling,
                    and the kindred ones of regrating and engrossing, were carefully defined, and
                    the different degrees of punishment specified, in a new statuto in 1552, to be
                    afterwards noticed. An early law of 1266, for regulating the assize of bread and
                    ale, furnishes a clear proof of the little intercourse that must have subsisted
                    at that time between town and country. “Brewers in cities,” says the statute,
                    “may well afford to sell two gallons of beer or ale for a penny, and out of
                    cities three or four gallons for a penny.”</p>
                <p>Several laws were made in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, permitting the
                    exportation of grain when the price of wheat did not exceed six shillings and
                    eightpence a quarter; and in 1463 importation was prohibited when the price was
                    lower. The last statute, however, was little attended to, and foreign grain was
                    admitted as before; while the state of the country, and the restrictions on
                    internal commerce, scarcely permitted any advantage to be derived from the acts
                    allowing exportation.</p>
                <p>In Mr Chalmers’s <hi rend="italic">Caledonia,</hi> a great many valuable notices
                    are collected regarding the husbandry of Scotland during these ages. It is
                    evident from his elaborate researches, that the progress of cultivation in the
                    13th century had been greater than we should have expected from the turbulence
                    of the times, and the comparatively rude and uncivilized state of society.
                    Purveyance, and other obstructions to improvement, were nearly the same in
                    Scotland as in England; the laws regarding the corn trade appear, in some
                    instances, to have been copied from those of England; and in the northern, as in
                    the southern part of the island, the clergy were by far the most skilful and
                    industrious husbandmen.</p>
                <p>Yet it is difficult to reconcile the idea of any considerable improvement,
                    particularly in so far as regards the extensive cultivation of wheat (which Mr
                    Chalmers infers from the authorities he quotes), with an act passed in 1426,
                    which ordained every husbandman tilling with a plough of eight oxen to sow at
                    least a firlot (little more than a Winchester busheD of wheat, and half a firlot
                    of peas, with a proportion of beans; or with the state of the districts only a
                    few years ago, where wheat is said to have been extensively grown at that early
                    period.</p>
                <p>By statute 1449, the tenant was for the first time secured in possession, during
                    the term of his lease, against a purchaser of the land; and in 1469 he was
                    protected from having his property carried oft’ for the landlord’s debts, beyond
                    the amount of rent actually due; an enactment which proves his miserable
                    condition before that time.</p>
                <p>Soon after the beginning of the 16th century, agriculture partook of the general
                    improvement which followed the invention of printing, the revival of learning,
                    and the more settled authority of government; and instead of the occasional
                    notices of historians, we can now refer to regular treatises, written by men who
                    engaged eagerly in this neglected and hitherto degraded occupation. We shall
                    therefore give a short account of the principal works, as well as of the laws
                    and general policy of Britain, in regard to agriculture, from the early part of
                    the sixteenth century to the Revolution in 1688, when a new era commenced in the
                    legislation of corn, and soon after in the practice of the cultivator.</p>
                <p>The first and by far the best of our early works is the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Husbandry,</hi> printed in 1534, commonly ascribed to Fitzherbert, a judge of
                    the common pleas in the reign of Henry VIII. This was followed, in 1539, by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Book of Surveying and Improvements,</hi> by the same author.
                    In the former treatise we have a clear and minute description of the rural
                    practices of that period, and from the latter may be learned a good deal of the
                    economy of the feudal system in its decline. The <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Husbandry</hi> has scarcely been excelled by any later production, in as far as
                    concerns the subjects of which it treats; for at that time cultivated herbage
                    and edible roots were still unknown in England. The author writes from his own
                    experience of more than forty years; and, with the exception of passages
                    denoting his belief in the superstition of the Roman writers, there is very
                    little of this valuable work that should be omitted, and not a great deal that
                    need be added, in so far as regards the culture of corn, in a manual of
                    husbandry adapted even to the present time. Fitzherbert touches on almost every
                    department of the art, and in about a hundred octavo pages has contrived to
                    condense more practical information than will be found scattered through as many
                    volumes of later times; and yet he is minute even to the extreme on points of
                    real utility. There is no reason to say, with Mr Harte, that he had revived the
                    husbandry of the Romans; he merely describes the practices of the age in which
                    he lived; and from his commentary on the old statute <hi rend="italic"
                    >extenta</hi><hi rend="italic">manerii,</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Surveying,</hi> in which he does not allude to any recent improvements, it is
                    probable that the management which he details had been long established. But it
                    may surprise some of the agriculturists of the present day to be told, that,
                    after the lapse of almost three centuries, Fitzherbert’s practice, in some
                    material branches, has not been improved upon; and that in several districts
                    abuses still exist, which were as clearly pointed out by him at that early
                    period as by any writer of the present age.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Book of Husbandry</hi> begins with the plough and other
                    instruments, which are concisely and yet minutely described; and then about a
                    third part of it is occupied with the several operations as they succeed one
                    another throughout the year. Among other things in this part of the work, the
                    following deserve notice :—“Somme (ploughs) wyll tourn the sheld bredith at
                    every landsende, and plowe all one way ;” the same kind of plough that is now
                    found so useful on hilly grounds. Of wheel-ploughs he observes, that “they be
                    good on even grounde that lyeth <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033124"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3124-0255"/>lyghte and on such lands they are still most
                    commonly employed. Cart-wheels were sometimes bound with iron, of which he
                    greatly approves. On the much agitated question about the employment of horses
                    or oxen in labour, the most important arguments are distinctly stated. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> u</hi> In somme places,” he says, “a horse plough is
                    better,” and in others an oxen plough, to which, upon the whole, he gives the
                    preference; and to this, considering the practices of that period, they were
                    probably entitled. Beans and peas seem to have been common crops. He mentions
                    the different kinds of wheat, barley, and oats; and after describing the method
                    of harrowing “all maner of comnes,” we find the roller employed. “They use to
                    role their barley grounde after a showr of rayne, to make the grounde even to
                    mowe.” Under the article “To falowe,” he observes, “the greater clottes (clods)
                    the better wheate, for the clottes kepe the wheat warme all wynter; and at March
                    they will melte and breake and fal in manye small peces, the whiche is a newe
                    dongynge and refreshynge of the come.” This is agreeable to the present
                    practice, founded on the very same reasons. “In May, the shepe folde is to be
                    set out;” but Fitzherbert does not much approve of folding, and points out its
                    disadvantages in a very judicious manner. “In the later end of May and the
                    begynnynge of June, is tyme to wede the corne and then we have an accurate
                    description of the different weeds, and the instruments and mode of weeding.
                    Next comes a second ploughing of the fallow; and afterwards, in the latter end
                    of June, the mowing of the meadows begins. Of this operation, and of the forks
                    and rakes, and the haymaking, there is a very good account. The corn harvest
                    naturally follows: rye and wheat were usually <hi rend="italic">shorn,</hi> and
                    barley and oats cut with the scythe. This intelligent writer does not approve of
                    the practice, which still prevails in some places, of cutting wheat high, and
                    then mowing the stubbles. “In Somersetshire,” he says, “they do shere theyr
                    wheat very lowe; and the wheate strawe that they purpose to make <hi
                    rend="italic">thacke</hi> of, they do not threshe it, but cut off the ears, and
                    bynd it in sheves, and call it <hi rend="italic">rede,</hi> and therewith they
                    thacke theyr houses.” He recommends the practice of setting up corn in shocks,
                    with two sheaves to cover eight, instead of ten sheaves, as at present; probably
                    owing to the straw being then shorter. The corn was commonly housed; but if
                    there be a want of room, he advises that the ricks be built on a scaffold, and
                    not upon the ground. Com-stacks are now beginning to be built on pillars and
                    frames. The fallow received a third ploughing in September, and was sown about
                    Michaelmas. “Wheat is moost commonlye sowne under the forowe, that is to say,
                    cast it uppon the falowe, and then plowe it under and this branch of his subject
                    is concluded with directions about threshing, winnowing, and other kinds of
                    barn-work.</p>
                <p>Fitzherbert next proceeds to live stock. “An hous-bande,” he says, “can not well
                    thryue by his corne without he have other cattell, nor by his cattell without
                    corne. And bycause that shepe, in myne opynyon, is the mooste profytablest
                    cattell that any man can haue, therefore I pourpose to speake fyrst of shepe.”
                    His remarks on this subject are so accurate, that one might imagine they came
                    from a storemaster of the present day; and the minutiae which he details are
                    exactly what the writer of this article has seen practised in the hilly parts of
                    this country. In some places at present, “they neuer seuer their lambes from
                    their dammes ;” “and the poore of the peeke (high) countreye, and such other
                    places, where, as they vsc to milke theyr ewes, they use to wayne theyr lambes
                    at 12 weekes okle, and to mylke their ewes fiue or syxe weekes but that, he
                    observes, “is greate hurte to the ewes, and wyll cause them that they wyll not
                    take the ramme at the tyme of the yere for pouertye, but goo barreyne.” “In June
                    is tyme to shere shepe; and ere they be shorne, they must be verye well washen,
                    the which shall be to the owner greate profyte in the sale of his wool, and also
                    to the clothe-maker.” It appears that <hi rend="italic">hand washing</hi> was
                    then a common practice ;' and yet in the west and north of Scotland, at this
                    day, sheep are never washed at all. His remarks on horses, cattle, &amp;c. are
                    not less interesting; and there is a very good account of the diseases of each
                    species, and some just observations on the advantage of mixing different kinds
                    on the same pasture. Swine and bees conclude this branch of the work.</p>
                <p>The author then points out the great advantages of inclosures; recommends
                    “quycksettynge, dychynge, and hedgeyng ;” and gives particular directions about
                    the <hi rend="italic">settes,</hi> and the method of training a hedge, as well
                    as concerning the planting and management of trees. We have then a short
                    information “for a yonge gentylman that intendeth to thryue,” and “a prolonge
                    for the wiues occupation,” in some instances rather too homely for the present
                    time. Among other things, she is to “make her husband and herself somme clothes
                    ;” and “she maye haue the lockes of the shepe eyther to make blankettes and
                    courlettes, or bothe.” This is not so much amiss; but what follows will bring
                    our learned judge into disrepute even with our most industrious housewives. “It
                    is a wyues occupation,” he says, “to wynowe all maner of cornes, to make malte,
                    to washe and wrynge, to make heye, shere corne, and, in time of nede, to lιelpe
                    her husbande to fyll the mucke wayne or dounge carte, dryue the ploughe, to
                    loode heye, corne, and suche other; and to go or ride to the market to sei
                    butter, chese, mylke, egges, chekyns, capons, hennes, pygges, gese, and all
                    maner of cornes.” The rest of the book contains some useful advices about
                    diligence and economy; and concludes, after the manner of the age, with many
                    pious exhortations.</p>
                <p>Such is Fitzherbert’s <hi rend="italic">Book of Husbandry,</hi> and such was the
                    state of agriculture in England in the early part of the sixteenth century, and
                    probably for a long time before; for he nowhere speaks of the practices which he
                    describes or recommends as of recent introduction.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Book of Surveying</hi> adds considerably to our knowledge
                    of the rural economy of that age. “Four maner of commens” are described; several
                    kinds of mills for corn and other purposes, and also “quernes that goo with hand
                    ;” different orders of tenants, down to the “boundmen,” who “in some places
                    contynue as yet ;” “and many tymes, by colour thereof, there be many freemen
                    taken as boundmen, and their lands and goods is taken from them.” Lime and marl
                    are mentioned as common manures; and the former was sometimes spread on the
                    surface to destroy heath. Both draining and irrigation are noticed, though the
                    latter but slightly. And the work concludes with an inquiry “how to make a
                    township that is worth XX. marke a yere, worth XX. li. a year from which we
                    shall give a specimen of the author’s manner, as well as of the economy of the
                    age.</p>
                <p>“It is undoubted, that to every townshyppe that standeth in tyllage in the playne

                    they may nat abyde in the fylde before the heerdmen in winter tyme for colde.
                    And those that lye in a close under a hedge haue longe heare and thyck, and they

                    moche more than al these, for by reason of these closes he shall save meate,
                    drinke, and wages of a shepeherde, the wages of the heerdman, and the wages of
                    the swine herde, the which may fortune to be as chargeable as all his holle
                    rent; and also his come shall be better saved from eatinge or destroyeng with

                    be put out of wages. To that it may be answered, though these occupations be not
                    used, there be as many newe occupations that were not used before; as getting of
                    quickesettes, diching, hedging, and plashing, the which the same men may use and
                    occupye.”</p>
                <p>The next author who writes professedly on agriculture is Tusser, whose <hi

                    formerly in such high repute as to be recommended by Lord Molesworth to be
                    taught in schools.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some

                    the book of husbandry consists of 118 pages; and then follows the <hi
                    rend="italic">Points of Housewifrie,</hi> occupying 42 pages more. It is written
                    in verse. Amidst a vast heap of rubbish, there are some useful notices
                    concerning the state of agriculture at the time in different parts of England.
                    Hops, which had been introduced in the early part of the sixteenth century, and
                    on the culture of which a treatise was published in 1574 by Reynolde Scott, are
                    mentioned as a well-known crop. Buckwheat was sown after barley. It seems to
                    have been the practice then, in some places, to “<hi rend="italic">geld
                    fillies”</hi> as well as colts. Hemp and flax are mentioned as common crops.
                    Inclosures must have been numerous in several counties; and there is a very good
                    comparison between “champion (open fields) country, and several,” which Blythe
                    afterwards transcribed into his <hi rend="italic">Improver Improved.</hi>
                    Carrots, cabbages, turnips, and rape, are mentioned among the herbs and roots

                    as in Fitzherbert’s works. This author’s division of the crop is rather curious,
                    though probably quite inaccurate, if he means that the whole rent might be paid
                    by a tenth of the com.</p>

                <p>The next writer is <hi rend="italic">Barnaby Googe,</hi> whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Whole Art of Husbandry</hi> was printed in 1578, and again by Markham in 1614.
                    The first edition is merely a translation of a German work; and very little is
                    said of English husbandry in the second, though Markham made some trifling
                    interpolations, in order, as it is alleged, to adapt the German husbandry to the
                    English climate. It is for the most part made up of gleanings from the ancient
                    writers of Greece and Rome, whose errors are faithfully retained, with here and
                    there some description of the practices of the age, in which there is little of
                    novelty or importance. Googe mentions a number of English writers who lived
                    about the time of Fitzherbert, whose works have not been preserved.</p>
                <p>For more than fifty years after this, or till near the middle of the seventeenth
                    century, there are no systematic works on husbandry, though several treatises on
                    particular departments of it. From these it is evident, that all the different
                    operations of the farmer were performed with more care and correctness than
                    formerly; that the fallows were better worked, the fields kept freer of weeds,
                    and much more attention paid to manures of every kind. A few of the writers of
                    this period deserve to be shortly noticed.</p>
                <p>Sir Hugh Plat, in his <hi rend="italic">Jewel House of Art and Nature,</hi>
                    printed in 1594 (which Weston in his catalogue erroneously gives to Gabriel
                    Plattes), makes some useful observations on manures, but chiefly collected from
                    other writers. His censure of the practice of leaving farm dung lying scattered
                    about is among the most valuable.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033150" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3150-0257"/>
                <p>Sir John Norden’s <hi rend="italic">Surveyor’s Dialogue,</hi> printed in 1607,
                    and reprinted with additions in 1618, is a work of considerable merit. The first
                    three books of it relate to the rights of the lord of the manor, and the various
                    tenures by which landed property was then held, with the obligations which they
                    imposed. Among others, we find the singular custom so humorously described in
                    the Spectator, of the incontinent widow riding upon a ram. In the fifth book
                    there are a good many judicious observations on the “different natures of
                    grounds, how they may be employed, how they may be bettered, reformed, and
                    amended.” The famous meadows near Salisbury are mentioned; and when cattle have
                    fed their fill, hogs, it is pretended, “are made fat with the remnant; namely,
                    with the knots and sappe of the grasse.” “Clouer grasse, or the grasse honey
                    suckle” (white clover), is directed to be sown with other hay seeds. “Carrot
                    rootes” were then raised in several parts of England, and sometimes by farmers.
                    London street and stable dung was carried to a distance by water, though it
                    appears from later writers to have been got for the trouble of removing. And
                    leases of 21 years are recommended for persons of small capital, as better than
                    employing it in purchasing land; an opinion that prevails very generally among
                    our present farmers.</p>
                <p>Bees seem to have been great favourites with these early writers; and among
                    others, there is a treatise by Butler, a gentleman of Oxford, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Feminine</hi><hi rend="italic">Monarchie,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Bees,</hi> printed in 1609, full of all manner of
                    quaintness and pedantry.</p>
                <p>We shall pass over Markham, Mascall, Gabriel Plattes, and several other authors
                    of this period, the best part of their writings being preserved by Blythe and
                    Hartlib, of whom we shall say a little immediately. In Sir Richard Weston’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Discourse on the Husbandry of Brabant and Flanders,</hi> published
                    by Hartlib in 1645, we may mark the dawn of the vast improvements which have
                    since been effected in Britain. This gentleman was ambassador from England to
                    the elector palatine and king of Bohemia in 1619, and had the merit of being the
                    first who introduced the <hi rend="italic">great clover,</hi> as it was then
                    called, into English agriculture, about 1645, and probably turnips also. His
                    directions for the cultivation of clover are better than was to be expected. It
                    thrives best, he says, when you sow it on the worst and barrcnest ground, such
                    as our worst heath ground is in England. The ground is to be pared and burnt,
                    and unslacked lime must be added to the ashes. It is next to be well ploughed
                    and harrowed; and about ten pounds of clover seed must be sown on an acre in
                    April or the end of March. If you intend to preserve seed, then the second crop
                    must be let stand till it come to a full and dead ripeness; and you shall have
                    at the least five bushels per acre. Being once sown, it will last five years;
                    and then being ploughed, it will yield, three or four years together, rich crops
                    of wheat, and after that a crop of oats, with which clover seed is to be sown
                    again. It is in itself an excellent manure, Sir Richard adds; and so it should
                    be, to enable land to bear this treatment. In less than ten years after its
                    introduction, that is, before 1655, the culture of clover, exactly according to
                    the present method, seems to have been well known in England, and it had also
                    made its way to Ireland.</p>
                <p>A great many works on agriculture appeared during the time of the commonwealth,
                    of which Blythe’s <hi rend="italic">Improver Improved,</hi> and Hartlib’s <hi

                    former was published in 1649, and of the latter in 1650; and both of them were
                    enlarged in subsequent editions. In the first edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Improver Improved,</hi> no mention is made of clover, nor in the second of
                    turnips; but in the third, published in 1662, clover is treated of at some
                    length, and turnips are recommended as an excellent cattle crop, the culture of
                    which should be extended from the kitchen garden to the field. Sir Richard
                    Weston must have cultivated turnips before this; for Blythe says, that Sir
                    Richard affirmed to himself he did feed his swine with them. They were first
                    given boiled, but afterwards the swine came to eat them raw, and would run after
                    the carts, and pull them forth as they gathered them; an expression which
                    conveys an idea of their being cultivated in the fields.</p>
                <p>Blythe’s book is the first systematic work in which there are some traces of the
                    alternate husbandry so beneficially established since, by interposing clover and
                    turnip between culmiferous crops. He is a great enemy to commons and common
                    fields, and to retaining land in old pasture, unless it be of the best quality.
                    His description of the different kinds of ploughs is interesting; and he justly
                    recommends such as were drawn by two horses (some even by one horse), in
                    preference to the weighty and clumsy machines which required four or more horses
                    or oxen. Almost all the manures now used seem to have been then well known; and
                    he brought lime himself from a distance of 20 miles. He speaks of an instrument
                    which ploughed, sowed, and harrowed at the same time; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >setting of corn</hi> was then a subject of much discussion. “It was not many
                    years,” says Blythe, “since the famous city of London petitioned the parliament
                    of England against two anusancies or offensive commodities, which were likely to
                    come into great use and esteem; and that was Newcastle coal, in regard of their
                    stench, &amp;c., and hops, in regard they would spoyle the taste of drink, and
                    endanger the people.”</p>
                <p>Hartlib’s <hi rend="italic">Legacy</hi> is a very heterogeneous performance,
                    containing, among some very judicious directions, a great deal of rash
                    speculation. Several of the deficiencies which the writer complains of in
                    English agriculture must be placed to the account of our climate, and never have
                    been or can be supplied. Some of his recommendations are quite unsuitable to the
                    state of the country, and display more of general knowledge and good intention,
                    than of either the theory or practice of agriculture. Among the subjects
                    deserving notice may be mentioned the practice of steeping and liming seed corn
                    as a preventive of smut; changing every year the <hi rend="italic">species</hi>
                    of grain, and bringing seed corn from a distance; ploughing down green crops as
                    manure; and feeding horses with broken oats and chaff. This writer seems to
                    differ a good deal from Blythe about the advantage of interchanging tillage and
                    pasture. “It were no losse to this island,” he says, “if that we should not
                    plough at all, if so be that we could certainly have corn at a reasonable rate,
                    and likewise vent for all our manufactures of wool and one reason for this is,
                    that pasture employeth more hands than tillage, instead of depopulating the
                    country, as was commonly imagined. The <hi rend="italic">grout,</hi> which he
                    mentions “as coming over to us in Holland ships,” about which he desires
                    information, was probably the same with our present shelled barley; and mills
                    for manufacturing it were introduced into Scotland from Holland towards the
                    beginning of the last century.</p>
                <p>To the third edition, published in 1655, are subjoined Dr Beatic’s Annotations,
                    with the writer of the Legacy’s answers, both of them ingenious, and sometimes
                    instructive. But this cannot be said of Gabriel Plattes’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercurius Laetificans,</hi> also added to this edition, which is a most
                    extravagant production. There are also several communications from Hartlib’s
                    different correspondents, of which the most interesting are those on the early
                    cultivation and great value of clover. Hartlib himself does not appear much in
                    this collection; but he seems to have been a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033163"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3163-0258"/>very useful person in editing the works of others,
                    and as a collector of miscellaneous information on rural subjects. It is strange
                    that neither Blythe nor Hartlib, nor any of Hartlib’s correspondents, seem ever
                    to have heard of Fitzherbert’s works.</p>
                <p>Among the other writers previous to the Revolution, we shall only mention Ray the
                    botanist and Evelyn, both men of great talents and research, whose works are
                    still in high estimation. A new edition of Evelyn’s <hi rend="italic">Silva and
                    Terra</hi> was published in 1777 by Dr Hunter, with large notes and elegant
                    engravings, and reprinted in 1812.</p>
                <p>The preceding review commences with a period of feudal anarchy and despotism, and
                    comes down to the time when the exertions of individual interest were protected
                    and encouraged by the firm administration of equal laws; when the prosperity of
                    Great Britain was no longer retarded by internal commotions, nor endangered by
                    hostile invasion.</p>
                <p>The laws of this period, in so far as they relate to agriculture and rural
                    economy, display a similar progress in improvement.</p>
                <p>From the beginning of the reign of Henry VII. to the end of Elizabeth’s, a number
                    of statutes were made for the encouragement of tillage, though probably to
                    little purpose. The great grievance of those days was the practice of laying
                    arable land to pasture, and suffering the farm-houses to fall to ruin. “Where in
                    some towns,” says the statute 4th Henry VII. (1488), “two hundred persons were
                    occupied and lived of their lawful labours, now there arc occupied two or three
                    herdsmen, and the residue fall into idleness therefore it is ordained, that
                    houses which within three years have been let for farms, with twenty acres of
                    land lying in tillage or husbandry, shall be upheld, under the penalty of half
                    the profits, to be forfeited to the king or the lord of the fee. Almost half a
                    century afterwards, the practice had become still more alarming; and in 1534 a
                    new act was tried, apparently with as little success. “Some have 24,000 sheep,
                    some 20,000 sheep, some 10,000, some 6000, some 4000, and some more and some
                    less and yet it is alleged the price of wool had nearly doubled, “sheep being
                    come to a few persons’ hands.” A penalty was therefore imposed on all who kept
                    above 2000 sheep; and no person was to take in farm more than two tenements of
                    husbandry. By the 39th Elizabeth (1597), arable land made pasture since the 1st
                    Elizabeth shall be again converted into tillage, and what is arable shall not be
                    converted into pasture.</p>
                <p>Many laws were enacted during this period against vagabonds, as they were called;
                    and persons who could not find employment seem to have been sometimes confounded
                    with those who really preferred idleness and plunder. The dissolution of the
                    feudal system, and the suppression of the monasteries, deprived a great part of
                    the rural population of the means of support. They could not be employed in
                    cultivating the soil, for there was no middle class of farmers possessed of
                    capital to be vested in improvements; and what little disposable capital was in
                    the hands of great proprietors could not, in those rude times, be so
                    advantageously embarked in the expensive and precarious labours of growing eom,
                    as in pasturage, which required much less skill and superintendence. Besides,
                    there was a constant demand for wool on the Continent; while the corn-market was
                    not only confined by laws against exportation, but fettered by restrictions on
                    the internal trade. The laws regarding the wages of labour and the price of
                    provisions are a further proof of the ignorance of the age in regard to the
                    proper subject of legislation.</p>
                <p>By the statute 1552 it is declared, that any person that shall buy merchandise,
                    victual, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> coming to market, or make any bargain
                    for buying the same before they shall be in the market ready to be sold, or
                    shall make any motion for enhancing the price, or dissuade any person from
                    coming to market, or forbear to bring any of the things to market, &amp;c. shall
                    be deemed a <hi rend="italic">forestaller.</hi> Any person who buys and sells
                    again in the same market, or within four miles thereof, shall be reputed a <hi
                    rend="italic">regrater.</hi> Any person buying corn growing in the fields, or
                    any other corn, with intent to sell again, shall be reputed an unlawful <hi
                    rend="italic">ingrosser.</hi> It was also declared, that no person shall sell
                    cattle within five weeks after he had bought them. Licences, indeed, were to be
                    granted in certain cases, and particularly when the price of wheat was at or
                    under 6s. 8d. a quarter, and other kinds of grain in that proportion.</p>
                <p>The laws regarding the exportation and importation of corn during this period
                    could have had little effect in encouraging agriculture, though towards the
                    latter part of it they gradually approached that system which was finally
                    established at and soon after the Revolution. From the time of the
                    above-mentioned statute against forestalled, which effectually prevented
                    exportation, as well as the freedom of the home trade, when corn was above the
                    price therein specified, down to 1688, there are at least twelve statutes on
                    this subject; and some of them are so nearly the same, that it is probable they
                    were not very carefully observed. The price at which wheat was allowed to be
                    exported was raised from 6s. 8d. a quarter, the price fixed by the 1st and 2d of
                    Philip and Mary (1553), to 10s. in 1562; to 20s. in 1593; to 26s. 8d. in 1604;
                    to 32s. in 1623; to 40s. in 1660 ∙ to 48s. in 1663; and at last, in 1670,
                    exportation was virtually permitted without limitation. Certain duties, however,
                    were payable, which in some cases seem to have amounted to a prohibition; and
                    until 1660 importation was not restrained even in years of plenty and cheapness.
                    In permitting exportation, the object appears to have been revenue rather than
                    the encouragement of production.</p>
                <p>The first statute for levying tolls at turnpikes, to make or repair roads in
                    England, passed in 1662.</p>
                <p>Of the state of agriculture in Scotland in the 16th and the greater part of the
                    17th century, very little is known; no professed treatise on the subject
                    appeared till after the Revolution. The south-eastern counties were the earliest
                    improved, and yet in 1660 their condition seems to have been very wretched. Ray,
                    who made a tour along the eastern coast in that year, says, “we observed little
                    or <hi rend="italic">no fallow grounds</hi> in Scotland; some ley ground we saw,
                    which they manured with sea wreck. The men seemed to be very lazy, and may be
                    frequently observed to plough in their cloaks. It is the fashion of them to wear
                    cloaks when they go abroad, but especially on. Sundays. They have neither good
                    bread, cheese, nor drink. They cannot make them, nor will they learn. Their
                    butter is very indifferent, and one would wonder how they could contrive to make
                    it so bad. They use much pottage made of coalwort, which they call <hi
                    rend="italic">kail,</hi> sometimes broth of decorticated barley. The ordinary
                    country-houses are pitiful cots, built of stone and covered with turfs, having
                    in them but one room, many of them no chimneys, the windows very small holes,
                    and not glazed. The ground in the valleys and plains bears very good corn, but
                    especially bears barley or bigge, and oats, but rarely wheat and rye.”<note

                <p>It is probable that no great change had taken place in Scotland from the end of
                    the 15th century, except that tenants gradually became possessed of a little
                    stock of their own, instead of having their farm stocked by the landlord. “The
                    minority of James V., the reign of Mary Stuart, the infancy of her son, and the
                    civil wars of her grandson Charles L, were all periods of lasting waste. The
                    very laws which were made during successive reigns, for protecting the tillers
                    of the soil from spoil, are the best proofs of the deplorable state of the
                    husbandman.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Chalmers’s

                <p>Yet in the 17th century were those laws made which paved the way for the present
                    improved system of agriculture in Scotland; By statute 1633, landholders were
                    enabled to have their tithes valued, and to buy them either at nine or six
                    years’ purchase, according to the nature of the property. The statute 1685,
                    conferring on landlords a power to entail their estates, was indeed of a very
                    different tendency in regard to its effects on agriculture. But the two acts in
                    1695, for the division of commons, and separation of intermixed properties, have
                    facilitated in an eminent degree the progress of improvement.</p>
                <p>' From the Revolution to the accession of George III. the 'progress of
                    agriculture was by no means so considerable as we should be led to imagine from

                    cultivation of the soil or in the management of live stock, from the Restoration
                    down to the middle of last century. Even clover and turnips, the great support
                    of the present improved system of agriculture, were confined to a few districts,
                    and at the latter period were scarcely cultivated at all by common farmers in
                    the northern part of the island. Of the writers of this <hi rend="superscript">

                    in the modes of culture, or some extension of the practices that were formerly
                    little known.</p>
                <p>In Houghton’s <hi rend="italic">Collections on Husbandry and Trade,</hi> a
                    periodical work begun in 1681, we have the first notice of turnips being eaten
                    by sheep. “Some in Essex have their fallow after turnips, which feed their sheep
                    in winter, by which means the turnips are scooped, and so made capable to hold
                    dews and rain water, which, by corrupting, imbibes the nitre of the air, and
                    when the shell breaks it runs about and fertilizes. By feeding the sheep, the
                    land is dunged as if it had been folded; and those turnips, though few or none
                    be carried off for human use, are a very excellent improvement, nay, some reckon
                    it so though they only plough the turnips in without feeding.”<note

                    This was written in February 1694; but ten years before, Worlidge, one of his
                    correspondents, observes, “sheep fatten very well on turnips, which prove an
                    excellent nourishment for them in hard winters, when fodder is scarce; for they
                    will not only eat the greens, but feed on the roots in the ground, and scoop
                    them hollow even to the very skin. Ten acres (he adds) sown with clover,
                    turnips, &amp;c. will feed as many sheep as one hundred acres thereof would
                    before have done.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid.

                    Raleigh; and he stopping at Ireland, some was planted there, where it thrived
                    very well, and to good purpose; for in their succeeding wars, when all the corn
                    above the ground was destroyed, this supported them; for the soldiers, unless
                    they had dug up all the ground where they grew, and almost sifted it, could not
                    extirpate them; from whence they were brought to Lancashire, where they are very
                    numerous, and now they begin to spread all the kingdom over. They are a pleasant
                    food boiled or roasted, and eaten with butter and sugar. There is a sort brought
                    from Spain, that are of a longer form, and are more luscious than ours; they are

                <p>The next writer is Mortimer, whose <hi rend="italic">Whole Art of Husbandry</hi>
                    was published in 1706, and has since run through several editions. It is a
                    regular, systematic work, of considerable merit; and it does not appear that
                    much improvement has been made since in the practices he describes, in many
                    parts of Britain. From the third edition of Hartlib’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Legacy,</hi> we learn that clover was cut green, and given to cattle; and it
                    appears that this practice of <hi rend="italic">soiling,</hi> as it is now
                    called, had become very common about the beginning of last century, wherever
                    clover was cultivated. Ryegrass was now sown along with it. Turnips were
                    hand-hoed, and extensively employed in feeding sheep and cattle, in the same
                    manner as at present.</p>
                <p>The first considerable improvement in the practice of that period was introduced
                    by Jethro Tull, a gentleman of Berkshire, who began to drill wheat and other
                    crops about the year 1701, and whose <hi rend="italic">Horse-hoeing
                    Husbandry</hi> was published in 1731. In giving a short account of the
                    innovations of this eccentric writer, it is not meant to enter into any
                    discussion of their merits. It will not detract much from his reputation to
                    admit that, like most other men who leave the beaten path, he was sometimes
                    misled by inexperience, and sometimes deceived by a too sanguine imagination.
                    Had Tull confined his recommendation of the drill husbandry to leguminous and
                    bulbous-rooted plants generally, and to the <hi rend="italic">cereal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gramina</hi> only in particular circumstances; and had he, without
                    puzzling himself about the food of plants, been contented with pointing out the
                    great advantage of pulverizing the soil in most cases, and extirpating weeds in
                    every case, he would certainly have deserved a high rank among the benefactors
                    of his country. A knowledge of his doctrines and practice, however, will serve
                    as a necessary introduction to the present approved modes of culture.</p>
                <p>Tull’s theory is promulgated with great confidence; and in the controversy which
                    he thought proper to maintain in support of it, he scrupled not to employ
                    ridicule as well as reasoning. Besides the Roman writers <hi rend="italic">De
                    Re</hi><hi rend="italic">Rustica,</hi> Virgil in particular, whom he treats with
                    high disdain, he is almost equally severe on Woodward, Bradley, and other
                    writers of his own time.</p>
                <p>As the distance between his rows appeared much greater than was necessary for the
                    range of the roots of the plants, Tull begins by showing that these roots extend
                    much farther than is commonly believed, and then proceeds to inquire into the
                    nature of their food. After examining several hypotheses, he decides this to be
                    fine particles of earth. The chief, and almost the only use of dung, he thinks,
                    is to divide the earth, to dissolve “this terrestrial matter, which affords
                    nutriment to the mouths of vegetable roots and this can be done more
                    complcte-Iy<pb break="no" facs="nls:193033189" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3189-0260"/> by
                    tillage. It is therefore necessary not only to pulverize the soil by repeated
                    ploughings before it be seeded, but, as it becomes gradually more and more
                    compressed afterwards, recourse must be had to tillage while the plants are
                    growing, and this is <hi rend="italic">hoeing,</hi> which also destroys the
                    weeds that would deprive the plants of their nourishment.</p>
                <p>The leading features of Tull’s husbandry are his practice of laying the land into
                    narrow ridges of five or six feet, and upon the middle of these drilling one,
                    two, or three rows, distant from one another about seven inches when there were
                    three, and ten inches when only two. The distance of the plants on one ridge
                    from those on the contiguous one he called an <hi rend="italic">interval</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the distance between the rows on the same ridge, a <hi

                    >:</hi> the former was stirred repeatedly by the horse-hoe, the latter by the
                    hand-hoe.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary attention this ingenious person gave to his mode of culture is
                    perhaps without a parallel :—·“I formerly was at much pains,” he says, “and at
                    some charge in improving my drills for planting the rows at very near distances,
                    and had brought them to such perfection, that one horse would draw a drill with
                    eleven shares, making the rows at three inches and a half distance from one
                    another; and at the same time sow in them three very different sorts of seeds,
                    which did not mix; and these, too, at different depths. As the barleyrows were
                    seven inches asunder, the barley lay four inches deep. A little more than three
                    inches above that, in the same channels, was clover; betwixt every two of these
                    rows was a row of St Foin, covered half an inch deep.</p>
                <p>“I had a good crop of barley the first year; the next year two crops of broad
                    clover, where that was sown; and where hop-clover was sown, a mixed crop of that
                    and St Foin; but I am since, by experience, so fully convinced of the folly of
                    these, or any other mixed crops, and more especially of narrow spaces, that I
                    have demolished these instruments in their full perfection as a vain curiosity,
                    the drift and use of them being contrary to the true principles and practice of
                    horse-hoeing.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Horse-hoeing Husbandry, p. G2. Lond. 1762.</p></note>”</p>
                <p>In the culture of wheat, he began with ridges six feet broad, or eleven on a
                    breadth of 66 feet; but on this he afterwards had fourteen ridges. After trying
                    different numbers of rows on a ridge, he at last preferred two, with an
                    intervening space of about ten inches. He allowed only three pecks of seed for
                    an acre. The first hoeing was performed by turning a furrow from the row, as
                    soon as the plant had put forth four or five leaves; so that it was done before
                    or at the beginning of winter. The next hoeing was in spring, by which the earth
                    was returned to the plants. The subsequent operations depended upon the
                    circumstances and condition of the land and the state of the weather. The next
                    year’s crop of wheat was sown upon the intervals which had been unoccupied the
                    former year; but this he does not seem to think was a matter of much
                    consequence. “My field,” he observes, “whereon is now the thirteenth crop of
                    wheat, has shown that the rows may successfully stand upon any part of the
                    ground. The ridges of this field were, for the twelfth crop, changed from six
                    feet to four feet six inches. In order for this alteration the ridges were
                    ploughed down, and then the next ridges were laid out the same way as the
                    former, but one foot six inches narrower, and the double rows drilled on their
                    tops; whereby, of consequence, there must be some row’s standing on every part
                    of the ground, both on the former partitions, and on every part of the
                    intervals. Notwithstanding this, there was no manner of difference in the
                    goodness of the row’s; and the whole field was in every part of it equal, and
                    the best I believe that ever grew on it. It is now the thirteenth crop, likely
                    to be good, though the land was not ploughed cross ways.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. P∙ 424.</p></note></p>
                <p>It follows from this singular management, that Tull thought a succession of crops
                    of different species altogether unnecessary; and he labours hard to prove
                    against Dr Woodward, that the advantages of such a change under his plan of
                    tillage were quite chimerical; though he seems to admit the benefit of a change
                    of the seed itself. But the best method of determining the question would have
                    been to have stated the amount of his crops per acre, and the quality of the
                    grain, instead of resting the superiority of his management on the alleged
                    saving of expense, when compared with the common broad-cast husbandry.</p>
                <p>On the culture of turnip, both his principles and his practice are much more
                    correct. The ridges w ere of the same breadth as for wheat, but only one row was
                    drilled on each. His management while the crop was growing differs very little
                    from the present practice. When drilled on the level, it is impossible, he
                    observes, to hoe-plough them so well as when they are planted upon ridges. But
                    the seed was deposited at different depths, the half about four inches deep, and
                    the other half exactly over that, at the depth of half an inch. “Thus planted,
                    let the weather be never so dry, the deepest seed will come up; but if it
                    raineth immediately after planting, the shallow will come up first. We also make
                    it come up at four times, by mixing our seed half new and half old, the new
                    coming up a day quicker than the old. These four comings up give it so many
                    chances for escaping the fly; it being often seen that the seed sown over night
                    will be destroyed by the fly, when that sown the next morning will escape, and
                    <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> or you may hoe-plough
                    them when the fly is like to devour them; this will bury the greatest part of
                    these enemies: or else you may drill in another row without new-ploughing the
                    land.”</p>
                <p>Drilling and horse and hand-hoeing seem to have been in use before the
                    publication of Tull’s book. “Hoeing,” he says, “may be divided into deep, which
                    is our horsehoeing; and shallow, which is the English hand-hoeing; and also the
                    shallow horse-hoeing used in some places betwixt rows, where the intervals are
                    very narrow, as 16 or 18 inches. This is but an imitation of the hand-hoe, or a
                    succedaneum to it, and can neither supply the use of dung nor fallow, and may be
                    properly called scratchhoeing.” But in his mode of forming ridges his practice
                    seems to have been original; his implements display much ingenuity; and his
                    claim to the title of father of the present horse-hoeing husbandry of Great
                    Britain seems indisputable. A translation of Tull’s book was undertaken at one
                    and the same time in France, by three different persons of consideration,
                    without the privity of each other. <hi rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> of them afterw
                    ards put their papers into the hands of the third, Μ. Du Hamel du Monceau of the
                    Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, who published a treatise on husbandry, on
                    the principles of Mr Tull, a few years after. But Tull seems to have had very
                    few followers in England for more than 30 years. The present method of drilling
                    and horse-hoeing turnips was not introduced into Northumberland till about the
                    year 1780;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Northumberland. Survey, p. 100.</p></note> and it was then borrowed from
                    Scotland, the farmers of which had the merit of first adopting Tull’s management
                    in the culture<pb break="no" facs="nls:193033202" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3202-0261"/>
                    of this root about 1760, and from whom it has since made its way, but slowly,
                    into the southern part of the island.</p>
                <p>Among the English writers of this period may be mentioned Bradley, Lawrence,
                    Hales, Miller, Ellis, Smith, Hill, Hitt, Lisle, and Home. Most of their works
                    went through several editions in a few years; at once a proof of the estimation
                    in which they were held, and of the direction of the public mind towards
                    investigating the principles and practice of agriculture.</p>
                <p>Of the progress of the art in Scotland, till towards the end of the 17th century,
                    we are almost entirely ignorant. The first work, written by Donaldson, was
                    printed in 1697, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Husbandry Anatomized; or,
                    an Inquiry into the Present Manner of Teiling and Manuring the Ground in
                    Scotland.</hi> It appears from this treatise, that the state of the art was not
                    more advanced at that time in North Britain than it had been in England in the
                    time of Fitzherbert. Farms were divided into infield and outfield; corn crops
                    followed one another without the intervention of fallow, cultivated herbage, or
                    turnips, though something is said about fallowing the outfield; inclosures were
                    very rare; the tenantry had not begun to emerge from a state of great poverty
                    and depression; and the wages of labour, compared with the price of com, were
                    much lower than at present; though that price, at least in ordinary years, must
                    appear extremely moderate in our times. Leases for a term of years, however,
                    were not uncommon; but the want of capital rendered it impossible for the
                    tenantry to attempt any spirited improvements.</p>
                <p>Donaldson first points out the common management of that period, which he shows
                    to have been very unproductive; and afterwards recommends what he thinks would
                    be a more profitable course. “Of the dale ground,” he says, “that is, such lands
                    as are partly hills and partly valleys, of which sorts may be comprehended the
                    greatest part of arable ground in this kingdom, I shall suppose a fanner to have
                    a lease or tack of three score acres, at three hundred merks of rent per annum
                    (L.16. 13s. 4d. sterling). Perhaps some who are not acquainted with rural
                    affairs may think this cheap; but those who are the possessors thereof think
                    otherwise, and find difficulty enough to get the same paid, according to their
                    present way of manuring thereof. But that I may proceed to the comparison, I
                    shall show how commonly this farm-room is managed. It is commonly divided into
                    two parts, viz. one-third croft, and two-thirds outfield, as it is termed. The
                    croft is usually divided into three parts; to wit, one-third barley, which is
                    always dunged that year barley is sown thereon; another third oats; and the last
                    third peas. The outside field is divided into two parts, to wit, the one half
                    oats, and the other half grass, two years successively. The product which may be
                    supposed to be on each acre of croft, four bolls (three Winchester quarters),
                    and that of the outfield, three (2^ quarters); the quota is seven score bolls,
                    which we shall also reckon at five pounds (8s. 4d.) per boll, cheap year and
                    dear year one with another. This, in all, is worth L.700 (L.58. 6s. 8d.
                    sterling).</p>
                <p>“Then let us see what profit he can make of his cattle. According to the division
                    of his lands, there is 20 acres of grass, which cannot be expected to be very
                    good, because it gets not leave to lie above two years, and therefore cannot be
                    well swarded. However, usually, besides four horses, which are kept for
                    ploughing the said land, ten or twelve nolt are also kept upon a farm-room of
                    the above-mentioned bounds ∙, but, in respect of the badness of the grass, as
                    said is, little profit is had of them. Perhaps two or three stone of butter is
                    the most that can be made of the milk of his kine the whole summer, and not
                    above two heffers brought up each year. As to what profit may be made by
                    bringing up young horses, I shall say nothing, supposing he keeps his stock good
                    by those of his own upbringing. The whole product, then, of his cattle cannot be
                    reckoned above fifty merks (L.2. 15s. 6d.). For, in respect his beasts are in. a
                    manner half-starved, they are generally small; so that scarce may a heffer be
                    sold at above twelve pounds (L.l sterling). The whole product of this farm-room,
                    therefore, exceeds not the value of L.733 (L.61. Is. 8d. sterling), or
                    thereabout.” The labourers employed on this farm were two men and one woman,
                    besides a herd in summer, and other servants in harvest.</p>
                <p>Donaldson then proceeds to point out a different mode of management, which he
                    calculates to be more profitable; but no notice is taken of either clover or
                    turnips as crops to be raised in his new course, though they are incidentally
                    noticed in other parts of the work.</p>
                <p>“I also recommend potatoes as a very profitable root for husbandmen and others
                    that have numerous families. And because there is a peculiar way of planting
                    this root, not commonly known in this country, I shall here show what way it is
                    ordinarily planted or set. The ground must be dry; and so much the better it is
                    if it have a good soard of grass. The beds or riggs are made about eight foot
                    broad, good store of dung being laid upon your ground; horse or sheep dung is
                    the proper manure for them. Throw each potatoe or sett (for they were sometimes
                    cut into setts) into a knot of dung, and afterwards dig earth out of the
                    furrows, and cover them all over, about some three or four inches deep; the
                    furrows left between your riggs must be about two foot broad, and little less
                    will they be in depth before your potatoes be covered. You need not plant this
                    root in your garden; they are commonly set in the fields, and wildest of ground,
                    for enriching of it.” As to their consumption, they were sometimes “boiled and
                    broken, and stirred with butter and new milk; also roasted, and eaten with
                    butter; yea, some make bread of them, by mixing them with oat or barley meal;
                    others parboil them, and bake them with apples, after the manner of tarts.”</p>
                <p>There is a good deal in this little treatise about sheep, and other branches of
                    husbandry; and, if the writer was well informed, as in most instances he appears
                    to have been, his account of prices, of wages, and generally of the practices of
                    that period, is very interesting.</p>
                <p>The next work on the husbandry of Scotland is, <hi rend="italic">The Countrymans
                    Rudiments, or an advice to the Farmers in East Lothian, how to labour and
                    improve their grounds</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> said to have been written by
                    Lord Belhaven about the time of the Union, and reprinted in 1723. In this we
                    have a deplorable picture of the state of agriculture in what is now the most
                    highly improved county in Scotland. His lordship begins with a very high
                    encomium on his own performance. “I dare be bold to say, there was never such a
                    good easy method of husbandry as this, so succinct, extensive, and methodical in
                    all its parts, published before.” And he bespeaks the favour of those to whom he
                    addresses himself, by adding, “neither shall I affright you with hedging,
                    ditching, marling, chalking, paring and burning, draining, watering, and Such
                    like, which are all very good improvements indeed, and very agreeable with the
                    soil and situation of East Lothian; but I know ye cannot bear as yet a crowd of
                    improvements, this being only intended to initiate you in the true method and
                    principles of husbandry.” The farm-rooms in East Lothian, as in other districts,
                    were divided into infield and outfield. “The infield (where wheat is sown) is
                    generally divided by the tenant into four divisions, or breaks, as they call
                    them, viz. one <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033215" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3215-0262"
                    />of wheat, one of barley, one of pease, and one of oats; so that the wheat is
                    sowed after the pease, the barley after the wheat, and the oats after the
                    barley. The outfield land is ordinarily made use of promiscuously for feeding of
                    their cows, horse, sheep, and oxen; 'tis also dunged by their sheep, who lay in
                    earthen folds; and sometimes, when they have much of it, they fauch or fallow a
                    part of it yearly.” Under this management the produce seems to have been three
                    times the seed; and yet, says his lordship, “if in East Lothian they did not
                    leave a higher stubble than in other places of the kingdom, their grounds would
                    be in a much worse condition than at present they are, though bad enough.”—“A
                    good crop of corn makes a good stubble, and a good stubble is the equalest
                    mucking that is.” Among the advantages of inclosures, he observes, “you will
                    gain much more labour from your servants, a great part of whose time was taken
                    up in gathering thistles and other garbage for their horses to feed upon in
                    their stables; and thereby the great trampling and pulling up, and other
                    destruction of the corns, while they are yet tender, will be prevented.”
                    Potatoes and turnips are recommended to be sown in the yard (kitchen-garden).
                    Clover does not seem to have been in use. Rents were paid in corn; and, for the
                    largest farm, which he thinks should employ no more than two ploughs, the rent
                    was about six chalders of victual “when the ground •is very good, and four in
                    that which is not so good. But I am most fully convinced they should take long
                    leases or tacks, that they may not be straitened with time in the improvement of
                    their rooms; and this is profitable both for master and tenant.”</p>
                <p>Such was the state of the husbandry of Scotland in the early part of last
                    century. The first attempts at improvement cannot be traced farther back than
                    1723, when a number of landholders formed themselves into a society, under the
                    title of the <hi rend="italic">Society of Improvers in the Knowledge of
                    Agriculture in Scotland.</hi> The earl of Stair, one of their most active
                    members, is said to have been the first who cultivated turnips in that country.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Select Transactions</hi> of this society were collected
                    and published in 1743 by Mr Maxwell, who took a large part in its proceedings.
                    It is evident from this book that the society had exerted itself in a very
                    laudable manner, and apparently with considerable success, in introducing
                    cultivated herbage and turnips, as well as in improving the former methods of
                    culture. But there is reason to believe that the influence of the example of its
                    numerous members did not extend to the common tenantry, who are always unwilling
                    to adopt the practices of those who are placed in a higher rank, and supposed to
                    cultivate land for pleasure rather than profit. Though this society, the
                    earliest probably in the United Kingdom, soon counted up-wards of 300 members,
                    it existed little more than 20 years. Maxwell delivered lectures on agriculture
                    for one or two sessions at Edinburgh, which, from the specimen he has left,
                    ought to have been encouraged.</p>
                <p>In the introductory paper in Maxwell’s collection, we are told, that “the
                    practice of draining, inclosing, summer fallowing, sowing flax, hemp, rape,
                    turnip and grass seeds, planting cabbages after, and potatoes with, the plough,
                    in fields of great extent, is introduced; and that, according to the general
                    opinion, more corn grows now yearly where it was never known to grow before,
                    these twenty years last past, than perhaps a sixth of all that the kingdom was
                    in use to produce at any time before.”</p>
                <p>In this work we find the. first notice of a threshing-machine; it was invented by
                    Mr Michael Menzies; advocate, who obtained a patent for it. Upon a
                    representation made to the society that it was to be seen working in several
                    places, they appointed two of their number to inspect it; and in their report
                    they say, that one man would be sufficient to manage a machine which would do
                    the work of six. One of the machines was “moved by a great waterwheel and
                    triddles,” and another “by a little wheel of three feet diameter, moved by a
                    small quantity of water.” This machine the society recommended to all gentlemen
                    and farmers.</p>
                <p>The next work is by the same Mr Maxwell, printed in 1757, and entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Practical Husbandman; being a collection of miscellaneous papers
                    on Husbandry, &amp;c.</hi> In this book the greater part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Select Transactions</hi> is republished, with a number of new
                    papers, among which, an <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Husbandry of
                    Scotland,</hi> with a proposal for the improvement of it, is the most valuable.
                    In this he lays it down as a rule, that it is bad husbandry to take two crops of
                    grain successively, which marks a considerable progress in the knowledge of
                    modern husbandry; though he adds, that in Scotland the best husbandmen after a
                    fallow take a crop of wheat; after the wheat, peas; then barley, and then oats;
                    and after that they fallow again. The want of inclosures was still a matter of
                    complaint. The ground continued to be cropped so long as it produced two seeds;
                    the best farmers were contented with four seeds, which was more than the general
                    produce.</p>
                <p>The first act of parliament for collecting tolls on the highway in Scotland was
                    passed in 1750, for repairing the road from Dunglass bridge to Haddington. In
                    ten years after, several acts followed for the counties of Edinburgh and Lanark,
                    and for making the roads between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The benefit which
                    agriculture has derived from good roads, it would not be easy to estimate. The
                    want of them -was one great cause of the slow progress of the art in former
                    times.</p>
                <p>The Revolution in 1688 was the epoch of that system of corn laws to which very
                    great influence has been ascribed, both on the practice of agriculture and the
                    general prosperity of the country. But for an account of these and later
                    statutes on the subject, we must refer to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Corn
                    Laws.</hi></p>
                <p>The exportation of wool was prohibited in 1647, in 1660, and in 1688; and the
                    prohibition strictly enforced by subsequent statutes. The effect of this on its
                    price, and the state of the wool trade,’ from the earliest period to the middle
                    of last century, are distinctly exhibited by the learned and laborious author of
                    <hi rend="italic">Memoirs on Wool,</hi> printed in 1747.</p>
                <p>The gradual advance in the price of land produce soon after the year 1760,
                    occasioned by the increase of population, and of wealth derived from
                    manufactures and commerce, has given a more powerful stimulus to rural industry,
                    augmented agricultural capital in a greater degree, and called forth a more
                    skilful and enterprising race of cultivators, than all the laws for regulating
                    the corn trade could ever have effected. Most of the inventions for increasing
                    produce and economizing labour have either been introduced, or improved and
                    greatly extended, since that time; and by means of both, the free surplus has
                    been vastly increased for the supply of the general consumption. The passing of
                    more than 3000 bills of inclosure, in the late reign, before which the whole
                    number was only 244, is a proof how much more rapidly the cultivation of new
                    land has proceeded than formerly; and the garden-like appearance of the country,
                    as well as the striking improvement in the condition of all classes of the rural
                    population, display, in the most decided manner, the skill and the success with
                    which this great branch of national industry is now followed throughout the
                    greater part of Britain. ' <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi><pb break="no"

                    husbandry, any considerable improvements in the species of crops cultivated, and
                    the order in which they succeed one another, in agricultural machinery, and in
                    the kinds and varieties of live stock, are entitled to hold a very prominent
                    place. Our limits do not permit us to do more than just to notice a few of the
                    most important here; but we shall have occasion to describe them more fully in
                    the second part of this article, when treating on the practice and present state
                    of our agriculture.</p>
                <p>The great line of distinction between the present and the former courses of
                    cropping, consists in the alternation of what are called exhausting and
                    ameliorating crops. The best cultivators rarely take two corn crops in
                    succession; but corn is almost universally succeeded by a leguminous crop, or
                    one of herbage, cut or pastured, or turnips, cabbages, rape, &amp;c.; or, when
                    the soil is not suited to turnips, by a summer fallow, recurring at as distant
                    an interval as its condition will permit. In common language, a green or a pulse
                    crop, or a plain fallow, is interposed between every two white corn crops. These
                    green crops not only preserve the fertility of the soil, but when sown in rows,
                    as most of them usually are, they afford an opportunity of extirpating weeds, by
                    the use of the horse and hand hoe; and even when sown broad-cast, by their
                    taking complete possession of the ground, if it is properly prepared, the growth
                    of weeds is effectually checked. In other respects, these intermediate crops are
                    of the utmost importance in every good course of management. Whether they be
                    eaten on the ground or carried to the farm houses and straw yards, much valuable
                    manure is obtained from their consumption; and on sandy or gravelly soils, when
                    only a part of a turnip crop is eaten by sheep on the ground, the greatest
                    defect of such land is removed by their treading, and in many cases it is
                    rendered capable of producing as valuable a crop of wheat as soils of a closer
                    texture. It is for these reasons that, by the cultivation of clover, and turnips
                    in particular, in regular alternation with corn, the soil is so much enriched as
                    to yield as much corn on the half of any given extent of land as the whole did
                    under the old course of successive crops of corn; and, unless upon strong clays,
                    an unproductive fallow is wholly dispensed with.</p>
                <p>But these crops are not less valuable in another point of view. Before the
                    introduction of clover and turnips, there was nothing for the maintenance of
                    live‘stock but natural herbage in summer, with the addition of hay and straw in
                    winter; and in the northern parts of the island in particular, where the winters
                    are long and severe, it was seldom possible to do more, for about half the year,
                    than preserve cattle and sheep from starving. Even in the most favourable
                    situations, very little butcher-meat could be brought to market from December to
                    June, unless at an expense which the great body of consumers were quite unable
                    to reimburse. The more early maturity of cattle and sheep, and the regular
                    supply of the market throughout the year, are therefore chiefly owing to turnips
                    and clover, as well as the vast increase in the number of the live stock kept on
                    arable land, and the great degree of perfection to which some breeds have been
                    brought by the skilful experiments of several eminent agriculturists.</p>
                <p>Among these, the first place is unquestionably due to Mr Robert Bakewell of
                    Dìshley, in Leicestershire. By his skilful selection at first, and constant care
                    afterwards, to breed from the best animals, he at last obtained a variety of
                    sheep, which, for early maturity, and the property of returning a great produce
                    of mutton for the food they consume, as well as for the small proportion which
                    the weight of the offal bears to that of the four quarters, are altogether
                    unequalled either in this or any other country. The Dishley or new Leicester
                    sheep, and their crosses, are now spread over the principal corn districts of
                    Britain; and, from their quiet domesticated habits, are probably still the most
                    profitable of all the varieties of sheep, on farms where the rearing and
                    fattening of live stock are combined with the best courses of tillage crops.</p>
                <p>The practice of Mr Bakewell and his followers furnishes an instance of the
                    benefits of the division of labour, in a department of business where it was
                    little to be expected. Their males were let out every year to breeders from all
                    parts of England; and thus, by judiciously crossing the old races, all the
                    valuable properties of the Dish-ley variety descended, after three or lour
                    generations, to their posterity. By no other means could this new breed have
                    spread so rapidly, or been made to accommodate itself so easily to a change of
                    climate and pasture. Another recommendation of this plan was, that the ram-hirer
                    had a choice among a number of males of somewhat different properties, and in a
                    more or less advanced stage of improvement, from which it was his business to
                    select such as suited his particular object. These were reared by experienced
                    men, who gave their principal attention to this branch alone; and having the
                    best females as well as males, they were able to furnish the necessary supply of
                    young males in the greatest variety, to those farmers whose time was occupied
                    with other pursuits. The prices at which Mr BakewelΓs rams were hired appear
                    enormous. In 1789 he received twelve hundred guineas for the hire of three
                    brought at one birth; two thousand for seven; and for his whole letting, at
                    least three thousand guineas.</p>
                <p>Merino sheep were first brought into England in 1788, when his late Majesty
                    procured "a small flock by way of Portugal. In 1791 another flock was imported
                    from Spain. In 1804, when the annual sales commenced, this race began to attract
                    much notice. Dr Parry of Bath crossed the Ryeland or Herefordshire sheep with
                    the Merinos, and brought the wool of the fourth generation to a degree of
                    fineness not excelled, it is said, by that of the pure Merino itself; while the
                    carcass, in which the great defect of the Merinos consists, has been much
                    improved. Lord Somerville and many other gentlemen have bestowed much attention
                    on this valuable race, which, however, has not spread itself over the country;
                    and the wool is understood to have deteriorated.</p>
                <p>One of the most valuable plants introduced into cultivation since 1760 is the
                    ruta baga or Swedish turnip, which in a great degree supplies the great
                    desideratum of late spring food for live stock, after the common turnip is
                    generally much damaged, and sometimes almost wholly destroyed, by the severity
                    and changes of the weather. The Scotish yellow turnip is for the same reason a
                    most useful variety, coming in between the white turnips and the Swedish, in
                    some situations supplying the place of the latter, and yielding generally a
                    larger produce. A new variety of oats, called the potato oat, was accidentally
                    discovered in 1788. It comes early, and gives, a large produce both in grain and
                    in meal, on good soils; and was soon cultivated over all the north of England
                    and south of Scotland. But it has already begun to degenerate. A good many
                    varieties of summer wheat have been introduced of late, but they arc only
                    partially cultivated.</p>
                <p>Under the head of agricultural machinery, we need only notice the improvement of
                    the swing-plough by Small, and of the threshing-machine by Meikle; though the
                    latter may rather claim the entire merit of the invention.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033241" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3241-0264"/>
                <p>We shall have Occasion to notice in its proper place the progress that has been
                    made towards perfecting a machine for reaping corn, still an important
                    desideratum.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of Scotland has been benefited by an act in 1770, which relaxed
                    the rigour of strict entails, and extended the powers of proprietors, in so far
                    as regards the improvement of their estates and the granting of leases; but
                    there is still much room for improvement in this branch of our legal polity.</p>
                <p>There is nothing that shows more clearly the rapid progress of agriculture in
                    Britain, than the great number of societies that have been lately formed, one or
                    more in almost every county, for the diffusion of knowledge, and the
                    encouragement of correct operations and beneficial discoveries. We have already
                    noticed the Society of Improvers established in Scotland in 1723. Besides those
                    respectable associations which have for their object the encouragement of arts,
                    manufactures, and commerce generally, several large institutions have been
                    formed, whose chief purpose is the improvement of agriculture. Among these the
                    Bath and West of England Society, established in 1777, and the Highland Society
                    of Scotland, in 1784, hold a conspicuous rank; nor ought we to pass over in
                    silence the labours of the National Board of Agriculture, formed in 1793, but
                    since abolished, which by means of the county-surveys has made us acquainted
                    with the rural affairs of every part of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>A great many excellent works on agriculture, and relative subjects, have been
                    published since 1760; and among these several periodical miscellanies have been
                    favourably received and widely circulated. But as they are comparatively recent,
                    and the best of them well known, it is unnecessary to give any particular
                    account either of their merits or defects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Part</hi> II.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Practice of British Agriculture.</hi></p>
                <p>We come now to our leading object, the present state of British agriculture,
                    especially as it is found in our best cultivated counties. It is not our purpose
                    to exhibit general views of a statistical nature,—such as the extent and produce
                    of our territory, considered under the several divisions of corn-land, pastures,
                    and wastes or tracts still in a state of nature. The proportion which each of
                    these bears to the whole cannot perhaps be fixed with tolerable accuracy at any
                    time, and is continually varying; and with regard to the aggregate produce, we
                    have seen nothing but conjectural estimates, which, as might be expected, differ
                    greatly from one another.</p>
                <p>The first thing which naturally calls for our attention in a treatise on the
                    practice of agriculture is the <hi rend="smallcaps">Soil,</hi> which may be
                    termed the raw material on which the cultivator has to operate, and according to
                    the nature of which his general management as well as his labour in detail must
                    in a great measure be regulated.</p>
                <p>In penetrating the superficial stratum, the first circumstance which presents
                    itself is the different degree of resistance required to be overcome in
                    different situations. Its component parts are found to be more or less cohesive;
                    in some places nearly all of the same consistency, and in others mixed with
                    decayed roots and small stones. The colour is also different, without any
                    perceptible difference in other respects. These are the obvious varieties which
                    occur immediately beneath the surface, or in what is properly called the <hi
                    rend="italic">soil;</hi> but upon going a little deeper, the texture and colour
                    undergo further changes, even in the same situation. A compact, impervious mass,
                    often imbedded with stones, sometimes succeeds to a superficial stratum of the
                    most incohesive materials: elsewhere, the solid and dense surface soil passes,
                    though commonly by slower gradations, into a substratum of an opposite
                    description; and in many parts the rock itself, from which the soil is supposed
                    to have been formed, rises so near the surface as to stop all further
                    progress.</p>
                <p>In addition to these obvious distinctions, it is soon observed that some soils
                    are slow to admit moisture, and do not speedily part with it, but when dried
                    become so indurated as to be reduced to a pulverulent state with great
                    difficulty; while others are so porous as to allow water to pass through them
                    freely, and so open to the influence of the atmosphere, that if it meets with
                    any obstruction from the subsoil, it is very soon carried off by
                    evaporation.</p>
                <p>In the classification of soils with a view to practical utility, therefore, they
                    may be all reduced under two general divisions, according to their texture. The
                    terms stiff, heavy, strong, cohesive, and others of the same import, all denote
                    soils of which the basis or principal ingredient is <hi rend="italic"
                    >clay</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as, on the other hand, those in which sand
                    predominates are called loose, light, porous, friable. Under each of these
                    divisions, however, there are several varieties, such as gravel, loam, chalk,
                    calcareous, alluvial, peaty, &amp;c.; to which are added the common epithets of
                    rich and poor, cold and hot, thin or shallow, and deep, and various others.</p>
                <p>Of the crops best suited to these several kinds of soil, it is only necessary to
                    observe here, that wheat, beans, clovers, and fibrous-rooted plants generally,
                    are most productive on <hi rend="italic">clays;</hi> while barley, turnips, and
                    all bulbous and deep-rooted plants, thrive best in sandy soils. <hi
                    rend="italic">Loam,</hi> which may partake of either character, is an artificial
                    soil, produced by cultivation and manure, and, when sufficiently deep, adapted
                    to crops of every kind. <hi rend="italic">Gravelly soils,</hi> which are usually
                    considered as forming a distinct class, take their character from that of the
                    rocky materials in which they abound. When very loose and porous, they are
                    sometimes called <hi rend="italic">hungry,</hi> the manure applied to them being
                    as it were devoured and lost, from the want of materials in a state to be acted
                    upon; but those of a better quality are not only productive both in corn and
                    pasture, but their crops ripen very early. Calcareous matter, such as lime,
                    chalk, and marl, is a necessary ingredient in all fertile soils, without which,
                    indeed, it has been found impracticable to bring most crops to perfection. The
                    soils formed by matters deposited by the tides and by rivers, called <hi
                    rend="italic">alluvial,</hi> usually consist of a variety of ingredients, and
                    are for the most part very fertile. What is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >mossy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">peaty soil</hi> is distinguished by its dark
                    colour and spongy texture, and abounds in the roots of plants in a state of
                    decay, from which, indeed, it seems to have been wholly formed. It is found in a
                    great variety of situations, on the summits of mountains as well as in plains
                    and hollows; in some cases so saturated with water as not to bear the weight of
                    cattle, in others in so solid a form as to be cut for fuel; sometimes of the
                    depth of many feet, and elsewhere of only a few inches; but in all situations
                    its produce of stunted heath, occasionally intermixed with coarse herbage, is of
                    little or no value. This description of soil, if it deserves the name, is of
                    comparatively recent formation, having been found in several instances
                    superincumbent upon cultivated soils which themselves appear to be alluvial, and
                    consequently not of the earliest class. The terms <hi rend="italic">moor</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">moorish</hi> are applied generally to inferior soils in a
                    state of nature, whatever may be their distinctive character in other
                    respects.</p>
                <p>The quality of soils may sometimes be judged of with tolerable accuracy, by
                    attending to the species of plants which they naturally produce, and observing
                    whether they <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033254" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3254-0265"
                    /><hi rend="italic">grow</hi> close and vigorous, so as to cover the soil
                    completely, or rise feeble and scattered, with unoccupied spaces between. The
                    clovers, for instance, grow freely on calcareous soils, and the common ragwort
                    <hi rend="italic">(senecio</hi><hi rend="italic">Jacoboea)</hi> and the
                    corn-thistle <hi rend="italic">(serratula</hi><hi rend="italic">Arυensis)</hi>
                    usually indicate a fertile soil, whatever be its texture. Science has supplied
                    other tests, for which we may refer to Sir Humphry Davy’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agricultural Chemistry.</hi> One of the simplest methods of ascertaining the
                    presence of calcareous matter in the soil, is to pour upon it any strong acid,
                    with which, if this ingredient abounds, it will effervesce freely. The power of
                    retaining moisture, and, when dry, of absorbing it from the atmosphere, as well
                    as the greater increase of temperature, which under the same circumstances takes
                    place in some soils,—these and various other criteria may be employed to
                    determine their comparative fertility.’ And, what is not unworthy of remark, it
                    is known from experience that the productiveness of the soil, under similar
                    circumstances m other respects, depends in some measure on the dryness or
                    humidity of the climate. In the west of Scotland, for instance, where much more
                    rain falls than in the east, light sandy soils do not suffer so much under a
                    severe course of cropping as they are found to do in the latter situation.</p>
                <p>In describing the practice of agriculture, it may be thought that the process by
                    which lands in a state of nature are first brought into cultivation would be
                    entitled to our earliest consideration, and that we should then proceed to
                    describe the successive operations by which our fields have arrived at their
                    present condition. But a moment’s reflection may convince us that such an
                    arrangement would be inexpedient, if not impracticable, on the present occasion.
                    The original state of much of our cultivated land, which has long since passed
                    away, must have been very different in different situations, and would require a
                    corresponding variety of operations to prepare it for growing corn; and a number
                    of implements, however rude, must have been constructed, even before these
                    operations could be commenced. It is only in an advanced stage of the art, and
                    as a branch of general management, that the culture of wastes can demand our
                    attention; for it is then only that capital and science may enable us to
                    cultivate them with advantage.</p>
                <p>But without pretending to scientific arrangement, we shall content ourselves with
                    bringing together those parts of our subject that have a mutual relation and
                    dependence on one another in practice, and endeavour to present its more
                    important details under the four following chapters.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> we shall treat of what regards the
                    cultivation and products of <hi rend="smallcaps">arable land</hi>; in the <hi
                    rend="italic">second,</hi> of the management of <hi rend="smallcaps">grass
                    lands,</hi> and the improvement of <hi rend="smallcaps">wastes</hi>; in the <hi
                    rend="italic">third,</hi> of agricultural <hi rend="smallcaps">live stock</hi>;
                    and in the <hi rend="italic">fourth,</hi> which will be of a more general kind,
                    lgwe shall endeavour to point out those circumstances which have more
                    particularly contributed to the improvement of agriculture in this country, and
                    those also which seem still to obstruct its further advancement.</p>
                <p>There are, besides the subjects which fall to be treated under these divisions,
                    some others, which certainly form component parts of agricultural science, and
                    to which it will be necessary to advert in this work; but as these subjects are
                    not of equal interest to husbandmen generally, and as they are capable of being
                    treated with advantage in a separate form, we shall reserve them for distinct
                    articles, to be afterwards introduced under their respective heads. Such are the
                    subjects of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dairy,</hi> of <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>We shall endeavour to arrange all the most important details connected with this
                    division of our subject under the following sections :—1. Of implements and
                    machinery: 2. Of farm-buildings: 3. Of fences: 4·. Of tillage: 5. Of fallowing:
                    6. Of the cultivation of the different crops: 7. Of the order of their
                    succession: 8. Of the various substances used as manure, and the modes of
                    applying them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Implements and
                    Machinery.</hi></p>
                <p>The numerous implements of tillage husbandry may be arranged under these six
                    heads ;—such as are employed, 1. in preparing land for semination; 2. in
                    depositing the seed; 3. during the growth of the plants; 4. in reaping and
                    securing the crop; 5. in preparing it for market; and, 6. in the general
                    purposes of a farm. But as the same implement is sometimes used for more than
                    one purpose, it would be of little consequence to adhere strictly to this or any
                    other arrangement. The implements required for rendering land fit for tillage do
                    not belong to this part of the article, and several others that have not yet
                    been brought into general use, or are employed only for particular purposes,
                    shall be noticed under the sections to which they respectively belong.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Ploughs.</hi></p>
                <p>Of ploughs there are a great many different sorts; and, besides the variety of
                    construction occasioned by the difference of soils, and the different purposes
                    for which they are employed even on the same soil, there is a considerable
                    diversity in the form, in districts where both the soil and the mode of culture
                    are nearly alike. The most obvious general distinction among ploughs is, their
                    being constructed with or without wheels: and each of these kinds may be again
                    distinguished by other circumstances ;—such as the form of the mould-board and
                    share; their operation in making one or more furrows at a time; their size; and
                    the depth at which they are calculated to work, as in trench-ploughing. It would
                    neither be of much utility, nor at all consistent with our limits, to describe
                    all the numerous varieties of form. The nature of the operation to be performed,
                    and the rules for constructing ploughs that shall be adapted to the different
                    purposes of the cultivator, have been fully described in a variety of works,

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Swing-plough,</hi> with a feathered sock or share, and a
                    curved mould-board, is almost the only one used in Scotland, and throughout a
                    considerable part of England. The old Scotish plough with a spear sock has been
                    laid aside, except in a few of the least improved counties, where it is still
                    found useful when the soil is encumbered by roots or stones. The swing-plough is
                    drawn with less power than wheel-ploughs, the friction not being so great; and
                    it probably<pb break="no" facs="nls:193033267" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3267-0266"/>
                    admits of greater variations in regard to the breadth and depth of the furrow
                    slice. It is usually drawn by two horses abreast in common tillage; but for
                    ploughing between the rows of the drill culture, a smaller one, drawn by one
                    horse, is commonly employed. A plough of this kind, having a mould-board on each
                    side, is also used, both in forming narrow ridges for turnips and potatoes, and
                    in laying up the earth to the roots of the plants, after the intervals have been
                    cleaned and pulverized by the horse and hand hoe. This plough is sometimes made
                    in such a manner that the mould-board may be shifted from one side to the other
                    when working on hilly grounds; by which means the furrows are all laid in the
                    same direction ;—a mode of construction as old as the days of Fitzherbert, who
                    wrote before the middle of the sixteenth century. This is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">turn-wrest</hi> plough.</p>
                <p>Swing-ploughs, similar to the present, have been long known in England. In
                    Blythe’s <hi rend="italic">Improver Improved</hi> (edit. 1652), we have
                    engravings of several ploughs; and what he calls the “plain plough” does not
                    seem to differ much in its principal parts from the one now in use. Amos, in an
                    Essay on <hi rend="italic">Agricultural Machines,</hi> says that a person named
                    Lummis (whom he is mistaken in calling a Scotchman, see Maxwell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Practical Husbandman,</hi> p. 191.) “first attempted its
                    construction upon mathematical principles, which he learned in Holland; but
                    having obtained a patent for the making and vending of this plough, he withheld
                    the knowledge of these principles from the public. However, one Pashley,
                    plough-wright to Sir Charles Turner of Kirkleatham, having a knowledge of those
                    principles, constructed upon them a vast number of ploughs. Afterwards his son
                    established a manufactory for the making of them at Rotherham. Hence they
                    obtained the name of the Rotherham plough; but in Scotland they were called the
                    Dutch or patent plough.”—“At length the Americans, having obtained a knowledge
                    of those principles, either from Britain or Holland, claimed the priority of the
                    invention; in consequence of which, Mr Jefferson, president of the United
                    States, presented the principles for the construction of a mould-board, first to
                    the Institute of France, and next to the Board of Agriculture in England, as a
                    wonderful discovery in mathematics.” <hi rend="italic">( Communications to the
                    Board of Agriculture,</hi> vol. vi. n. 437.)</p>
                <p>According to another writer, the Rotherham plough was first constructed in
                    Yorkshire in 1720, about ten years before Lummis’s improvements. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Survey of the West Biding of Yorkshire.')</hi></p>
                <p>But the present improved swing-plough was little known in Scotland till about the
                    year 1764, when Small’s method of constructing it began to exite attention. This
                    ingenious mechanic formed the mould-board upon distinct and intelligible
                    principles, and afterwards made it of cast-iron. His appendage of a chain has
                    been since laid aside. It has been disputed whether he took the Rotherham or the
                    old Scotish plough for the basis of his improvements. The swing-plough has been
                    since varied a little from Small’s form, for the purpose of adapting it more
                    completely to particular situations and circumstances. Of late it has been made
                    entirely of iron. See Plate V.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wheel-ploughs,</hi> used in many parts of England, are also
                    constructed in a great variety of forms. Their chief recommendation is, that
                    they require less skill in the ploughman; but it is admitted, that the friction
                    caused by the wheels adds to the resistance, and that they are more expensive,
                    and more liable to be put out of order, as well as to be disturbed in their
                    progress by clods, stones, and other inequalities, than those of the swing kind.
                    Wheel-ploughs, says Dr Dickson <hi rend="italic">(Practical Agriculture,</hi>
                    vol. i. p. 7j, should be seldom had recourse to by the experienced ploughman,
                    though they maybe more convenient and more manageable for those who are not
                    perfectly informed in that important and useful art.</p>
                <p>The Hertfordshire and Kentish <hi rend="italic">turn-wrest</hi> wheel-plough, as
                    well as the swing-plough, are described by Blythe; and they do not seem to have
                    received much improvement since his time. The former is thought most suitable
                    for general purposes on stiff tenacious soils, and the latter where very deep
                    ploughing is required.</p>
                <p>On light, loamy, and friable soils, where deep ploughing is not necessary, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Norfolk wheel-plough</hi> will be found convenient and useful:
                    it is compact and light in its form, doing its work with neatness, and requiring
                    only a small power of draught.</p>
                <p>To the improved common wheel-plough an iron earthboard, firmly screwed to the
                    coulter, has been lately added. It is made use of when ploughing turf, which it
                    takes off by itself, and turns into the furrow, immediately covering it with
                    earth. It is observed that, by this management, turf at one ploughing has the
                    appearance of a fallow, and harrows nearly as well; but more strength is
                    required in the team. A similar sort of skim coulter may be added to any other
                    plough, and may be useful in turning down green crops and long dung, as well as
                    in trench-ploughing. But in most instances it is thought a preferable plan,
                    where the soil has to be stirred to an unusual depth, to make two common
                    swing-ploughs follow each other in the same track; the one before taking a
                    shallow furrow, and the other going deeper, and throwing up a new furrow upon
                    the former.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Two-furrow ploughs</hi> are used in a few places, but are not
                    likely ever to become general. They arc constructed either with or without
                    wheels. A plough of this kind was strongly recommended by Lord Somerville, and
                    used by his lordship and others, apparently with some advantages. In Blythe’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Improver Improved,</hi> there is an engraving of this plough
                    also. But with all the improvements made by Lord Somerville, it can never come
                    into competition for general purposes with the present single furrow ploughs;
                    and he admits that it would be no object to invade the system already
                    established in well-cultivated counties; though, where large teams are employed,
                    with a driver besides the ploughman, it would certainly be a matter of
                    importance to use this plough, at least on light friable soils. “Their horses,”
                    he says, “will not feel the difference between their own single furrow working
                    one acre, or the well-constructed two-furrow plough with two acres per day; here
                    is no system deranged, and double work done.” <hi rend="italic">( Communications
                    to the Board of Agriculture,</hi> vol. ii. p. 418.)</p>
                <p>Amos, already mentioned, has gone much beyond this. In his Essay in the Board’s
                    Communications formerly referred to, he gives a description, with an engraving,
                    of a machine which combines “two, three, or four ploughs together, for ploughing
                    furrows nine by five inches square." On soils of a tenacity next to clay, “six
                    horses will draw four ploughs, four horses three ploughs, and three horses two
                    ploughs, and every plough to plough an acre a day." It is scarcely necessary to
                    add, that such machines are altogether unfit for agricultural operations; the
                    nature and condition of the soil and surface, varied in ways innumerable, will
                    never permit the general use of them; and even in the few situations where they
                    may be employed, there is reason to believe that ploughing cannot be done
                    cheaper, and certainly not so well as by the two-horse single furrow plough.</p>
                <p>Various other implements under the name of ploughs have been constructed for
                    stirring the soil ;—such as the <hi rend="italic">Miner,</hi> for following in
                    the furrow of a common plough, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033280"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3280-0267"/>and loosening the ground to a greater depth,
                    without bringing up the subsoil; the <hi rend="italic">Paring Plough;</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mole</hi> and other sorts of ploughs for draining, some of
                    which shall be afterwards noticed under their proper heads.</p>
                <p>A plough has been recently constructed by Mr John Finlayson, farmer at Muirkirk,
                    which is found well adapted to coarse old swards. It is called the rid or
                    self-cleaning plough, from its clearing itself from obstructions without often
                    requiring the aid of the ploughman; and it turns over the furrow in a complete
                    and workman-like manner in situations where it falls back after the common
                    plough, notwithstanding the utmost exertions of the ploughman. It has been tried
                    in various situations both in England and Scotland, and given much satisfaction
                    to very competent judges; but it does not seem to possess any advantages over
                    the common plough upon land under a regular course of cultivation. See Plate
                    VI.</p>
                <p>Several inventions are in use for ascertaining and comparing the power required
                    to work the plough in different situations. These are known by the name of
                    dynamometers, or draught machines; and they all agree in this, that the power is
                    determined by a movable index pointing to figures denoting hundredweights on a
                    dial-plate. The difference in the power necessary even upon the same soil,
                    according to the construction of the plough, is greater than might be expected,
                    varying upon cultivated land free from obstructions from three to five
                    hundredweights and upwards. See Plate IX. <hi rend="italic">(Prize Essays and
                    Transactions of the Highland Society of Scotland,</hi> vol. iv.)</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Cultivator and Grubber.</hi></p>
                <p>The plough, as is well known, covers the old and exposes a new surface; but as
                    that is not always necessary, other implements are in use for stirring and
                    pulverizing the soil without turning it over. Some of them are used in preparing
                    it for the seed, and others, as horse-hoes, between drilled crops. It were to no
                    purpose to enumerate and describe all these; we shall here notice only such as
                    we know to be of practical utility. One of them, called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >grubber,</hi> from its efficiency in bringing weed-roots to the surface,
                    consists of two strong rectangular frames, the one including the other, and nine
                    bars mortised into the inner one, with eleven coulters or tines with triangular
                    sharp-edged dipping feet, four cast-iron wheels, two handles, &amp;c. See Plate
                    V. All the coulters are fixed in these bars except two, which are placed in the
                    side beams of die outer frame, and may be set to go more or less deep by means
                    of pins and wedges. It is useful in stirring land on which potatoes or turnips
                    have grown, or that has been ploughed in autumn or during winter, so that a crop
                    may be sown in spring without further use of the plough. It works as deep as the
                    plough has gone, and, by the reclined position of the coulters, brings to the
                    surface all the weed-roots that lurk in the soil. Beans and peas have been sown
                    in spring on the winter furrow, after being stirred by die grubber; and barley
                    also, after turnip, without any ploughing at all. In working fallow it is used
                    with good effect in saving one, two, or more ploughings. This implement is made
                    of different sizes, and may be worked either by four or by two horses.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>&gt; In a work recently
                    published by General Beatson, a small kind of hoe has been much recommended,
                    which produces the required effect by successive operations, .going at first
                    shallow, and then deeper and deeper, as may be found necessary, or as the soil
                    will permit.</p></note></p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Harrows.</hi></p>
                <p>The harrows most generally used are of an oblong shape, each containing twenty
                    tines, five or six inches long beneath the <hi rend="italic">bulls</hi> or bars
                    in which they are inserted. It is still common for every harrow to work
                    separately; and though always two, and sometimes three harrows are placed
                    together, each of them is drawn by its own horse. The great objection to this
                    method is, that it is scarcely possible, especially upon rough ground, to
                    prevent the harrows from starting out of their place, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >riding</hi> on one another. To obviate this inconvenience, the exterior bulls
                    of each are usually surmounted by a frame of wood, raised so high as to protect
                    it from the irregular motions of its neighbour; but in many instances they are
                    connected by chains, or hinges, or cross bars, which is a preferable plan.
                    Another objection which has been made to the common harrows is, that the ruts
                    made by the tines are sometimes too near and sometimes too distant from one
                    another; but this is probably not a great fault when the soil requires to be
                    pulverized as well as the seed covered, especially when they are permitted to
                    move irregularly in a lateral direction. Where the soil is already fine, as it
                    ought always to be before grass seeds are sown, lighter harrows are used, which
                    are so constructed, that all the ruts are equidistant. See Plate V.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">brake,</hi> as commonly constructed, is nothing more than a
                    heavier haιτow, sometimes in one, and sometimes in two pieces joined together;
                    the tines being in number and length, and in the distance from one another at
                    which they are placed, suited to the nature of the soil on which it is
                    employed.</p>
                <p>Within these few years, two harrows have been brought into use, which seem to be
                    most efficient implements, especially where the soil abounds in weed-roots. The
                    first of them is the invention of Mr Samuel Morton, agricultural implement
                    maker, Edinburgh, and is called the <hi rend="italic">Revolving Brake
                    Harrow.</hi> When the soil has been sufficiently reduced, this is perhaps the
                    best implement of any for bringing the roots to the surface; and to a certain
                    extent it also acts in pulverizing the land when under fallow, so as to save one
                    or two ploughings. See Plate VI. <hi rend="italic">(Farmer s Magazine,</hi> vol.
                    xviii. &amp;c.)</p>
                <p>The other has been constructed by Mr Finlayson, the inventor of the self-cleaning
                    plough already mentioned; and is also a very powerful implement. See Plate

                <p>The purpose of these ingenious but often too complicated machines is, to deposit
                    the seed in equidistant rows on a flat surface; on the top of a narrow ridge; in
                    the interval between two ridges; or in the bottom of a common furrow. Corn when
                    drilled is usually sown in the first of these ways, turnips in the second, and
                    peas and beans in the third or fourth. One of the best for sowing all kinds of
                    corn was invented by Mr Bailey of Chillingham,<note anchored="true"

                    agricultural implements, and applied to their improvement his knowledge both as
                    a mathematician and agriculturist. The practice of drilling corn does not,
                    however, seem to be gaining ground; and even where it is found of advantage to
                    have the plants rise in parallel rows, as must always be the case where
                    hand-hoeing is required, this is sometimes done by means of what is called <hi
                    rend="italic">ribbing,</hi> a process which will be afterwards described, as
                    more convenient in many cases than sowing with a drill-machine.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033293" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3293-0268"/>
                <p>In Scotland, turnips are universally sown with a drill-machinc, on ridges 27 or
                    30 inches broad, usually formed by one <hi rend="italic">bout</hi> of a common
                    plough. When turnips are extensively grown, the machine is made to sow two of
                    these ridges at once, and two rollers are attached to it, one for smoothing the
                    tops of the ridges before the seed is deposited, and the other for compressing
                    the soil and covering the seed. The front roller is now made concave, which
                    leaves the ridges in a better form for the seed. It is drawn by one horse
                    walking between the ridges, and requiring no other driver than the person who
                    guides the machine, which is simple in its construction, and most expeditious in
                    its operation. Sec Plate VII.</p>
                <p>Beans and peas, when sown in rows, are either deposited in the space between two
                    ridgelets, which are afterwards reversed to cover them, or in the bottom of a
                    furrow made by a common plough,—in Scotland, usually in that of every third
                    furrow. The implement in most common use for this purpose is extremely simple,
                    and is either wheeled forward by a man, or attached to the common plough
                    itself.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Horse-Hoes.</hi></p>
                <p>The interval between the rows of drilled turnips, potatoes, and beans and peas,
                    being commonly from 2 to 2½ feet, admits the employment of a horse-hoe or
                    hoeing-plough. Of this kind of machine there are a great many varieties. A very
                    good one is described in the Northumberland Report, p. 43; the body is of a
                    triangular form, and contains three coulters and three hoes, or six hoes,
                    according to the state of the soil. A hoe of the same kind is sometimes attached
                    to a small roller, and employed between rows of wheat and barley, from 9 to 12
                    inches distant; it is also used in place of a cultivator, in preparing bean
                    stubbles for wheat in autumn, and in pulverizing lands for barley in spring.</p>
                <p>Another implement, which serves both as a double mould-board plough and a
                    horse-hoc, is much approved of in the culture of drilled crops; and with some
                    slight alterations it may be also employed as a small plough for taking the
                    earth from the sides of the ridgelets. When it is used as a horse-hoe, the
                    mould-boards are taken off, and two curved cutters or coulters expand from the
                    beam on each side, to a less or greater distance, according to the width of the
                    interval between the plants, and approach each other in the bottom of the
                    furrow, where the share supplies their place. This machine is well adapted for
                    light soils, and can be set to work very near the rows of plants; it is
                    particularly useful in cutting up annual weeds preparatory to hand-hoeing, which
                    it greatly facilitates. When it is to be employed as a single or double
                    mould-board plough, the cutters are withdrawn. A very complete implement,
                    answering these different purposes, is known under the name of Morton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Universal Drill-Plough and Harrow,</hi> which is found very
                    convenient in the hands of skilful ploughmen, and seems well suited for the use
                    of small farms, or situations where a variety of implements is not often
                    required; so many of these being combined in one, and admitting of being easily
                    separated and used each by itself. See Plate VII.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Rollers.</hi></p>
                <p>These are constructed of wood, stone, or cast-iron, and of different dimensions,
                    according to the purposes for which they are used. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >spike-roller</hi> is employed in some places when the soil rises in large
                    masses, difficult to be reduced. The Norfolk <hi rend="italic"
                    >drill-roller,</hi> on which rings of iron are fixed at small distances, is
                    considered a useful implement, as, by forming parallel ruts into which the seed
                    falls, with small ridges between, the seed is better covered than by harrowing
                    alone. But rollers are chiefly used for the purpose of smoothing and compressing
                    the soil and breaking down clods; and their weight is varied accordingly. See
                    Plate VII.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Horse-Rakes.</hi></p>
                <p>In those districts where corn is cut with the scythe, the horse-rake is found to
                    be a useful implement for saving manual labour; it is also used for hay. The
                    teeth are of iron, 14 or 15 inches in length, and set five or six inches
                    distant. Its construction is very simple. A man and horse are said to be capable
                    of clearing from 20 to 30 acres in a moderate day’s work, disposing the grain in
                    lines across the field, by lifting up the rake and dropping it from the teeth,
                    without stopping the horse. One of these has been lately used in the
                    neighbourhood of Edinburgh for raking hay, and has given much satisfaction. See
                    Plate VI.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Threshing-Machines.</hi></p>
                <p>Threshing-machines are now common in every part of Scotland, on farms where the
                    extent of tillage land requires two or more ploughs; and they are every year
                    spreading more and more in England and Ireland. They are worked by horses,
                    water, wind, and of late by steam; and their powers and dimensions are adapted
                    to the various sizes of farms. Water is by far the best power; but as a supply
                    cannot be obtained in many situations, and as wind and steam require too much
                    expense for most farms, horses arc still employed more generally than any other
                    power. Where wind-mills are erected, it is found necessary to add such machinery
                    as may allow them to be worked by horses occasionally, in very calm weather; and
                    the use of steam must be confined·for the most part to the coal districts.</p>
                <p>All the essential parts of this machine will be noticed in describing the
                    engraving (Plate IX.), though several slight alterations are occasionally
                    introduced. One of the most useful of these, perhaps, is the method of
                    delivering the straw, after it has been separated from the corn by the circular
                    rake, to what is called a <hi rend="italic">travellingshaker,</hi> which carries
                    it to the straw-l⅛arn. This shaker, which revolves like the endless web formerly
                    used for conveying the corn to the beaters, is composed of small rods, placed so
                    near as to prevent the straw from falling through, while any threshed corn that
                    may not have been formerly separated drops from it in its progress, instead of
                    falling along with it, where it would be trodden down and lost.</p>
                <p>It is well known that the work of horses at threshingmills is unusually severe,
                    if continued for any length of time; that they sometimes draw unequally; that
                    they, as well as the machine itself, are much injured by sudden jerks and
                    strains, which are almost unavoidable; and that, from this irregularity in the
                    impelling power, it requires much care in the man who presents the corn to the
                    rollers, to prevent bad threshing. It is therefore highly desirable that the
                    labour should be equalized among the horses, and the movements of the machine
                    rendered as steady as possible. A method of yoking the horses in such a manner
                    as compels each of them to take his proper share of the labour has accordingly
                    been lately introduced, and the necessary apparatus, which is neither
                    complicated nor expensive, can be added to any machine worked by animal power.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Farmers Magazine,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 279.) See Plate IX.</p>
                <p>All well-constructed threshing-mills have one winnowing-machine, which separates
                    the chaff from the corn be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033306"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3306-0269"/>fore it reaches the ground; and a second sometimes
                    receives it from the first, and gives it out ready for market, or nearly so; the
                    work done varying with the power and the kind of grain from three to six or
                    eight quarters in the hour. If the height of the building does not admit of this
                    last addition, a separate winnowing-machine, when the mill is of great power, is
                    driven by a belt from it. In either of these ways there is a considerable saving
                    of manual labour. And with a powerful water-mill, it cannot be doubted that corn
                    is threshed and dressed at no more expense than must be incurred for dressing
                    alone when threshed with the flail. Besides, the corn is more completely
                    detached from the straw; and, by being threshed expeditiously, a good deal of it
                    may be preserved in a bad season which would have spoiled in a stack. The great
                    advantage of transferring forty or fifty quarters of grain in a few hours, and
                    under the eye of the owner, from the yard to the granary or market, is of itself
                    sufficient to recommend this invaluable machine, even though there were no
                    saving of expense.</p>
                <p>A machine of this kind, which is worked by one or two men, may probably be found
                    useful on small farms. It is made for L.8 or L.10, and is said to thresh ten or
                    twelve bushels in an hour. (<hi rend="italic">Id.</hi> p. 409.) In some parts,
                    of England portable machines are in use, and carried from one farm to another,
                    like any common implement.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Winnowing-Machine.</hi></p>
                <p>This is said to be of Chinese invention, and to have been brought to Europe by
                    the Dutch, from whom it reached Scotland in the early part of the last century.
                    They were first made by a person of the name of Rodgers, near Hawick, in
                    Roxburghshire, who happened to see one in a granary at Leith in the year 1733,
                    though it would appear that one had been brought from Holland to East Lothian,
                    along with a barley-mill, twenty-two years before. Yet it does not seem to have
                    been then known to farmers, nor did it come into general use till long after
                    1733; and in some parts of England and of the north of Scotland it is not
                    employed even at this day. Two men and three women will dress and measure up
                    into sacks, in about ten hours, from twenty to twenty-five quarters of corn, by
                    means of this machine.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Chaff-Cutter, and similar Implements.</hi></p>
                <p>Chaff-cutters may be either wrought separately by manual labour, or by being
                    attached to some other machine. This implement, like the operation it performs,
                    is sufficiently simple, though its construction is various. MacdougaΓs patent
                    chaff-cutter is understood to be one of the most useful of the kind, and may be
                    easily repaired, when necessary, by any common mechanic. Another tool of a
                    similar description is partially used for cutting turnips, which is often an
                    advantageous practice, especially in feeding sheep of a year old in spring,
                    after they have cast their first teeth. Various contrivances are also adopted by
                    some farmers for cutting or bruising corn for horses, which ought to become a
                    more general practice, particularly for old horses, and such as swallow their
                    corn without mastication. Akin to these inventions is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >steaming apparatus,</hi> which should be considered a necessary appendage to
                    every arable and dairy farm of a moderate size. The advantages of preparing food
                    for live stock by means of steam begin now to be generally and justly
                    appreciated.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Wheel-Carriages.</hi><hi rend="italic">Waggons,</hi> though
                    they may possess some advantages over carts in long journeys, and when fully
                    loaded, are now admitted to be much less convenient for the general purposes of
                    a farm, and particularly on occasions which require great dispatch, as in
                    harvesting the crop. According to Marshall, the waggons used in Gloucestershire
                    are the best in England, <hi rend="italic">(Rural Economy of
                    Gloucestershire.')</hi> In some places the <hi rend="italic">improved Irish
                    car</hi> is employ-, ed for light loads, while the waggon continues to be used
                    for other purposes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carts,</hi> drawn by one or two horses, are, however, the only
                    farm-carriages of some of the best cultivated counties, and no other are ever
                    used in Scotland. Their load depends upon the strength of the horses and nature
                    of the roads; but in every case, it is asserted that a given number of horses
                    will draw a great deal more, according to some one-third more, in single-horse
                    carts than in waggons. Two-horse carts are still the most common among farmers
                    in Scotland; but those drawn by one horse, two of which are always driven by one
                    man, are unquestionably preferable for most purposes. The carriers of the west
                    of Scotland usually load from a ton to a ton and a half on a single-horse cart,
                    and nowhere does it carry less than 12 cwts. if the roads are tolerable.</p>
                <p>For corn in the straw, and hay, the farmers of the south of Scotland and north of
                    England use a sparred frame, which is made to fit the same wheels from which the
                    close body of the cart is removed. In other places the close body is retained,
                    and movable rails attached to it for these loads. See Plate VI.</p>
                <p>Carts are varied in their construction to suit different purposes. A very
                    convenient carriage for home work, called a <hi rend="italic">coup-cart,</hi>
                    discharges its load with great ease and expedition; the fore part of the close
                    body being made to rise up from the shafts on drawing out an iron pin, while the
                    other end sinks, and allows the load to fall to the ground.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Broad wheels,</hi> with conical or convex rims, are common in
                    England; in Scotland the wheels are generally narrow, though broader ones are
                    beginning to be introduced. Those used for the common or two-horse carts are
                    usually about 4½ feet high, and mounted on iron axles. The advantages of broad
                    cylindrical wheels have been illustrated with much force and ingenuity in
                    several late publications. <hi rend="italic">( Communications to the Board of

                <p>An implement capable of performing the process of reaping corn is yet a <hi
                    rend="italic">desideratum</hi> in agricultural machinery, but which will
                    probably be supplied, at least for favourable situations, at no distant period.
                    In all field operations, dispatch, in such a climate as this, is a matter of
                    great importance; but in reaping corn at the precise period of its maturity, the
                    advantages of dispatch are incalculable, especially in those districts where the
                    difficulty of procuring hands, even at enormous wages, aggravates the danger
                    from the instability of the season. It cannot, therefore, fail to be
                    interesting, and we hope it may be also useful, to record some of the more
                    remarkable attempts that have been made towards an invention so eminently
                    calculated to forward this most important operation.</p>
                <p>The first attempt of this kind, so far as we have learned, was made by a Mr
                    Boyce, who obtained a patent for a reaping-machine about 30 years ago. This
                    machine was placed in a two-wheeled carriage, somewhat resembling a common cart,
                    but the wheels were fixed upon the axle, so that it revolved along with them. A
                    cog-wheel within the carriage turned a smaller one at the upper end of an
                    inclined axis, and at the lower end of this was a larger wheel, which gave a
                    rapid motion to a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033319"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3319-0270"/>pinion fixed upon a vertical axis in the fore part
                    of the carriage, and rather on one side, so that it went before one of the
                    wheels of the carriage. The vertical spindle descended to within a few inches of
                    the surface of the ground, and had there a number of scythes fixed upon it
                    horizontally.</p>
                <p>This machine, when wheeled along, would, by the rapid revolution of its scythes,
                    cut down a portion of the corn growing upon the grdund over which it passed; but
                    having no provision for gathering up the corn in parcels and laying it in proper
                    heaps, it was wholly unfit for the purpose.</p>
                <p>An agricultural implement maker of London, Mr Pluck-net, attempted some years
                    afterwards to improve this machine. The principal alteration he made was in
                    substituting for the scythes a circular steel plate, made very sharp at the
                    edge, and notched on the upper side like a sickle. This plate acted in the same
                    manner as a very fine-toothed saw, and was found to cut the corn much better
                    than the scythes of the original machine.</p>
                <p>A description and drawing of a machine, invented by Mr Gladstones of Castle
                    Douglas, in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, are given in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Farmer’s Magazine,</hi> vol. vii. p. 273. It operated upon nearly the same
                    principles with Mr Plucknet’s; but Mr Gladstones made it work much better by
                    introducing a circulai· table, with strong wooden teeth notched below all
                    around, which was fixed immediately over the cutter, and parallel to it. The use
                    of these teeth was to collect the corn and retain it till it was operated on by
                    the circular cutter. The corn when cut was received upon this table, and, when a
                    sufficient quantity was collected, taken away by a rake or sweeper, and laid
                    upon the ground beneath the machine, in separate parcels. To this machine was
                    added a small circular wheel of wood covered with emery, which, being always in
                    contact with the great cutter at the back part, or opposite side to that where
                    the cutting was performed, kept it constantly ground to a sharp edge.</p>
                <p>The next attempt was made by Mr Robert Salmon of Woburn, Bedfordshire, whose
                    invention, it is said, promised better than those we have mentioned. It was
                    constructed upon a totally different principle, as it cut the corn by means of
                    shears; and it was provided with a very complete apparatus for laying it down in
                    parcels as it was cut.</p>
                <p>One of the most promising machines of this kind of which we have received any
                    account, was constructed by Mr Smith, of the Deanston Cotton Works, Perthshire.
                    He made the first trial of it upon a small scale, during the harvest of 1811. It
                    was then wrought by two men. In 1812 he constructed one upon a larger scale, to
                    be wrought by a horse; but though he cut down several acres of oats and barley
                    with considerable ease, it was found that, when met by an acclivity, the horse
                    could not move the machine with proper effect. In 1813 he made a more successful
                    attempt with an improved machine, worked by one man and two horses; and in 1814
                    it was still further improved by an additional apparatus, tending to regulate
                    the application of the <hi rend="italic">cutter</hi> when working on an uneven
                    surface.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cutter</hi> of this machine is circular, and operates
                    horizontally; it is appended to a drum connected with the fore part of the
                    machine, its blade projecting some inches beyond the periphery of the lower end
                    of the drum (See Plate VIII.); and the machine is so constructed as to
                    communicate, in moving forward, a rapid rotatory motion to this drum and cutter,
                    by which the stalks are cut, and, falling upon the drum, are carried round and
                    thrown off in regular rows. This ingenious piece of machinery will cut about an
                    English acre per hour, during which time the cutter requires to be four times
                    sharpened with a common scythe-stone. The expense is estimated at from L.30 to
                    L.35. If properly managed, it may last for many years, only requiring a new <hi
                    rend="italic">cutter</hi> every two or three years; a repair which cannot cost
                    much. But we are sorry to learn that, after some not unsatisfactory trials, Mr
                    Smith has not found it convenient to prosecute his invention.</p>
                <p>A more recent attempt has been lately made by Mr Patrick Bell, A. Μ. His machine
                    was tried at Gowrie, in the county of Forfar, in the month of September 1829, in
                    outting down oats, barley, and wheat, on ground of uneven surface and
                    considerable declivity. It is about five feet broad, and consequently cuts down
                    this breadth of corn as it moves onward. The stubble left was from three to four
                    inches high; and the cut corn was deposited as the machine advanced, in a very
                    regular manner. It was worked by one horse, and may cost about L.30, the work
                    done being at about the rate of an imperial acre in the hour. In the opinion of
                    the farmers and others present at this trial, this machine will come immediately
                    into general use, and confer a signal benefit on agriculture. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Flemish or Hainault scythe has been tried at different times, and recommended
                    as a better implement for reaping corn than the sickle or scythe in common use;
                    and it was lately brought fully before the public, under the patronage of the
                    Highland Society of Scotland. At the request of this society, Μ. Masclet, late
                    French consul at Edinburgh, brought over two young men from Flanders to show the
                    use of this implement, and to instruct our own labourers. The trials were made,
                    after public notice, in several parts of Scotland, with the different varieties
                    of grain, and under different circumstances as to the state of the crop at the
                    time; and the results seem to be very much in its favour. The straw was cut
                    nearly as close as with the common scythe, taken up clean except where the crop
                    was very thin, and laid down regularly in a proper state for binding and
                    threshing. A man will cut with this implement two roods or half an acre a day;
                    and the saving has been calculated as equal to about one-third of what would be
                    required to cut the same crop by the sickle now in use. See Plate VI.</p>
                <p>Still, however, the most common implement for reaping is either the teethed hook
                    or the smooth sickle, sometimes called the scythe-hook. It has been disputed
                    which of these is preferable. The sickle cuts the straw like a scythe, and where
                    the crops are strong, there can be no doubt that the work is performed with much
                    less labour, and the crop taken up equally clean as by the teethed hook. But
                    where the crop is thin and straggling, some of the stalks drop to the ground as
                    they are cut, instead of being gathered and taken up, as they would have been by
                    the teethed hook.</p>
                <p>We have thus noticed all the most important implements in general use, and shall
                    have occasion, under the proper heads, to advert to some others that are only
                    employed occasionally. Our limits require us to pass over those of a more simple
                    kind, which are well known, and may be found fully described in a variety of
                    pûblications. (See <hi rend="italic">Communications to the Board of
                    Agriculture,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">County Reports,</hi> and the <hi

                    II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Farm-Houses.</hi></p>
                <p>Suitable farm-buildings are scarcely less necessary to the husbandman than
                    implements and machinery, and might, without much impropriety, be classed along
                    with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033332" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3332-0271"/>them, and
                    considered as one great stationary machine, operating more or less on every
                    branch of labour and produce. There is nothing which marks more decidedly the
                    state of agriculture in any district than the plan and execution of these
                    buildings.</p>
                <p>In erecting farm-houses, the first thing that deserves notice is their situation,
                    both in regard to the other parts of the farm, and the convenience which they
                    ought themselves to possess. In general, it must be of importance on arable
                    farms, that the buildings should be set down at nearly an equal distance from
                    the extremities; or so situate that the access from all the different fields
                    should be easy, and the distance from those most remote no greater than the size
                    of the farm renders unavoidable. The advantages of such a position in saving
                    labour are too obvious to require illustration; and yet this matter is not
                    nearly so much attended to as its importance deserves. In some cases, however,
                    it is advisable to depart from this general rule, of which one of the most
                    obvious is, when a command of water for a threshing-mill and other purposes can
                    be better secured in another quarter of the farm.</p>
                <p>The form most generally approved for a set of offices is that of a square, or
                    rather a rectangular parallelogram, the houses being arranged on the north,
                    east, and west sides, and the south side fenced by a stone wall, to which low
                    buildings for calves, pigs, &amp;c. are sometimes attached. The space thus
                    inclosed is usually allotted to young cattle: these have access to the sheds on
                    one or two sides, and are kept separate, according to their size or age, by one
                    or more partition-walls. The farmer’s dwelling-house stands at a short distance
                    from the offices, and frequently commands a view of the inside of the square;
                    and cottages for servants and labourers are placed on some convenient spot, not
                    far from the other buildings.</p>
                <p>The number and arrangement, as well as the size of the different houses, must
                    depend in some degree on the extent of the farm and the general management. It
                    is therefore only necessary to notice particularly those which are indispensable
                    in every case on an arable farm, and the degree of accommodation they should
                    afford.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">barn</hi> is always set down so as to be as convenient as
                    possible for the stack-yard, wherever corn is put up in stacks instead of being
                    immediately carried from the field to the barn itself. Relatively to the other
                    buildings, its situation may be varied according to circumstances; but two
                    things should be-attended to; first, its contiguity to the granary; and, second,
                    its facility of access for furnishing straw to the cattle-houses. In the plan
                    delineated in Plate VI., it is placed in the middle of the north range, with one
                    end projecting into the stack-yard, and the other, where the straw is lodged, on
                    a line with stables on one side, and cattle-houses on the other, and having a
                    door opening towards the straw-yards. As it is to be understood throughout this
                    description that a threshing-mill is employed, a width of from 20 to 30 feet
                    within walls, on the length of this side of the square, will generally be
                    sufficient for the straw-house. The height of the barn must be such as to allow
                    at least one winnowing-machine to be attached to the mill, and its length is
                    determined by the size of the farm.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">granary</hi> is an indispensable accommodation on all
                    tolerably large farms, and is commonly, though in many cases improperly, placed
                    above the cart-sheds, to be afterwards noticed. From experience and observation,
                    we would recommend that the granary should be under the roof of the bam,
                    immediately above the floor on which the machine works; and that the corn should
                    be raised to it from the ground-floor either by the threshing-mill itself, or a
                    common windlass, easily worked by one man. When it is to be taken out and
                    carried to market, it may be lowered down upon carts, with the utmost facility
                    and dispatch. There is evidently no greater expense incurred by this
                    arrangement, for the same floor and height of side-walls that must be added to
                    the barn are required in whatever situation the granary may be, and it possesses
                    several advantages. Owing to its being higher than the adjacent buildings, there
                    is a freer circulation of air, and less danger of pilfering, or of destruction
                    by vermin; the corn can be deposited in it as it is dressed, without being
                    exposed to the weather; while the saving of labour is in most cases
                    considerable. This plan has been lately recommended by several agricultural
                    writers,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dickson’s
                    Practical Agriculture, vol. i. p. 48; and General Report of the Agricultural
                    State of Scotland, vol. i. p. 141.</p></note> and has been found exceedingly
                    convenient in practice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stables</hi> are now constructed in such a manner that all the
                    horses stand in a line with their heads towards the same side-wall, instead of
                    standing in two lines, fronting opposite walls, as formerly. Those lately
                    erected are at least sixteen feet wide within walls, and sometimes eighteen, and
                    the width of each stall upon the length of the stable is commonly five feet. To
                    save a little room, stalls of nine feet are sometimes made to hold two horses;
                    and in that case the manger and the width of the stall are divided into equal
                    parts by what is called a half-tre-vice, or a partition about half the depth of
                    that which separates one stall from another. By this contrivance, each horse
                    indeed eats his food by himself; but the expense of single stalls is more than
                    compensated by the greater ease, security, and comfort of the horses. The
                    trevices, or partitions which divide the stalls, are of deals two inches thick,
                    and about five feet high; but at the heads of the horses the partition rises to
                    the height of seven feet, and the length of the stall is usually from seven to
                    eight feet.</p>
                <p>The manger is generally continued the whole length of the stable. It is about
                    nine inches deep, twelve inches wide at the top, and nine at the bottom, all
                    inside measure, and is placed about two feet four inches from the ground.
                    Staples or rings are fixed in the breast of the manger, to which the horses are
                    tied.</p>
                <p>The rack for holding their hay or straw is also commonly continued the whole
                    length of the stable. It is formed of upright spars, connected by cross rails at
                    each end, and from two to two and a half feet in height. The rack is placed on
                    the wall, about one foot and a half above the manger, the bottom almost close to
                    the wall, and the top projecting outwards so as to form an angle with it of
                    twenty or twenty-five degrees. The spars are sometimes made round, and sunk into
                    the cross rails, and sometimes square. In a few stables lately built, the round
                    spars turn on a pivot, which facilitates the horse’s access to the hay, without
                    requiring the interstices to be so wide as to permit him to draw it out in too
                    large quantities.</p>
                <p>Immediately above the racks is an opening in the hayloft, through which the racks
                    are filled. When it is thought necessary, this may be closed by boards moving on
                    hinges.</p>
                <p>Behind the horses, and about nine feet from the front wall, is a gutter, having a
                    gentle declivity to the strawyard or urine-pit. Allowing about a foot for this,
                    there will remain a width of eight feet to the back wall, if the. stable be
                    eighteen feet wide; a part of which, close to the wall, may be occupied with
                    corn-chests and places for harness.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033345" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3345-0272"/>
                <p>In some of the best stables the racks occupy one of the angles between the wall
                    and trevices, and form the quadrant of a circle. The spars are perpendicular,
                    and wider placed than in the hanging racks. The hay-seed falls into a box below,
                    instead of being dropped on the ground, or incommoding the eyes and ears of the
                    horses.</p>
                <p>With a view to save both the hay and the seed, it is an advantage to have the
                    hay-stack so near the stable as to admit of the hay being thrown at once upon
                    the loft. In some stables there is no loft, and the hay is stored in a separate
                    apartment. The floor is, for the most part, paved with undressed stones; but, in
                    some instances, the space from the gutter to the back wall is laid with flags of
                    freestone.</p>
                <p>According to the plan we are describing, <hi rend="italic">cattle-houses</hi> are
                    placed on the other side of the straw-house, and, with a root-house, complete
                    the north side of the square. The extent of these, it is evident, depends not
                    only on the size of the farm, but on the general management, and must vary
                    according as rearing, fattening, or dairy cattle, form the principal object. To
                    avoid prolixity, let it be understood that this part of the range is allotted to
                    fattening cattle. There are three ways in which the cattle are placed; first, in
                    a row towards one of the side walls; second, in two rows, either fronting each
                    other, with a passage between, or with their heads towards both side walls; and,
                    third, across, or upon the width of the house, in successive rows, with
                    intervening passages for feeding and removing the dung. In the first plan it is
                    usual to have openings in the walls, through which they are supplied with
                    turnips, otherwise they must necessarily be served from behind, with much
                    inconvenience both to the cattle-feeder and the cattle themselves. The plan that
                    is most approved of, and which is now becoming general when new buildings are
                    erected, is to fix the stakes to which the cattle are tied about two and a half
                    or three feet from the wall; which allows the cattleman, without going among
                    them, to fill their troughs successively from his wheelbarrow or basket with
                    much ease and expedition. It is also a considerable improvement to keep the
                    cattle separate by partitions between every two. This will in a great measure
                    prevent accidents, and secure the quiet animals from being injured by the
                    vicious; for, in these double stalls, each may be tied up to a stake placed near
                    the partition, so as to be at some distance from his neighbour; and it is easy
                    to lodge together such as are alike in size and in temper. The width of such
                    stalls should not be less than 7½ feet, and the depth must be regulated by the
                    size of the cattle.</p>
                <p>Wherever a number of cattle are fed, an apartment is required for containing
                    turnips, potatoes, &amp;c. when brought from the field, until they are dealt out
                    into the troughs. This apartment is placed either on the line of the
                    cattlehouses, or begins another side of the square, at the angle of the junction
                    of the two sides. The outer door ought to be so large as to admit a loaded cart;
                    and there is an inner door that opens into the feeder’s walk along the heads of
                    the cattle. At the other end of this, a door opens into the straw-house; so that
                    their food and litter are not exposed to the weather, and the labour of the
                    fecdèr is greatly diminished.</p>
                <p>The east and west sides of the square consist chiefly of sheds for the straw-yard
                    cattle, and cart-sheds. But stables for young horses, riding-horses, and for
                    separating the sick from the others, may be placed upon that side which connects
                    with the common stable already described; and, in like manner, a part of the
                    opposite side, connecting with the cattle-houses, may be allotted to cows; or,
                    if^necessary, the feeding-houses may be continued. The cattle-sheds are open
                    towards the straw-yards, and the cart-sheds outwards to the road. On one of
                    these sides there should be a close apartment for small tools, and another for
                    preparing corn and roots by steam, which may also serve for other purposes. In
                    some convenient place near the stables and cattle-houses, or immediately over
                    them, there should be sleeping-rooms for the servant' who have the charge of
                    them, that they may be at hand in case of accidents during the night.</p>
                <p>Along the wall which completes the inclosure, such low buildings may be set down,
                    particularly hog-styes and poultry-houses, as maybe thought desirable. These
                    styes should open behind into the straw-yards, to which the hogs should have
                    access for picking up corn left on the straw, and such turnips, clover, &amp;c.
                    as are refused by the cattle. When they are kept in great numbers, it may be
                    necessary to allot them a range of styes, with yards in front, in another place,
                    as is commonly done by gentlemen farmers; but it is absurd fastidiousness in a
                    rentpaying farmer to exclude these profitable animals from a place where a few
                    of them will make themselves fat without a shilling of expense, and without any
                    real injury to the cattle among which they feed.</p>
                <p>It will be seen from the engraving (Plate XL), that a road, which should be
                    always kept in good order, goes along three sides of this square, from which
                    there is access to the houses, instead of entering through the .straw-yards from
                    the inclosed area. All the houses in which live stock are kept have an opening
                    behind towards the strawyards, for carrying out their dung.</p>
                <p>This plan, which, with slight variations, required by circumstances, is common in
                    the north of England and south of Scotland, is meant to combine convenience with
                    economy, and is well adapted to most arable farms in the occupancy of tenants.
                    Proprietors who farm, sometimes choose to add several other buildings, and at
                    the same time to vary a little their distribution. Thus, it is common to
                    separate the straw-yards from the sides of the square by a cart-way, towards
                    which all the doors open, and the hog-styes with yards are usually placed behind
                    one of the sides where they are least exposed to observation.</p>
                <p>In every case, it is absolutely necessary that there should be water in or near
                    the area. In the plan delineated in Plate XI. a pump is placed at the end of the
                    wall which divides the area, and along this wall are fixed troughs, to which the
                    cattle on each side have access at all times.</p>
                <p>When a great number of cattle are fed at the stake, it is necessary to have a
                    reservoir near the square to receive their urine. The urine is either applied to
                    the land in its liquid state, or earth, peat-moss, &amp;c. is thrown into the
                    pit in such quantities as may be necessary to absorb it. Sometimes the reservoir
                    is sunk below the area, and the urine raised by a pump, and spread over the
                    strawyard. But on those arable farms where no more cattle are reared or
                    fattened, and no more turnips consumed at the homestead, than what are needed
                    for converting the straw into manure, a reservoir for urine is not required, the
                    whole of it being absorbed by the straw as it is dropped.</p>
                <p>The practice of feeding cattle in small sheds and strawyards, or what are called
                    <hi rend="italic">hammels</hi> in Berwickshire, deserves to be noticed with
                    approbation, when saving of expense is not a paramount object. Two cattle are
                    usually kept together, and go loose, in which way they are thought by some to
                    thrive better than when tied to a stake, and, at the same time, feed more at
                    their ease than when a number are kept together, as in the common straw-yards.
                    All that is necessary is, to run partition-walls across the sheds and yards
                    already described; or if these are allotted <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033358"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3358-0273"/>to rearing stock, one side of the square,
                    separated by a cartway from the straw-yards, is appropriated to these
                    hammels.</p>
                <p>On large farms, a smith’s and a wright’s shop are found exceedingly convenient,
                    even though used only one or two days a week. Much time is lost in going to a
                    distance to the residence of these necessary mechanics; and it is now not
                    uncommon to have houses furnished with the necessary accommodations on farms of
                    this description, where the smith attends at stated intervals, and the wright
                    when wanted. It is better to set down these houses at a little distance, than to
                    place them on the square, whence, among other inconveniences, the danger from
                    fire is a sufficient reason for excluding them.</p>
                <p>The cottages for farm-servants, which are usually set down in a line, at not an
                    inconvenient distance from the offices, ought to contain each of them at least
                    two apartments with fire-places, though in some of the best cultivated counties
                    there is only one chimney, and no other division than what is made by the
                    furniture. But better accommodation for this useful and meritorious class is now
                    generally allowed in erecting new buildings. Every cottage has a small
                    kitchen-garden adjoining; and as farm-servants in the southern counties of
                    Scotland have each of them a cow, kept all the year on the farm as part of their
                    wages, it is common to attach a byre for them to the range of cottages, and
                    sometimes also hog-styes and apartments for fuel.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to say any thing of a farmer’s dwelling-house, as the size and
                    accommodations are very little different from those of other dwelling-houses
                    possessed by people of the same property or income. It is only on dairy farms
                    that particular apartments are necessarily appropriated to the business of a
                    farm; and these shall be described under a separate article. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dairy.</hi></p>
                <p>Most of the farm-buildings recently erected in the best cultivated counties are
                    covered with slate. A thatched roof is still common for cottages, though for
                    these also slate is beginning to be preferred. One cause of the comparative
                    sterility of land in former times, was the great quantity of straw that was
                    withdrawn from the food or litter of cattle, and used as thatch, instead of
                    being converted into manure.</p>
                <p>Tenants holding on leases for a term of years are usually taken bound to keep all
                    the houses on a farm in sufficient repair during their occupancy, and to leave
                    them so at their removal, having received them in such a state at their entry.
                    It is common to have them inspected by tradesmen, both at the beginning and
                    expiration of a lease, for the purpose of determining their condition, and
                    awarding such repairs as may be necessary. In some districts it is the practice
                    to ascertain their value at the commencement of a lease, the tenant being bound
                    at his removal, when a second valuation takes place, to pay or to accept the
                    difference. But the objections to this method arc obvious. If no change has
                    taken place during the currency of the lease in the price of materials and wages
                    of labour, the tenant suffers by being called upon to make good the decay
                    occasioned by the lapse of time, which ought to be considered as covered by his
                    rent. If, on the other hand, both materials and labour have advanced in price,
                    as was the case of late years, the proprietor may be obliged to make a large
                    payment to the removing tenant, even though the houses are rendered of less real
                    value, not only by time, but by carelessness or dilapidations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fences.</hi></p>
                <p>Next to implements and machinery and suitable buildings, fences are in most
                    situations indispensable to the profitable management of arable land. They are
                    not only necessary to protect the crops from the live stock of the farm, but
                    often contribute, in no small degree, by the shelter they afford, to augment and
                    improve the produce itself. On all arable farms on which cattle and sheep are
                    pastured, the case, security, and comfort, which good fences give, both to the
                    owner and the animals themselves, are too evident to require particular notice.
                    And as there are few tracts so rich as to admit of crops being carried off the
                    land for a succession of years, without the intervention of green crops consumed
                    where they grow, fences of some description or other can very rarely be
                    dispensed with, even in the most fertile and highly improved districts.</p>
                <p>There is no branch of husbandry so generally mismanaged as this. No district of
                    any considerable extent, perhaps, can be named, in which one does not see the
                    greater part of what are called fences, not only comparatively useless, but
                    wasteful to the possessor of the lands which they occupy, and injurious both to
                    himself and his neighbours, by the weeds which they shelter. This is
                    particularly the case with thorn hedges, which are too often planted in soils
                    where they can never, by any management, become a sufficient fence; and which,
                    even when planted on suitable soils, are in many cases so much neglected when
                    young, as ever afterwards to be a nuisance, instead of an ornamental, permanent,
                    and impenetrable barrier, which, with proper training, they might have formed in
                    a few years.</p>
                <p>Until of late, inclosures have too often been made without much regard to the
                    size of the farm, the exposure, the form of the fields, and the equability of
                    the soil. This is the more to be regretted in the case of live fences, which
                    ought to endure for a long course of years, and which cannot be eradicated
                    without considerable expense. It is impossible, indeed, to lay down any rules on
                    this subject that would be generally applicable; but upon a little reflection,
                    it must be evident that the size of the field should be suited not only to the
                    extent of the farm, but also to the nature of the soil, which ought to prescribe
                    the course of management, whether in alternate white or green crops, or with the
                    intervention of several years’ pasturage; that the exposure of the land should
                    be considered, in order that the fences may give the shelter that is most
                    required; that the form of the field should be such as to render it most
                    accessible from the farm-buildings, and that it may be cultivated at the least
                    expense, the lands or ridges not being too short, nor running out into angles at
                    the points where the fence takes a different direction; and that the soil of the
                    inclosure should be as nearly alike throughout as possible, that the whole field
                    may be always under the same kind of crop. It must, in general, be a matter of
                    consequence to have water in every inclosure; but this is too obvious to escape
                    attention.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the garden-like appearance which trees growing in hedges give to
                    the landscape, it seems to be agreed by the most intelligent agriculturists that
                    they are extremely hurtful to the fence, and, for some distance, to the crops on
                    each side; and it is evident that, in many instances, the highways, on the sides
                    of which they often stand, suffer greatly from their shade. It has therefore
                    been doubted whether such trees be profitable to the proprietor, or beneficial
                    to the public ;—to the farmer they are almost in every case injurious to a
                    degree beyond what is commonly imagined.</p>
                <p>In the subdivisions of an arable farm, whatever may be the kind of fence which it
                    is thought advisable to adopt, we would recommend that particular attention be
                    paid to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033371" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3371-0274"/>the
                    course of crops which the quality of the soil points out as the most
                    advantageous; and that, upon all farms not below a medium size, there should be
                    twice the number of inclosures that there are divisions or <hi rend="italic"
                    >breaks</hi> in the course. Thus, if a six years’ rotation be thought the most
                    profitable, there should be twelve inclosures, two of which are always under the
                    same crop. One very obvious advantage in this arrangement is, that it tends
                    greatly to equalize labour, and, with a little attention, may contribute much to
                    equalize the produce also. On large farms, where all the land under turnips and
                    clover, for instance, is near the extremity of the grounds, or at a considerable
                    distance from the buildings, supposed to be set down near the centre, it is
                    clear that the labour of supplying the house and straw-yard stock with these
                    crops, as well as the carriage of the manure to the field, is much greater than
                    if the fields were so arranged as that the half of each of these crops had been
                    near the offices. But by means of two fields for each crop in the rotation, it
                    is quite easy to connect together one field near the houses with another at a
                    distance, and thus to have a supply at hand for the home stock, while the
                    distant crops may be consumed on the ground. The same equalization of labour
                    must be preserved in the cultivation of the corn fields and in harvesting the
                    crops. The time lost in travelling to some of the fields, when working by the
                    plough, is of itself a matter of some consequence on large farms. But the
                    advantages of this arrangement are not confined to the equalization and economy
                    of labour; it may also in a great measure render the annual produce uniform and
                    equable, notwithstanding a considerable diversity in the quality of the soil. A
                    field of an inferior soil may be connected with one that is naturally rich; and
                    in the consumption of the green crops, as well as in the allowance of manure,
                    the poor land may be gradually brought nearer, in the quantity and quality of
                    its produce, to the rich, without any injury to the latter. Thus, a field under
                    turnips may be so fertile that it would be destructive to the succeeding corn
                    crop to consume the whole or the greater part on the gròund; while another may
                    be naturally so poor, or so deficient in tenacity, as to make it inexpedient to
                    spare any part for consumption elsewhere. By connecting these two under the same
                    crop,—by carrying from the one the turnips that are wanted for the
                    feeding-houses and straw-yards, and eating the whole crop of the other on the
                    ground with sheep, the ensuing crop of corn will not be so luxuriant on the
                    former as to be unproductive, while the latter will seldom fail to yield
                    abundantly. The same plan will also be advantageous in the case of other crops.
                    Hay or green clover may be taken from the richer field, and the poorer one
                    depastured; and on the one wheat may succeed both turnips and clover, while the
                    more gentle crops of barley and oats are appropriated to the less fertile
                    field.</p>
                <p>These observations are particularly applicable to turnip soils, of such a quality
                    as not to require more than one year’s pasturage, and which are therefore
                    cultivated with corn and green crops alternately; but the same principle may be
                    extended to clay lands, and such as require to be depastured two or more years
                    in succession.</p>
                <p>It is scarcely necessary to add, that upon wet soils, where hedges are employed
                    as fences, it is of importance that the ditches be drawn in such a direction as
                    to serve the purposes of drains, and also that they may receive the water from
                    the covered drains that may be required in the fields contiguous. According as
                    the line of the fence is more or less convenient in this respect, the expense of
                    draining may be considerably diminished or increased.</p>
                <p>The most common fences, of a permanent character, are <hi rend="italic">stone
                    walls</hi> and <hi rend="italic">white thorn hedges.</hi> Stone walls have the
                    recommendation of being an immediate fence, but the disadvantage of going
                    gradually to decay, and of requiring to be entirely rebuilt, in some cases every
                    twenty years, unless they are constructed with lime mortar, which is in many
                    districts much too expensive to be employed in erecting common fences. White
                    thorn hedges, on the contrary, though they require several years to become a
                    fence of themselves, may be preserved at very little expense afterwards in full
                    vigour for several generations.</p>
                <p>Having thus thrown out a few hints of a general nature on this important subject,
                    we shall only mention such of the fences as are in common use, and of a
                    permanent character, without attempting to enumerate all the varieties and
                    combinations which may be occasionally found in practice, or such as are only
                    meant to serve a temporary purpose.</p>
                <p>The two leading divisions, as just mentioned, are into hedges and stone walls; to
                    which are added in particular situations fences of iron, though these last are
                    for the most part confined to gentlemen’s parks, and partake as much of ornament
                    as utility.</p>
                <p>With regard to hedges, the plant in most common use is the white thorn, though we
                    have seen very good hedges composed of beech, holly, and other plants; and it is
                    not unusual to find a mixture of all these and others in many parts of England.
                    The best hedges, however, are composed exclusively of the white thorn, which,
                    when properly managed, makes the most effectual and durable of all fences. The
                    usual practice is to open a trench or ditch, and with the earth to form a bank,
                    on the face of which thorns are planted almost in a horizontal direction, and
                    with their tops protruding a few inches outwards; the bank being continued above
                    the roots of the thorns to such a height as may be deemed necessary. And as a
                    further protection, while the plants are young, a paling or a dead hedge is
                    carried along the top of the bank, which makes an effectual fence at the very
                    outset. When the thorns have grown up to form a sufficient fence of themselves,
                    the paling or dead hedge is no longer wanted. In some instances whins or furze
                    are sown upon the bank, for the same purpose of protecting the young thorns, and
                    rendering the fence more complete. The dimensions of the ditch and the height of
                    the bank are in a great measure arbitrary, depending upon the nature of the
                    soil, and whether the ditch is or is not required for the purpose of draining
                    the land. A double ditch is sometimes used, with a bank in the middle, and a row
                    of‘thorns on each side; but in ordinary cases it is a great objection that this
                    fence occupies so much space, besides being more expensive, both in forming and
                    rearing, than the single fence.</p>
                <p>Stone walls are constructed of different dimensions, according to the purposes
                    for which they are intended. The most common and generally useful for
                    agricultural purposes are about five feet high, built close, and finished on the
                    top with a coping of turf or long stones. The latter are laid on edge, and
                    project a little over the breadth of the wall, the interstices being filled up
                    and closely packed with small stones. In some parts of Scotland, what is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Galloway Dyke</hi> is found to form a very cheap and
                    useful fence on hilly grounds, where the inclosures are large. It is built close
                    or double for about two feet from the ground, and then carried up to the height
                    of four or four and a half feet with stones so placed as to admit of the light
                    passing through the wall; and when any part of it falls down, it is easily
                    repaired. Sheep, it is alleged, are deterred from leaping against such a <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193033384" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3384-0275"/> fence, from its
                    being thus open, more than they would be if it were built solid and of greater
                    height.</p>
                <p>A fence which combines in some measure the advantages of both the quick hedge and
                    the stone wall, has been found to answer in situations where the soil is not
                    well adapted to the ditch and hedge alone, and particularly where land stones
                    are abundant, and there is a scarcity of wood for rails or paling. This fence is
                    executed in the following manner: A ditch is formed, with one side of it
                    perpendicular, or nearly so, and a facing of stone is then begun at the bottom
                    and carried up regularly in the manner that stone walls are usually built, the
                    space between the wall and the side of the bank being filled up with the earth
                    taken out of the ditch, which should be of a good quality, and mixed with lime
                    or compost. The thorns are then laid down in such a manner as that four inches
                    or more of the root or stem shall rest upon the earth, the top of the plant
                    projecting beyond the wall. They are then covered with earth, and the wall and
                    the bank behind carried upwards as far as may be thought necessary. In this way
                    the plants appear to grow from the face of the wall which affords them
                    protection, and they are not so liable to be annoyed with weeds as if they had
                    been planted on a bank of earth. But this method seems better adapted to an
                    outside fence than to one for separating fields on either side, unless the wall
                    be carried up by itself considerably above the height of the bank. <hi
                    rend="italic">( General Report of Scotland,</hi> vol. i.)</p>
                <p>We may add, that in many instances there seems to be a radical error in the first
                    construction and subsequent management of hedge-fences in particular, which
                    might be easily removed under appropriate covenants of lease. The expense of
                    inclosing, and of course the direction and construction of the fences, ought to
                    be undertaken in almost every case by the proprietor, not merely for the sake of
                    relieving the tenant from a burden which may be incompatible with his
                    circumstances and professional duties, but also from a principle of economy on
                    the part of the landlord. Whatever may be the tenant’s knowledge and capital, it
                    is not to be expected that his views should extend much beyond his own
                    accommodation during his temporary occupation; whereas the permanent interest of
                    the landlord requires, not so much a minute attention to economy in the first
                    instance, as that the amelioration shall be as complete and as durable as
                    possible. The tenant’s outlay on fences must inevitably be returned by a
                    diminution of the yearly rent, and probably with a large profit for the first
                    advance of the money; while, at the same time, that money may be expended in an
                    improvement which is neither so complete nor so lasting as it might have been
                    rendered had it been done at the expense and under the direction of the
                    proprietor.</p>
                <p>But another error of the same kind is probably still more common, and by far more
                    pernicious to landholders. The fences are to be kept in repair by the tenant;
                    which, in so far as regards stone walls, is a stipulation no way objectionable.
                    But it often happens that a landlord, even though he runs a hedge-fence at his
                    own expense, leaves it to be trained up by the tenant without his interference;
                    and the consequence is, that in perhaps nine cases out of ten, it never becomes
                    a sufficient fence at all; that the original cost is lost for ever; and that the
                    land which it occupies is not only unproductive, but actually a nuisance.
                    Besides, it is evidently improper to require of a tenant to rear up a good
                    fence, commonly by a greater outlay than was required for forming it, when the
                    half of his lease perhaps must elapse before he can derive much benefit from it.
                    This mistake on the part of proprietors is probably the principal cause of the
                    badness of hedge-fences; for if they are neglected when the plants are young,—if
                    cattle are allowed to make gaps,—water permitted to stagnate in the ditch,—or
                    weeds to grow unmolested on the face of the bank, no labour or attention
                    afterwards will ever make an equal and strong fence. As it is well known how
                    difficult or rather impossible it is to enforce this care by any compulsory
                    covenants, the best plan for both parties is that which is adopted in some
                    districts, where hedges are reared at the mutual expense of landlord and
                    tenant,—the thorns, while they require it, being protected by rails, or
                    otherwise, so as to give the tenant all the advantages of a complete fence in
                    the mean time. In this case he cannot justly complain that he pays a share of
                    the expense; and this payment furnishes the strongest motive for preserving the
                    young thorns from damage, and for training them with such care as to become a
                    complete fence in the shortest possible period.</p>
                <p>The provisions of the law of Scotland in regard to inclosing have greatly
                    promoted this invaluable improvement. It holds out the greatest facilities, both
                    for straightening the boundaries of conterminous properties, and for erecting
                    march-fences, by obliging every proprietor, upon due notice from his neighbour,
                    to defray half the charges of such a fence as the nature of the soil and surface
                    may render most eligible. By an act in 1686, cattle must be constantly herded
                    during the day, if the pastures be not inclosed, and are ordered to be kept
                    during the night in houses, folds, or inclosures; a fine is exigible from the
                    owner if his cattle trespass on his neighbour’s lands,—so much for every
                    animal,—over and above the damage done, even where there are no fences; and, by
                    the statute 1695, heavy penalties are denounced against such as destroy
                    fences.</p>
                <p>As connected with the subject of fences and other rural works, though applicable
                    to many other purposes, we may notice an instrument called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odometer,</hi> exhibited a few years ago to the Highland Society of Scotland by
                    Mr Hunter of Thurston, of which figures will be found in Plate IX. By merely
                    walking from one end to the other of any wall, road, hedge, ditch, &amp;c. with
                    this instrument; which is not more troublesome than a walking-stick, the length
                    is found much more correctly than by a measuring chain, and with much greater
                    expedition. Mr Hunter has one so constructed as to measure nearly 1300 miles,
                    which may be attached to the wheel of any carriage, and will measure the road
                    passed along at any rate of travelling.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Tillage.</hi></p>
                <p>As the operations connected with tillage must necessarily be regulated by the
                    condition of the soil and surface, and the crops to be cultivated, as to which
                    we shall have occasion to treat in a subsequent section, all that is at present
                    necessary is, to offer a few general observations, premising that we here take
                    it for granted, that all those obstructions which fall to be considered under
                    the chapter on Natural Pastures and Wastes, have either never existed, or been
                    already removed.</p>
                <p>It is well known to every husbandman, that clayey or tenacious soils should never
                    be ploughed when wet; and that it is almost equally improper to allow them to
                    become too dry, especially if a crop is to be sown without a second ploughing.
                    The state in which such lands should be ploughed is that which is commonly
                    indicated by the phrase, “between the wet and the dry,”—while the ground is
                    slightly moist, mellow, and the least cohesive.</p>
                <p>In ploughing the first time for fallow or green crops, all good farmers begin
                    immediately after harvest, or after <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033397"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3397-0276"/>wheat sowing is finished; and when this land has
                    been gone over, the old tough swards, if there be any, are next turned up. The
                    reasons for ploughing so early are sufficiently obvious; as the frosts of winter
                    render the soil more friable for the spring operations, and assist in destroying
                    the weed-roots. In some places, however, the first ploughing for fallow is still
                    delayed till after the spring seed-time.</p>
                <p>In the following remarks, the <hi rend="italic">swing-plough,</hi> drawn by two
                    horses, is to be understood as the one emplöyed, if no other be mentioned; and
                    we shall here confine ourselves for the most part to the practice of the north
                    of England and the south-east of Scotland.</p>
                <p>Three different points require particular attention in ploughing: 1. the breadth
                    of the slice to be cut; 2. its depth; and 3. the degree in which it is to be
                    turned over;—which last circumstance depends both upon the construction of the
                    plough, particularly the mould-board, and the care of the ploughman.</p>
                <p>The breadth and depth of the furrow-slice are regulated by judiciously placing
                    the draught on the nozzle or bridle of the plough; setting it so as to go more
                    or less deep, and to take more or less land or breadth of slice, according as
                    may be desired. In general, the plough is so regulated that, if left to itself,
                    and merely kept from falling over, it would cut a little broader and a little
                    deeper than is required. The coulter is also placed with some inclination
                    towards the left or land side, and the point of the sock or share has a slight
                    tendency downwards.</p>
                <p>The degree to which the furrow-slice turns over, is in a great measure determined
                    by the proportion between its breadth and depth, which for general purposes is
                    usually as three is to two; or when the furrow is nine inches broad, it ought to
                    be six inches in depth. When the slice is cut in this proportion, it will be
                    nearly half turned over, or recline at an angle of 40 or 45 degrees; and a field
                    so ploughed will have its ridges longitudinally ribbed into angular drills or
                    ridgelets. But if the slice is much broader in proportion to its depth, it will
                    be almost completely overturned, or left nearly flat, with its original surface
                    downwards; and each successive slice will be somewhat overlapped by that which
                    was turned over immediately before it. And finally, when the depth materially
                    exceeds the width, each furrow-slice will fall over on its side, leaving all the
                    original surface bare, and only laid somewhat obliquely to the horizon.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of these modes of ploughing, where the breadth
                    and depth are nearly in the proportion already mentioned, is the best adapted
                    for laying up stubble land after harvest, when it is to remain during winter
                    exposed to the mellowing influence of frost, preparatory to fallow or turnips.
                    The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> or shallow furrow, of considerable width, as
                    five inches in depth by eight or nine wide, is understood to answer best for
                    breaking up old leys, because it covers up the grass turf, and does not bury the
                    manured soil. The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> is a most unprofitable and
                    uselessly slow operation, which ought seldom or never to be adopted. The most
                    generally useful breadth of a furrowslice is from eight to ten inches, and the
                    depth, which ought to be seldom less than four inches, cannot often exceed six
                    or eight inches, except in soils uncommonly thick and fertile. When it is
                    necessary to go deeper, as for carrots and some other deep-rooted plants, a
                    trench ploughing may be given by means of a second plough following in the same
                    furrow. Shallow ploughing ought always to be adopted after turnips are eaten on
                    the ground, that the manure may not be buried too deep; and also in covering
                    lime,—especially if the ground has been pulverized by fallowing, because it
                    naturally tends to sink in the soil. In ploughing down farm-yard dung, it is
                    commonly necessary to go rather deep, that no part of the manure may be left
                    exposed to the atmosphere. In the first ploughing for fallow or green crops, it
                    is advisable to work as deep as possible; and no great danger is to be
                    apprehended, though a small portion of the subsoil beat that time brought to the
                    surface.</p>
                <p>The furrow-slices are generally distributed into beds, varying in breadth
                    according to circumstances; these are called <hi rend="italic">ridges</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">lands,</hi> and are divided from one another by gutters or
                    open furrows. These last serve as guides to the hand and eye of the sower, to
                    the reapers, and also for the application of manures in a regular manner. In
                    soils of a strong or retentive nature, or which have wet, close subsoils, these
                    furrows serve likewise as drains for carrying off the surface water; and being
                    cleared out after the land is sown and harrowed, have the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">water-furrows.</hi></p>
                <p>Ridges are not only different in breadth, but are raised more or less in the
                    middle on different soils. On clayey, retentive soils, the great point to be
                    attended to is the discharge of superfluous water. But narrow stitches of from
                    three to five feet are not approved of in some of the best cultivated counties.
                    In these a breadth of fifteen or eighteen feet, the land raised by two <hi
                    rend="italic">gatherings</hi> of the plough, is most commonly adopted for such
                    soils; such a ridge being thought more convenient for manuring, sowing,
                    harrowing, and reaping, than a narrower one; and the water is drained off quite
                    as effectually.</p>
                <p>On dry, porous turnip soils, ridges may be formed much broader; and were it not
                    for their use in directing the labourers, may be, and sometimes are, dispensed
                    with altogether. They are often thirty or thirty-six feet broad, which -in
                    Scotland are called <hi rend="italic">band-win</hi> ridges, because reaped by a
                    band of shearers, commonly six, served by one binder. If it be wished to
                    obliterate the intermediate furrows, this may be done by casting up a narrow
                    ridgelet or single-bout drill between the broad ridges, which is afterwards
                    levelled by the harrows.</p>
                <p>With regard to the mode of forming these ridges straight and of uniform breadth,
                    let us suppose a field perfectly level that is intended to be laid off’ into
                    ridges of any determinate breadth. The best ploughman belonging to the farm
                    conducts the operation, with the aid of three or more poles shod with iron, in
                    the following manner: the first thing is to mark off the head ridges, on which
                    the horses turn in ploughing, which should in general be of an equal breadth
                    from the bounding lines of the field, if these lines are not very crooked or
                    irregular. The next operation, assuming one straight side of the field, or a
                    line that has been made straight, as the proper direction of the ridges, is to
                    measure off from it with one of the poles (all of them of a certain length, or
                    expressing specific measures) half the intended breadth of the ridge if it is to
                    be gathered, or one breadth and a half if to be ploughed flat; and there the
                    ploughman sets up a pole as a direction for the plough to enter. On a line with
                    this, and at some distance, he plants a second pole, and then in the same manner
                    a third, fourth, &amp;c. as the irregularity of the surface may render
                    necessary, though three must always be employed,—the last of them at the end of
                    the intended ridge, and the whole in one straight line. He then enters the
                    plough at the first pole, keeping the line of poles exactly between his horses,
                    and ploughs down all the poles successively; halting his horses at each, and
                    replacing it at as many feet distant as the ridges are to be broad; so that when
                    he reaches the end of the ridge, all his poles are again set up in a new line
                    parallel to the first. He returns, however, along his former track, cor <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193033410" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3410-0277"/> recting any
                    deviations, and throwing a shallow furrow on the side opposite to his former
                    one. These furrows, when reversed, form the crown of the ridge, and direct the
                    ploughmen who are to follow. The same operations are carried on until the whole
                    field is marked out. This is called <hi rend="italic">fairing</hi> in Scotland,
                    and <hi rend="italic">strììàng the furrows</hi> in England. It is surprising
                    with what accuracy these lines are drawn by skilful ploughmen.</p>
                <p>Another method has been adopted for the same purpose, which promises to be useful
                    with less experienced workmen. A stout lath or pole, exactly equal in length to
                    the breadth of the intended ridge, is fixed to the plough at right angles to the
                    line of the draught, one end of which is placed across the handles exactly
                    opposite the coulter, while the other end. projects towards the left hand of the
                    ploughman, and is preserved in its place by a rope passing from it to the collar
                    of the near side horse. At the outer end of the lath, a coulter or harrow tine
                    is fixed perpendicularly, which makes a trace or mark on the ground, as the
                    plough moves onwards, exactly parallel to the line of draught. By this device,
                    when the plough is <hi rend="italic">feiring</hi> the crown of one ridge, the
                    marker traces the line on which the next ridge is to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >feired. (General Report of Scotland</hi> vol. i. p. 354.)</p>
                <p>With regard to the · direction and the length of ridges, these points
                    must.evidently be regulated by the nature of the surface and the size of the
                    field. Short angular ridges, called <hi rend="italic">butts,</hi> which are
                    often necessary in a field with irregular boundaries', are always attended with
                    a considerable loss of time, and ought to be avoided as much as possible.</p>
                <p>In ploughing steep land it is advisable to give the ridges an inclination towards
                    the right hand at the top, by which in going up the acclivity the furrow falls
                    more readily from the plough, and with less fatigue to the horses. Another
                    advantage of forming ridges in a slanting direction on such land is, that the
                    soil is not so apt to be washed down from die higher ground, as if the ridges
                    were laid at right angles. Wherever circumstances will permit, however, the best
                    direction is due north and south, by which the grain on both sides of the ridge
                    derives nearly equal advantages from the influence of the sun.</p>
                <p>The land being thus formed into ridges, is afterwards cultivated without marking
                    out the ridges anew, until the inter-furrows have been obliterated by a fallow
                    or fallow crop. This is done by one or other of the following modes of
                    ploughing:—1. If the soil be dry and the land has been ploughed flat, the ridges
                    are split out in such a way, that the space which the crown of the old ridge
                    occupied is now allotted to the open furrow between the new ones. This is
                    technically called <hi rend="italic">crown-and-farrow</hi> ploughing. 2. When
                    the soil is naturally rather wet, or if the ridges have been raised a little by
                    former ploughings, the form of the old ridges, and the situation of the
                    inter-furrows, are preserved by what is called <hi rend="italic">casting</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> that is, the· furrows of each ridge are all laid in one
                    direction, while those of the next adjoining ridge are turned the contrary way;
                    two ridges being always ploughed together. 3. It is commonly necessary to raise
                    the ridges on soils very tenacious of moisture, by what is called <hi
                    rend="italic">gathering,</hi> which is done by the plough going round the ridge,
                    beginning at the crown and raising all the furrow-slices inwards. 4. This last
                    operation, when it is wished to give the land a level surface, as in fallowing,
                    is reversed by turning all the furrow-slices outwards, beginning at the
                    inter-furrows, and leaving an open furrow on the crown of each ridge. In order
                    to bring the land into as level a state as possible, the same mode of ploughing,
                    or <hi rend="italic">cleaving,</hi> as it is called, may be repeated as often as
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>High crooked ridges are .universally disapproved of, and are now very rare in the
                    best cultivated districts. A machine employed in levelling such land is
                    exhibited in Plate X.; and a reward was given by the Society of Arts in London
                    for the improvements made on it by Mr David Charles in 1803.</p>
                <p>On strong lands, a pair of good horses ought to plough three quarters of an acre
                    in nine hours; but upon the same land, after the first ploughing, or on friable
                    soils, one acre or an acre and a quarter is a common day’s work. Throughout the
                    year an acre a day may be considered as a full average on soils of a medium
                    consistency. The whole series of furrows on an English statute acre, supposing
                    each to be nine inches broad, would extend to 19,360 yards; and adding twelve
                    yards to every 220 for the ground travelled over in turning, the whole work of
                    one acre may be estimated as extending to 20,416 yards, or eleven miles and
                    nearly five furlongs.</p>
                <p>A kind of ploughing known by the name of <hi rend="italic">ribbing</hi> was
                    formerly common on land intended for barley, and was executed soon after
                    harvest, as a preparation for the spring ploughings. A similar operation is
                    still in use in some places, after land has been pulverized by clean ploughings,
                    and is ready for receiving the seed. By this method only half the land is
                    stirred, the furrow being laid over quite flat, and covering an equal space of
                    the level surface. But except in the latter instance, where corn is meant to
                    grow in parallel lines, and where it is used as a substitute for a
                    drill-machine, ribbing is highly objectionable, and has become almost
                    obsolete.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fallowing.</hi></p>
                <p>There is no branch of agricultural practice that has engaged more attention of
                    late than this; and after many years’ controversy, in which some of the ablest
                    cultivators of the present day have entered the lists, and exhausted perhaps all
                    the legitimate arguments on both sides, the practice does not appear to give
                    way, but rather to extend, on wet, tenacious clays; and it is only on such that
                    any one contends for the advantages of fallowing. The expediency or inexpediency
                    of pulverizing and cleaning the soil by a bare fallow, is a question that can be
                    determined only by experience, and not by argument. No reasons, however
                    ingenious, for the omission of this practice, can bring conviction to the mind
                    of a farmer who, in spite of all his exertions, finds, at the end of six or
                    eight years, that his land is full of weeds, sour, and comparatively
                    unproductive. Drilled and horse-hoed green crops, though cultivated with
                    advantage on almost every soil, are probably in general unprofitable as a <hi
                    rend="italic">substitute</hi> for fallow, and after a time altogether
                    inefficient. It is not because turnips, cabbages, &amp;c. will not' grow in such
                    soils, that a fallow is resorted to, but because, taking a course of years, the
                    value of the successive crops is found to be so much greater, even though an
                    unproductive year is interposed, as to induce a preference to fallowing.
                    Horse-hoed crops of beans, in particular, postpone the recurrence of fallow, but
                    in few situations can they ever exclude it altogether.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the instances that have been adduced of a profitable
                    succession of crops on soils of this description, without the intervention of a
                    fallow, are so well authenticated, that it would be extremely rash to assert
                    that it can in no case be dispensed with on clay soils. Instances of this kind
                    are to be found in different parts of Mr Young’s <hi rend="italic">Annals of
                    Agriculture</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a very notable one, on Mr Greg’s
                    fiirm of Coles, in Hertfordshire, is accurately detailed in the sixth volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Communications to the Board of Agriculture.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033423" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3423-0278"/>
                <p>The principal causes of this extraordinary difference among men of great
                    experience may probably be found in the quality of the soil, or in the nature of
                    the climate, or. in both. Nothing is more vague than the names by which soils
                    are known in different districts. Mr Greg’s farm in particular, though the soil
                    is denominated “heavy arable land,” and “very heavy land,” is found so suitable
                    to turnips, that a sixth part of it is always under that crop, and these are
                    consumed on the ground by sheep—a system of management which every farmer must
                    know to be altogether impracticable on the wet, tenacious clays of other
                    districts. It may indeed be laid down as a criterion for determining the
                    question, that wherever this management can be profitably adopted, fallow, as a
                    regular branch of the course, must be not less absurd than it is injurious both
                    to the cultivator and to the public. It is probable, therefore, that in debating
                    this point, the opposite parties are not agreed about the quality of the soil,
                    and in particular about its property of absorbing and retaining moisture, so
                    different in soils that in common language have the same denomination.</p>
                <p>Another cause of difference must be found in the climate. It is well known that a
                    great deal more rain falls on the west than on the cast coast of Britain, and
                    that between the southern and northern counties there is at least a month or six
                    weeks’ difference in the maturation of the crops. Though the soil therefore be
                    as nearly as possible similar in quality and surface, the period in which it is
                    accessible to agricultural operations must vary accordingly. Thus, in the
                    south-eastern counties of the island, where the crops may be all cut down, and
                    almost all carried home by the end of August, much may be done in cleansing and
                    pulverizing the soil during the months of September and October, while the
                    farmers of the north are exclusively employed in harvest work, which is
                    frequently not finished by the beginning of November. In some districts in the
                    south of England wheat is rarely sown before December; whereas in the north, and
                    still more in Scotland, if it cannot be got completed by the end of October, it
                    must commonly be delayed till spring, or oats or barley be taken in place of
                    wheat.</p>
                <p>It does not then seem of any utility to enter farther into this controversy,
                    which every skilful cultivator must determine for himself. All the crops, and
                    all the modes of management which have been proposed as a substitute for fallow,
                    are well known to such men, and would unquestionably have been generally adopted
                    long ago, if, upon a careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages
                    on both sides, a bare fallow was found to be unprofitable in a course of years.

                <p>However necessary the periodical recurrence of fallow may be on retentive clays,
                    its warmest advocates do not recommend it on turnip soils, or on any friable
                    loams incumbent on a porous subsoil; nor is it in any case necessary every third
                    year, according to the practice of some districts. On the best cultivated lands
                    it seldom returns oftencr than once in six or eight years, and in favourable
                    situations for obtaining an extra-supply of manure, it may be advantageously
                    dispensed with for a still longer period.</p>
                <p>Fallows are in many instances so grossly mismanaged, particularly where they
                    recur so often as to make it an object to derive some profit from them by means
                    of sheep, that it may be of use to describe the several operations, according to
                    the justly esteemed practice of East Lothian and Berwickshire.</p>
                <p>“Invariably after harvest, the land intended for being summer-failowed in the
                    ensuing yèar gets an end-long ploughing, which ought to be as deep as the soil
                    will admit, even though a little of the <hi rend="italic">till</hi> or subsoil
                    is brought up. This both tends to deepen the cultivated or manured soil, as the
                    fresh accession of hitherto uncultivated earth becomes afterward incorporated
                    with the former manured soil, and greatly facilitates the separation of the
                    roots of weeds during the ensuing fallow process, by detaching them completely
                    from any connection with the fast subsoil. This autumnal ploughing, usually
                    called the winter furrow, promotes the rotting of stubble and weeds; and if not
                    accomplished towards the end of harvest, must be given in the winter months, or
                    as early in the spring as possible. In giving this first ploughing, the old
                    ridges should be gathered up, if practicable, as in that state they are kept dry
                    during the winter months; but it is not uncommon to split them out or divide
                    them, especially if the land had been previously highly gathered, so that each
                    original ridge of land is divided into two half-ridges. Sometimes, when the land
                    is easily laid dry, the furrows of the old ridges are made the crowns of the new
                    ones, or the land is ploughed in the way technically called <hi rend="italic"
                    >crown-and-fur.</hi> In other instances, two ridges are ploughed together by
                    what is called <hi rend="italic">casting,</hi> which has been already described.
                    After the field is ploughed, all the interfurrows, and those of the headlands,
                    are carefully opened up by the plough, and are afterwards gone over effectually
                    by a labourer with a spade, to remove all obstructions, and to open up the water
                    furrows into the fence ditches, wherever that seems necessary, that all moisture
                    may have a ready exit. In every place where water is expected to lodge, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">dishes</hi> or hollow places in the field, cross or oblique
                    furrows are drawn by the plough, and their intersections carefully opened into
                    each other by the spade. Wherever it appears necessary, cross cuts are also made
                    through the head ridges into the ditches with a spade, and every possible
                    attention is exerted that no water may stagnate in any part of the field.</p>
                <p>“As soon as the spring seed-time is over, the fallow land is again ploughed
                    end-long. If formerly split, it is now ridged up; if formerly laid up in
                    gathered ridges, it is split or cloven down. It is then cross-ploughed; and
                    after lying till sufficiently dry to admit the harrows, it is harrowed and
                    rolled repeatedly, and every particle of the vivacious roots of weeds brought up
                    to view, carefully gathered by hand into heaps, and either burnt on the field or
                    carted off to the compost midden. The fallow is then ridged up, which places it
                    in a safe condition in the event ‘of bad weather, and exposes a new surface to
                    the harrows and roller; after which the weeds are again gathered by hand, but a
                    previous harrowing is necessary. It is afterwards ploughed, harrowed, rolled,
                    and gathered as often as may be necessary to reduce it into fine tilth, and
                    completely to eradicate all root-weeds. Between these successive operations,
                    repeated crops of seedling weeds are brought into vegetation and destroyed. The
                    larvae likewise of various insects, together with an infinite variety of the
                    seeds of weeds, are exposed to be devoured by birds, which are then the farmer’s
                    best friends, though often proscribed as his bitterest enemies.</p>
                <p>“Some writers on husbandry have condemned the use <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193033436" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3436-0279"/>of the harrow and roller in
                    the fallow process, alleging that frequent ploughing is all that is necessary to
                    destroy root-weeds, by the baking or drying of the clods in the sun and wind;
                    but experience has ascertained, that frequently turning over the ground, though
                    absolutely necessary while the fallow process is going on, can never eradicate
                    couchgrass or other root-weeds. In all clay soils the ground turns up in lumps
                    or clods, which the severest drought will not penetrate so sufficiently as to
                    kill the included roots. When the land is again ploughed, these lumps are simply
                    turned over and no more, and the action of the plough serves in no degree to
                    reduce them, or at least very imperceptibly. It may be added, that these lumps
                    likewise inclose innumerable seeds of weeds, which cannot vegetate unless
                    brought under the influence of the sun and air near the surface. The diligent
                    use, therefore, of the harrow and roller, followed by careful hand-picking, is
                    indispensably necessary to the perfection of the fallow process.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(General Report of Scotland,</hi> vol. i. p. 419.)</p>
                <p>When effectually reduced to fine tilth, and thoroughly cleansed from roots and
                    weeds, the fallow is ploughed end-long into gathered, ridges or lands, usually
                    15 or 18 feet broad, which are set out in the manner already described in
                    treating of the striking of furrows, or <hi rend="italic">feiring.</hi> If the
                    seed is to be drilled, the ridges are made of such widths as may suit the
                    construction of the particular drill-machine that is to be employed. After the
                    land has been once gathered by a deep furrow, proportioned to the depth of the
                    cultivated soil, the manure is laid on, and evenly spread over the surface,
                    whether muck, lime, marl, or compost A second gathering is now given by the
                    plough; and this being generally the furrow upon which the seed is sown, great
                    care is used to plough as equally as possible. After the seed is sown and the
                    land thoroughly harrowed, all the inter-furrows, furrows of the headlands, and
                    oblique or <hi rend="italic">gaw</hi> furrows, are carefully opened up with the
                    plough, and cleared out with the spade, as already mentioned respecting the
                    first or winter ploughing.</p>
                <p>The expense of fallowing must appear, from what has been said, to be very
                    considerable, when land has been allowed to become stocked with weeds; but if it
                    be kept under regular management, corn alternating with drilled pulse or green
                    crops, the subsequent returns of fallow will not require nearly so much labour.
                    In common cases, from four to six ploughings are generally given, with harrowing
                    and rolling between, as may be found necessary; and, as we have already noticed,
                    the <hi rend="italic">cultivator</hi> may be employed to diminish this heavy
                    expense. But it must be considered, that upon the manner in which the fallow
                    operations are conducted depends not only the ensuing wheat crop, but in a great
                    measure all the crops of the rotation.</p>

                    of Crops.</hi></p>
                <p>The crops cultivated in Britain present every variety of which the soil and
                    climate will admit; and in an agricultural point of view may be considered under
                    several divisions, according to their nature, or the purposes for which they are
                    intended. The most popular arrangement places all sorts of farm crops under the
                    two general heads of corn and green crops; the former applicable to the use of
                    man, and the latter to that of cattle, sheep, and other varieties of live stock.
                    The former include the different <hi rend="italic">cerealia,</hi> of which the
                    most important are wheat, barley, rye, and oats. The latter, or green crops,
                    comprise a still greater variety, the words being, in common language, applied
                    not only to pulse or leguminous plants, such as peas, beans, tares, &amp;c. but
                    also to the different varieties of herbage, as well as to turnips, potatoes, and
                    other roots. A leading distinction between these two divisions is, that corn or
                    other culmiferous plants ripening their seeds are held to be scourging crops,
                    whereas those that fall under the denomination of green crops are considered to
                    be of an ameliorating description, or at least as not impairing the productive
                    powers of the soil in the same degree. As it is our object to treat only of
                    matters of practical utility, we shall not attempt any scientific arrangement,
                    but content ourselves with describing the principal crops, with their mode of
                    culture, produce, and application, in popular language, confining our remarks at
                    present chiefly to such as are cultivated from year to year, as distinguished
                    from those which, like the pasture grasses, are intended to occupy the soil
                    permanently or for an indefinite period. Of these by far the most important
                    is,</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Wheat.</hi></p>
                <p>The soil best adapted to this grain is a clay or strong loam, though its growth
                    is by no means confined to such soils. Before the introduction of turnips and
                    clover, all soils but little cohesive were thought quite unfit for wheat; but,
                    even on sandy soils, it is now grown extensively and with much advantage after
                    either of these crops. The greater part of the wheat crop throughout Britain,
                    however, is probably still sown upon fallowed land. When it succeeds turnips
                    consumed on the ground, or clover cut for hay or soiling, it is commonly sown
                    after one ploughing; but, upon heavier soils, or after grass of two or more
                    years, the land is ploughed twice or three times, or receives what is called a
                    <hi rend="italic">rag-fallow.</hi></p>
                <p>The varieties of this grain are so numerous as not to admit of being enumerated
                    here; but the most general classification is according to colour, all the
                    varieties being divided into white and red, though with several shades between;
                    or according to the time which the grain requires to remain in the ground, being
                    either sown before winter, or in the spring months; and hence the distinction
                    between winter and spring or summer wheat. But this last variety must not be
                    confounded with the winter wheats, which are sometimes sown in spring. Several
                    other differences in wheat are sufficiently obvious: thus, the true summer wheat
                    is usually bearded, and some of the winter varieties are distinguished by being
                    woolly-cared, or by the thickness of the chaff; all which and other
                    peculiarities give rise to different names, which are sufficiently understood in
                    particular districts, though not in general use.</p>
                <p>The fine white wheats are considered more delicate than the red; but the latter,
                    though seldom sown on rich warm soils, are found most profitable, from their
                    hardiness and early ripening, on inferior land, in an unfavourable climate. A
                    great many different sorts of summer wheat, transmitted some years ago to the
                    president of the Board of Agriculture by the Agricultural Society of Paris, were
                    divided, for the purpose of experiment, among several distinguished
                    agriculturists (<hi rend="italic">Communications to the Board of
                    Agriculture,</hi> vol. vii. page 11); but their comparative merits, or
                    adaptation to the climate of Britain, do not seem to have been satisfactorily
                    ascertained. Summer, or, as it is often called, spring wheat, has, however, been
                    long and extensively cultivated in some parts of England, particularly in
                    Lincolnshire, and may probably be found a valuable crop in the southern
                    counties; but the trials that have been made of it in the north do not entitle
                    it to a preference over winter wheat sown in spring, or even to oats or barley,
                    in that climate. It is sometimes usefully employed in filling up any blanks that
                    appear in spring among the winter-sown wheats <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193033449" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3449-0280"/><hi rend="italic">Winter</hi>
                    wheat is sown on early turnip soils, after clover or turnips, at almost every
                    period from the beginning of September till the middle of March; but the far
                    greater part is sown in September and October. For <hi rend="italic">summer</hi>
                    wheat, in the southern districts, May is sufficiently early; but in the north,
                    the last fortnight of April is thought a more eligible seed-time. In the
                    cultivation of spring-sown winter wheat, it is of importance to use the produce
                    of spring-sown grain as seed, as the crop of such grain ripens about a fortnight
                    earlier than when the produce of the same wheat winter-sown is employed as
                    spring seed.</p>
                <p>Wheat, before being sown, is usually prepared with <hi rend="italic">pickles</hi>
                    or steeps and quicklime, as a preventive of <hi rend="italic">smut.</hi> We
                    shall only add a short account of a method of preparation which has been
                    followed with success in the south of Scotland, and of the efficacy of which we
                    can speak from our own experience. Take four vessels, two of them smaller than
                    the other two, the former with wire bottoms, and of a size to contain about a
                    bushel, the latter large enough to hold the smaller within them. Fill one of the
                    large tubs with water, and, putting the wheat in a small one, immerse it in the
                    water, and stir and skim off the grains that float above; and renew the water as
                    often as is necessary, till it comes off almost quite clean. Then raise the
                    small vessel in which the wheat is contained, and repeat the process with it in
                    the other large tub, which is to be filled with stale urine; and in the mean
                    time wash more wheat in the water tub. When abundance of water is at hand, this
                    operation is by no means tedious; and the wheat is much more effectually
                    cleansed from all impurities, and freed more completely from weak and unhealthy
                    grains and the seeds of weeds, than can be done by the winnowing-machine. When
                    thoroughly washed and skimmed, let it drain a little, then empty it on a clean
                    floor, or in the cart that is to take it to the field, and riddle quicklime upon
                    it, turning it over, and mixing it with a shovel, till it be sufficiently dry
                    for sowing.</p>
                <p>Wheat is most commonly sown <hi rend="italic">broad-cast,</hi> in a manner too
                    well known to need any description. Drilling is, however, extensively practised
                    in some districts, and is becoming more general on lands infested with the seeds
                    of annual weeds, especially when sown in spring. A machine which sows at three
                    different intervals, according to the judgment of the farmer, of 12, 10½, or 9
                    inches, is much approved of in Scotland. It deposits six, seven, or eight rows
                    at once, according as it is adjusted to one or other of these intervals, and the
                    work is done with ease and accuracy when the ridges are previously laid out of
                    such a breadth, 12½ feet, as to be sown by one <hi rend="italic">bout</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the machine going along one side of such a ridge, and
                    returning on the other, and its direction being guided by one of its wheels,
                    which thus always runs in the open furrow between the ridges. If the 10½ inch
                    interval be adopted, and it is the most common one in that country, the machine
                    sows seven rows at once, or 14 rows on a ridge of 12½ feet. But the space
                    between the rows varies in some parts still more than this machine admits of; it
                    ought not, however, to be so narrow as to prevent hand-hoeing, even after the
                    crop has made considerable progress in growth; and it cannot advantageously be
                    so wide as to admit the use of any effective horse-hoe.</p>
                <p>A third mode of sowing is common in some places, by which a drill-machine is
                    dispensed with, though the same purpose is nearly answered. This is by what is
                    called <hi rend="italic">ribbing,</hi> which we have already adverted to in the
                    section on tillage. The seed is scattered with the hand in the usual broad-cast
                    manner, but as it necessarily falls for the most part in the furrows between the
                    ribbs, the crop rises in straight parallel rows, as if it had been sown by a
                    drill machine; and the ribbs are afterwards levelled by harrowing across them.
                    This plan has nearly all the advantages of drilling, in so far as regards
                    exposure to the rays of the sun, and the circulation of air among the plants;
                    but, as some plants must always rise between the rows, it is not quite so proper
                    when hand-hoeing is required.</p>
                <p>The dibbling of wheat is practised to some extent in the county of Norfolk, and
                    occasionally in other quarters, though it is perhaps too laborious and tedious a
                    process in our unsteady climate ever to come into general use. An expert
                    dibbler, with the assistance of three children to drop the grains, goes over
                    about half an acre a day; and the seed, which is usually from one bushel to six
                    pecks per acre, is covered by means of a bush-harrow. The principal, if not the
                    only advantage that attends this method, is the saving of seed. An attempt was
                    made to employ a machine for the purpose, but it has never come into use. We
                    have seen a field of which a part was sown broad-cast and a part dibbled, for
                    the purpose of comparison; and the latter certainly appeared at the time more
                    equal and luxuriant than the former, but it had no superiority in point of
                    produce, except perhaps that it contained a less proportion of small grains, or
                    presented altogether a more equal sample.</p>
                <p>The quantity of seed necessary depends both on the time of sowing and the state
                    of the land; land sown early requiring less than the same land when sown in
                    winter or spring, and poor land being at all times allowed more seed than the
                    rich. The quantity accordingly varies from two bushels or less to three, and
                    sometimes even to four bushels per imperial acre. Winter wheat, when sown in
                    spring, ought always to have a liberal allowance, as the plants have not time to
                    tiller much without unduly retarding their maturation.</p>
                <p>When wheat is sown broad-cast, the subsequent culture must generally be confined
                    to harrowing, rolling, and hand-hoeing. As grass-seeds are frequently sown in
                    spring on winter-sown wheat, the harrows and roller are employed to loosen the
                    soil and cover the seeds. But these operations, to a certain extent, and at the
                    proper season, are found beneficial to the wheat crop itself, especially on
                    strong clays, and arc sometimes performed even when grass-seeds are not to be
                    sown. One or two courses of harrowing penetrate the crust which is formed on
                    tenacious soils, and operate like hand-hoeing in raising a fresh mould to the
                    stems of the young plants. Rolling in spring ought never to be omitted on dry,
                    porous soils, which are frequently left in so loose a state by the winter
                    frosts, that the roots quit the soil and perish; and if the land be rough and
                    cloddy, the roller has a still more beneficial effect than the harrows in
                    pulverizing the inert masses, and extending the pasture of the plants.
                    Hand-weeding, so far as to cut down thistles and other long weeds, is never
                    neglected by careful farmers; but the previous culture ought to leave as little
                    as possible of this work to be done when the crop is growing. Annual weeds,
                    which are the most troublesome, can only be effectually destroyed by
                    hand-hoeing; and to admit of this, the crop should be made to rise in rows, by
                    being sown either by a drill-machine, or on ribbs. Where grass-seeds are to be
                    sown on drilled wheat, the hand-hoeing assists in covering them.</p>
                <p>Wheat, which is almost universally reaped with the sickle, ought not to stand
                    till it be what is called <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> ripe, when the loss is
                    considerable, both upon the field and in the stack-yard. When cut, it is usually
                    tied up in sheaves, which it is better to make so small as to be done by bands
                    the length of the straw, than so thick as to require two lengths to be joined
                    for bands. The sheaves <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033462"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3462-0281"/>are set up in <hi rend="italic">shocks</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">stooks,</hi> each containing in all twelve, or, if the straw be
                    long, fourteen sheaves. In the latter case, two rows of six sheaves are made to
                    stand in such a manner as to be in contact at the top, though, in order to admit
                    the circulation of air, at some distance below; and along this line two sheaves
                    more are placed as a covering, the corn end of both being towards the
                    extremities of the line. In a few days of good weather the crop is ready for the
                    barn or stack-yard. In the stack-yard, which is commonly contiguous to the
                    farm-offices, having the barn on one of its sides, it is built either in oblong
                    or circular stacks, sometimes on frames supported with pillars, to prevent the
                    access of vermin, and to secure the bottom from dampness; and as soon afterwards
                    as possible the stacks are neatly thatched. When the harvest weather is so wet
                    as to render it difficult to prevent the stacks from heating, it has been the
                    practice to make funnels through them, a large one in a central and
                    perpendicular direction, and small lateral ones to communicate with it. A
                    particular method of constructing pillars, frames, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >bosses,</hi> as the funnels are called, is described in a recent publication.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Husbandry of Scotland,</hi> vol. i. p. 373.) In the best
                    cultivated counties, the use of large barns for holding the crop is disapproved
                    of, not only on account of the expense, but because corn keeps better, or is
                    less exposed to damage of any kind, in a well-built stack.</p>
                <p>By means of the threshing-mill all sorts of corn are expeditiously separated from
                    the straw and dressed for market One man feeds the grain in the straw into the
                    machine, and is assisted by two half-grown lads, or young women, one of whom
                    pitches or carries the sheaves from the bay close to the threshing-stage, while
                    the other opens the bands of every sheaf, and lays the sheaves successively on a
                    small table close by the feeder, who spreads them evenly on the feeding-stage,
                    that they may be drawn in successively by the fluted rollers, to undergo the
                    operation of threshing. In the opposite end of the barn or straw-house into
                    which the rakes or shakers deliver the clean threshed straw, one man forks up
                    the straw from the floor to the <hi rend="italic">straw-mow,</hi> and two lads,
                    or young women, build it and tread it down. In a threshing-machine worked by
                    water or wind this is the whole expense of hand labour in the threshing part of
                    the operation; and as a powerful machine can easily thresh from two to three
                    hundred bushels of grain in a working day of nine hours, the expense is
                    exceedingly small indeed. Assuming 250 bushels as an average for the work of
                    these people for one day, and their wages to be nine shillings, the expense does
                    not amount to one halfpenny for each bushel of grain. Even reducing the quantity
                    of grain threshed to 150 bushels, the easy work of ,a good machine of inferior
                    size and power, the expense does not exceed three farthings the bushel. But the
                    whole of this must not be charged against the threshing only, the grain being
                    half-dressed at the same time, by passing through one winnowing-machine, which
                    is always attached to a complete threshing-mill; and where a second can be
                    conveniently connected with it, as is commonly the case if the mill be of
                    considerable power, the corn comes down nearly ready for market: so that the
                    threshing, dressing, and building of the straw, with the use of a powerful
                    water-mill, will scarcely cost more than dressing alone when the flail is
                    employed, after every reasonable allowance for the interest of money, and the
                    tear and wear of the machine.</p>
                <p>When grain is threshed with a machine worked by horses, the expense is
                    necessarily and considerably enhanced. One capable of effecting the larger
                    quantity of work already calculated on will require eight good horses, and a man
                    to drive them, who may perhaps require the aid of a boy. The value of the work
                    of eight horsés for a day may be stated at 30 shillings, and the wages of the
                    driver may be called two shillings and sixpence. Hence the total expense of
                    threshing 250 bushels may amount to about twopence per bushel, when the wages of
                    the attendants are added; still leaving a considerable difference in favour of
                    threshing by the machine in preference to the flail. Were it even ascertained
                    that the expense of threshing by horses and by the flail is nearly the same,
                    horse-mills are to be recommended on other accounts; such as better threshing,
                    expedition, little risk of pilfering, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The produce of this crop, like that of most others, necessarily depends mainly
                    upon the nature of the soil and season. In a rich clayey loam it has been known,
                    to yield so much as eight quarters the imperial acre, weighing when dressed
                    about 60 lbs. the bushel; but the common return has been estimated at less than
                    half this quantity, and the average cannot perhaps be safely stated higher
                    throughout any one county than from 3 to 3½ quarters, the weight varying from 54
                    to 62 or 64 lbs. per bushel. The weight of the straw, which may run from a ton
                    to a ton and half per acre, is used for thatch, packing, and, in the country,
                    chiefly for litter to the live stock.</p>
                <p>The season best adapted for wheat is universally understood to be a summer in
                    which there is much sunshine and little rain. Both in regard to quantity and
                    quality, the crop is always best in a season rather too dry and hot for some
                    other crops, the produce being then usually much greater than the bulk of the
                    straw would lead one to expect.</p>
                <p>Wheat is liable to a variety of diseases, particularly in the more advanced
                    stages of its growth.. Of these the most destructive are <hi rend="italic"
                    >smut</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mildew.</hi> The former appears in the shape of
                    a black or smut ball <hi rend="italic">(ly coper don</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >globosum),</hi> which partially occupies the ear of the stalk, to the exclusion
                    of the grain, and so far lessens the quantity of produce. But its worst effect
                    is, that when the ball crumbles into powder in the threshing and dressing, this
                    powder contaminates more or less all the sound grain, and thus greatly injures
                    the quality of the whole, whether it be converted into flour or used as seed. If
                    it prevails to a great extent, the wheat is rendered quite unfit for being sown,
                    and ought never to be used in that way, to whatever process it may be previously
                    subjected. We have already noticed a useful method of preparing the seed, which
                    answers the double purpose of clearing the grain from any slight taint of smut,
                    and of separating light grains as well as noxious seeds, but we are aware that
                    the same effect may be obtained by various other means. The object in all cases
                    is to destroy the infection to which the grain is liable from the powder of the
                    smut ball, as it is a general opinion among all intelligent agriculturists, that
                    smut in the seed will produce a smutted crop if sown without preparation. But
                    the safest course is to select such grain for seed as exhibits no appearance of
                    smut at all.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mildew</hi> is a disease of a very different nature from smut,
                    and its ravages in the most aggravated cases are far more destructive. It is
                    generally thought to be produced by a peculiar state of the atmosphere; and when
                    it comes on between the periods of flowering and ripening, it has been known to
                    destroy whole fields within a few days. In such cases nothing can be done either
                    by way of prevention or remedy. It has been found, however, that in all seasons
                    mildew prevails more or less in particular situations; and there is reason to
                    believe that the vicinity of the barberry bush, and probably several other
                    shrubs,contributes to produce it, the same parasitical fungi being found on the
                    straw of mildewed wheat which are known to abound on the barberry and some other
                    plants. The prevalence of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033475"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3475-0282"/>heavy fogs or mist, drizzling rains, and sudden
                    changes in the temperature, have been assigned as the causes of mildew; and as
                    it has been found that open airy exposures are much less affected than low
                    sheltered lands, in years when mildew prevails most generally, the disorder may
                    perhaps be somewhat diminished by drilling, which admits a freer circulation of
                    air. Spring or summer wheat is less liable to mildew than the winter species,
                    though it does not always escape. (Sir Joseph Banks <hi rend="italic">on
                    Mildew,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Communications to the Board of
                    Agriculture,</hi> vol. vii.)</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Rye.</hi></p>
                <p>The cultivation of this species of grain is more limited than it was in former
                    times, when rye, either by itself or mixed with wheat, furnished the bread of
                    the labouring classes; and in most parts of Britain there is no steady demand
                    for it. It is nevertheless a profitable crop in particular districts, and
                    especially on sandy soils, that will scarcely carry any other kind of grain.
                    There are two general varieties, the one sown before winter, and the other in
                    spring; and it is further distinguished by its black or white colour. The winter
                    sort, which is the most plump and hardy grain, is sometimes cultivated as a
                    green crop, to be eaten in spring, where turnips are not raised, or after they
                    are consumed. There is nothing in its habits or mode of culture that requires
                    particular notice. It is sometimes sown on the margins of fields, near
                    farmhouses, as a protection to other crops against the depredations of poultry,
                    which do not feed on it, and seldom penetrate through it; and its straw is more
                    valuable for thatch, though useless as fodder, than that of any other species of
                    corn.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Barley.</hi></p>
                <p>This is a much less hardy grain than either of the former, and succeeds best on a
                    finely pulverized soil, not so little cohesive as that which will carry rye, but
                    much farther removed, on the other hand, from the clays best adapted to the
                    growth of wheat. It is cultivated largely as a rotation crop in most parts of
                    Britain, and generally sown after turnips, though sometimes after beans or peas;
                    and even after a bare fallow, if the land be not thought fit for wheat, or if
                    the weather has prevented it from being sown at the proper season. Spring-sown
                    wheat, either of the winter or summer species, and early oats, particularly the
                    potato variety, now occupy a portion of the land that was formerly allotted to
                    barley.</p>
                <p>The most intelligible distinction among the different kinds of barley is founded
                    on the number of the rows on the ear. Thus we have <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hordeum</hi><hi rend="italic">disuclion,</hi> two-rowed barley, which is the
                    kind most extensively cultivated, and comprises several varieties; <hi
                    rend="italic">Hordeum tetrastichon,</hi> four-rowed barley, often called <hi
                    rend="italic">bear</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bigg,</hi> the culture of which is,
                    for the most part, confined to inferior soils, or to situations where the
                    climate is unfavourable to the former species; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hordeum</hi><hi rend="italic">hexastichon,</hi> or six-rowed barley, which is
                    but little known in Britain, though it is the prevailing kind in the north of
                    Europe, and said to be the hardiest of all.</p>
                <p>To whatever crop barley succeeds, die harrow and roller, when the plough alone is
                    insufficient, should be employed in reducing the soil to a considerable degree
                    of fineness. In most cases more than one earth is· given; though, after a winter
                    furrow, the <hi rend="italic">cultivator</hi> may be used in spring instead of
                    the plough. After turnips, eaten on the ground by sheep, the land, being
                    consolidated by their treading, sometimes receives two ploughings; but if only
                    one, it should be well harrowed and rolled; and it is often finished by
                    harrowing after the roller, especially if grassseeds be sown, which are covered
                    by this last harrowing. Barley is sometimes sown on the first ploughing, and
                    covered by a second shallow ploughing. As it is found of <hi rend="superscript">

                    and may be sown later. Winter-sown barley, which may be eaten in spring and
                    afterwards stand for a crop, is found to answer well in particular districts. On
                    land infested with annual weeds, the drilling of this grain is an advantageous
                    practice; but throughout the country at large, this, and all other culmiferous
                    crops, are more generally sown <hi rend="italic">broad-cast.</hi> If the land be
                    rich, a small quantity of seed is sufficient; often so little as two bushels per
                    acre, and seldom more than three or three and a half; and its produce varies
                    from three to five quarters the acre, and may average four quarters. The chief
                    consumption is in the distilleries and breweries; but in the north of England,
                    and in Scotland, it is partially used for bread, either by itself, or mixed up
                    with a small proportion of beans or peas, though much less so now than formerly.
                    Part of it is made into what are called pot barley and pearl barley, in which
                    the husk is taken off at the mill; and, in the latter case, so much of the
                    kernel as to give it a round form. It is also occasionally ground into flour by
                    taking out the bran, and in this state made into cakes, which are much esteemed
                    in some parts of Scotland.</p>
                <p>Barley, like wheat, is most productive in a dry, warm season. For this reason,
                    what is grown in the south of England is almost always superior to the produce
                    of the northern parts of the island. It is not, like wheat, liable to any
                    peculiar disease; and is, of all the corn-crops, the best nurse for clover,
                    which, under good management, is usually sown along with it. The straw of this
                    grain, which may weigh upon an average about a ton per acre, is used chiefly as
                    litter for live stock.</p>
                <p>Barley is cut down in some places with the sickle, and in others with the scythe;
                    in England, very commonly with the latter, and in Scotland, almost always with
                    the former. It is the most difficult of all the species of corn to save in a
                    precarious harvest, and usually requires more labour in threshing and dressing,
                    particularly in separating the <hi rend="italic">awns</hi> from the grain, for
                    which an apparatus called a <hi rend="italic">hummelling</hi>-machine is
                    sometimes added to the threshing-mill.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Oats.</hi></p>
                <p>This hardy grain is sown, with little preparation, <hi rend="smallcaps">mi</hi>
                    almost every kind of soil, and too often follows culmiferous crops, as well as
                    pulse, herbage, and bulbous-rooted plants. Where a correct course of alternate
                    white and green crops prevails, oats usually succeed dover; and it is almost
                    always the first crop on land that has been several years in grass. As it
                    prospers, best on a soil not too finely pulverized, it is commonly sown on one
                    earth.</p>
                <p>There are numerous varieties of this species, which are distinguished by colour,
                    form, and the period of ripening; and by the· names of the countries, such as
                    the Poland and the Dutch, from whence they are understood to have been brought,
                    or of the places where they were originally cultivated. The chief of these are
                    the common white variety, so well known as to need no description; the red; and
                    what is called the potato-oat. For land in good cultivation, the two latter are
                    probably the best,—the red <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033488"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3488-0283"/>for uplands exposed to high winds,—and the potato
                    variety in lower situations. Both of these are early, and yield more abundantly,
                    in grain as well as meal, than most others. The potato-oat is said to have been
                    discovered by accident in Cumberland in 1788. <hi rend="italic">{Farmer s
                    Magazine,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 167.) But it is now very extensively raised, on
                    suitable soils, in the north of England, and throughout the lowlands of
                    Scotland. It usually brings a higher price at Marklane than any other variety.
                    The red oat is so called from the colour of its husk: it has a thinner and more
                    flexible stem, and the grain is more firmly attached to it, than in any of the
                    early varieties; so that upon good soils, in high situations, as it is in less
                    danger of suffering from wind, and is at the same time so much earlier than the
                    common kinds, it is entitled to a decided preference, particularly in a late
                    climate. It is understood to have originated in the county of Peebles, and is
                    sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">Magbiehill-oat,</hi> from the name of the
                    estate where it was first cultivated.</p>
                <p>Oats are sown, usually <hi rend="italic">broad-cast,</hi> in the months of March
                    and April, seldom earlier or later; and from four to six bushels are allowed to
                    an acre. The produce, which varies greatly, from this grain being sown on land
                    of every quality, may be stated generally at about five quarters per acre. They
                    are often carried to the barn like hay, without being tied up in sheaves; but in
                    the north they are either managed in the way already described for wheat, or set
                    up in single sheaves or <hi rend="italic">gaits</hi> as they are cut, and tied
                    more tightly when ready to be carried, and then built in the stack-yard.
                    Wherever a threshing-mill is employed, as it is necessary, in order to have the
                    work done well, that corn should be presented to the rollers in a regular,
                    uniform manner, the practice of mowing, and carrying it in a loose state, is
                    highly improper; and, independently of this objection, the season often
                    occasions much damage to coin managed in this slovenly manner, which it would
                    have escaped in sheaves and covered shocks.</p>
                <p>The straw of oats is of more value as fodder than that of any other corn crop,
                    and it is advantageously used as a substitute for hay during the winter months
                    in some of the best cultivated districts, both for farm-horses and cattle. »</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Peas and Beans.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the introduction of clover and turnips, the culture of peas, which are
                    almost everywhere a most precarious crop, has been greatly diminished. Their
                    straw or haulm is sometimes more valuable than the grain produce, which, in a
                    wet or late season, is frequently little more than the seed; and when the straw
                    is not luxuriant, so much of the land is left exposed to the growth of weeds,
                    that it is rendered unfit for carrying corn crops till cleansed by a fallow or
                    fallow crop. Drilling is but an ineffectual remedy for these inconveniences, the
                    stems falling over and covering the ground in so irregular a manner as in a
                    great measure to prevent either horse or hand-hoeing at the time when it would
                    be most beneficial. Yet a luxuriant crop of peas, by completely covering the
                    surface, keeping the soil in a moist and mellow state, and preventing the growth
                    of weeds, is a good preparation for either wheat or barley.</p>
                <p>The culture of beans is almost confined to clays and strong loams in the best
                    managed districts, turnip soils being by no means suited to this crop. Beans
                    usually <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> succeed wheat or oats, but sometimes also
                    clover or pasture grass. The common horse-bean is the kind most generally
                    cultivated; but large and small <hi rend="italic">ticks</hi> are preferred in
                    some of the English counties.</p>
                <p>Beans, though still sown <hi rend="italic">broad-cast</hi> in several places, and
                    sometimes <hi rend="italic">dibbled,</hi> are for the most part drilled by
                    judicious cultivators, or deposited after the plough in every furrow, or only in
                    every second or third furrow. In the latter method, the crop rises in rows, at
                    regular intervals of 9, 18, or 27 inches, and the hand-hoe ought invariably to
                    be employed; but it is only where the widest interval is adopted that the
                    horse-hoe can be used with much effect in their subsequent culture.</p>
                <p>In the preparation of the land, much depends on the nature of the soil and the
                    state of the weather; for as beans must be sown early in the spring, it is
                    sometimes impossible to give it all the labour which a careful farmer would wish
                    to bestow. It must also be regulated in some measure by the manner of sowing.
                    But as we are decidedly of opinion that beans ought in general to be planted
                    with such a distance between the rows as to admit of horse-hoeing, we shall
                    confine ourselves to this mode of culture, which we think should be generally
                    known, making use of the latest publication on the subject, which contains an
                    accurate account of the different operations. <hi rend="italic">{General Report
                    of Scotland,</hi> vol. i. p. 515.)</p>
                <p>In preparing ground for beans, it ought to be ploughed with a deep furrow after
                    harvest or early in winter; and as two ploughings in spring are highly
                    advantageous, the winter furrow may be given in the direction of the former
                    ridges, in which way the land is sooner dry in spring than if it had been
                    ploughed across. The second ploughing is to be given across the ridges, as early
                    in spring as the ground is sufficiently dry; and the third furrow either forms
                    the drills or receives the seed, as shall be mentioned immediately.</p>
                <p>Dung is often applied to the bean crop, especially if it succeeds wheat. By some,
                    dung is spread on the stubble previous to the winter ploughing; but this cannot
                    always be done in a satisfactory manner, at least in the northern parts of the
                    island, unless during frost, when it may lie long exposed to the weather before
                    it can be turned down by the plough. The most desirable mode therefore is, to
                    lay the manure into drills immediately before the beans are sown.</p>
                <p>There are, as already hinted, two several modes of drilling beans. In one of
                    these, the lands or ridges are divided by the plough into ridgelets or <hi
                    rend="italic">one-bout</hi> stitches, at intervals of about 27 inches. If dung
                    is to be applied, the seed ought first to be deposited, as it is found
                    inconvenient to run the drill-machine afterwards. The dung may then be drawn out
                    from the carts in small heaps, one row of heaps serving for three or five
                    ridgelets; and it is evenly spread, and equally divided among them, in a way
                    that will be more minutely described when treating of the culture of turnips.
                    The ridgelets are next split out or reversed, either by means of the common
                    plough or one with two mould-boards, which covers both the seed and the manure
                    in the most perfect manner.</p>
                <p>When beans are sown by the other method, in the bottom of a common furrow, the
                    dung must be previously spread over the surface of the winter or spring
                    ploughing. Three ploughs then start in succession, one immediately behind
                    another, and a drill-barrow either follows the third plough, or is attached to
                    it, by which the beans are sown in every third furrow, or at from 24 to 27
                    inches asunder, according to the breadth of the furrow-slice.</p>
                <p>Another approved way of sowing beans, when dung is applied at seed-time, is to
                    spread the dung, and to plough it down with a strong furrow; after which shallow
                    furrows'are drawn, into which the seed is deposited by the drill-machine.
                    Whichever of these modes of sowing is followed, the whole field must be
                    carefully laid dry by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033501"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3501-0284"/>means of channels formed by the plough, and when
                    necessary by the shovel; for neither then nor at any former period should water
                    be allowed to stagnate on the land.</p>
                <p>The time of sowing beans is as early as possible after the severity of winter is
                    over; in the south sometimes in January, but never later than the end of March,
                    as the ripening of the crop and its safe harvesting would otherwise be very
                    precarious in this climate.</p>
                <p>’ The quantity of seed allowed is very different in the southern and northern
                    parts of Britain; in the former, even when the rows are narrow, only two bushels
                    or two bushels and a half; but in Scotland seldom less than four bushels to the
                    English statute acre, even when sown in ridgelets 27 inches distant, and a
                    bushel more when sown <hi rend="italic">broad-cast.</hi></p>
                <p>- Both in the broad-cast and drill husbandry it is common to mix a small quantity
                    of peas along with beans. This mixture improves both the quantity and quality of
                    the straw for fodder; and the peas-straw is useful for binding up the sheaves in
                    harvest.</p>
                <p>. <hi rend="superscript">:</hi> The bean crop is generally harrowed to destroy
                    annual weeds; sometimes just before the plants make their appearance, and
                    sometimes after the beans have got their first green leaves, and are fairly
                    above ground. When so&amp;n in rows in either of the ’ modes already mentioned;
                    the harrows are employed about ten or twelve days after; and, being driven
                    across the ridgelets, the land is laid completely level for the subsequent
                    operations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> After the beans have made some growth, sooner or
                    later, according as the soil may happen to be encumbered with or free from
                    weeds, the horse-hoe-is employed in the interval between the rows, and followed
                    by the hand-hoe for the purpose of cutting down such weeds as the horse-hoe
                    canħot reach: all the weeds that grow among the beans beyond the reach of either
                    hoe should be pulled up with the hand. ∙ ’ ∙The same operations are repeated as
                    often as the condition of the land in regard to cleanness may require!</p>
                <p>’ Before the introduction of the horse-hoe, which merely stirs the soil, and
                    .cuts up the weeds, a common small plough, drawn by one horse, was used in
                    working between the <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> rows, and is still necessary
                    where root-weeds abound. This plough goes one bout, or up and down in each
                    interval, turning the earth from the beans, and forming a ridgelet in the
                    middle: then hand-hoes arc immediately employed; and after some time a second
                    hand-hoeing succeeds, to destroy any fresh growth of weeds. The same plough,
                    with an additional mould-board, finally splits open the intermediate ridgelet,
                    and lays up the earth to the roots of the beans on each side. The benefit of
                    laying up the earth in this manner, however, is alleged to be counterbalanced by
                    the trouble which it occasions in harvest, when it is difficult to get the
                    reapers to cut low enough, and may be properly dispensed with, unless the soil
                    be very wet and level.</p>
                <p>In an early harvest, and when the straw is not immoderately rank, the bean crop
                    becomes ripe in good time, and is easily prepared for the stack-yard. But in
                    moist warm seasons the grain hardly ever ripens effectually, and it is
                    exceedingly difficult to get the straw into a proper condition for the stack. In
                    such cases it has been found of advantage to switch off the succulent tops with
                    an old scythe* blade set in a wooden handle, with which one man can easily
                    top-dress two acres a day. This operation, it is said, will occasion the crop to
                    be ready for reaping a fortnight earlier, and also perhaps a week sooner ready
                    for the stack-yard after being reaped. In order to have the land prepared for a
                    wheat crop, beans arc sometimes removed from the ground, and set up to dry in
                    another field-</p>
                <p>The most approved mode of reaping beans is with the sickle, but they arc
                    sometimes mown, and in a few instances even pulled up by the roots. They should
                    be cut as near the ground as possible, for the sake of the straw, which is of
                    considerable value as fodder, and because the best pods are often placed on the
                    stems near the roots. They are then left for a few days to wither, and
                    afterwards bound and set up in the shock to dry, but without any
                    head-sheaves.</p>
                <p>Beans are built in circular or oblong stacks, often in the latter form; and it is
                    always proper, if the stack be large, to construct one or more funnels, to allow
                    a free circulation of air. They may be threshed by the mill, and dressed by the
                    winnowing-machinc, like any other grain.</p>
                <p>The produce of beans, like that of other pulse crops, is exceedingly precarious,
                    and probably does not exceed: upon an average three quarters per acre. That of
                    peas, as we have observed, is still more uncertain. But the haulm of both is
                    valuable in the feeding of live stock; and the bean crop comes in on clay soils
                    as a preparative for wheat, thus postponing the recurrence of a naked fallow.
                    The consumption of peas and beans is chiefly in the feeding of horses and hogs;
                    but the proportion in which the former is grown in the best courses of husbandry
                    is comparatively inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>In the neighbourhood of London and some other large towns, varieties of the pea
                    are cultivated for supplying green peas at an early period of the season, which
                    at that timtí bring a very high price; but this belongs to gardening rather than
                    to agriculture.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Tares.</hi></p>
                <p>The tare, though cultivated for its stems and leaves rather than for its fruit or
                    seeds, is so similar to the pea in its habits and mode of culture, that it seems
                    proper to mention it in this place.</p>
                <p>The common tare is distinguished into two sorts, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >winter</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spring</hi> tare. It is the opinion of an
                    eminent botanist that they are the same plant (Walker’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hebrides,</hi> vol. i. p. 228); but though this may have been true of the tare
                    in its natural state, there is reason to believe that a material difference now.
                    exists, superinduced perhaps by cultivation. <hi rend="italic">{Annals of
                    Agriculture,</hi> vol. ii.) The winter tare, by the experiments detailed in the
                    work just referred to, escaped injury from frosts whiclι destroyed the spring
                    variety. The difference in the colour and size of the seeds is, however, so
                    inconsiderable as to be scarcely ∙ distinguished; but “the winter tare vegetates
                    with a seed leaf of a fresh green colour, whereas the spring <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> tare comes up with a grassy spear of a brown dusky
                    hue.” (Dickson’s <hi rend="italic">Practical Agriculture,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    889.)</p>
                <p>The winter variety is sown in September and October, and the first sowing in
                    spring ought to be as early as the season will permit. If they are to be cut
                    green for soiling throughout the summer and autumn, which is the most
                    advantageous method of consuming them, successive sowings should follow till the
                    end of May. The quantity of seed to an acre is from 2½ to 3½ bushels, according
                    to the time of sowing, and as they are to be consumed green or left to stand for
                    a crop.</p>
                <p>Tares are· in some places eaten on the ground by different kinds of live stock,
                    particularly by sheep; and as the winter-sown variety comes very early in
                    spring, the value of this rich food is then very considerable. The waste,
                    however, in this way, even though the sheep be confined in hurdles, must be
                    great; and still greater when consumed by horses or cattle. But if the plants be
                    cut green, and given to live stock either on the field or in the fold-yards,
                    there is, perhaps, no green crop of greater <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033514"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3514-0285"/>value, nor any better calculated to give a
                    succession of herbage from May to November. The winter-sown tare, in a
                    favourable climate, is ready for cutting before clover; the first spring crop
                    comes in after the clover must be all consumed or made into hay; and the
                    successive spring sowings give a produce more nourishing for the larger animals
                    than the aftermath of clover, and may afford green food at least a month
                    longer.</p>
                <p>A little rye sown with winter tares, and a few oats with the spring sort, not
                    only serve to support the weak creeping stems of the tares, but add to the bulk
                    of the crop by growing up through the interstices.</p>
                <p>There is little difference in the culture of tares and of peas; they are often
                    sown broad-cast, but sometimes in rows, with intervals to admit of hand-hoeing.
                    The land ought to be rolled as a preparation for mowing; and they should always
                    be cut with the scythe rather than with a sickle, which, by tearing up a number
                    of the plants by the roots, renders the second growth of little or no value.
                    When cut with the scythe, even an early spring-sown crop sometimes yields a
                    tolerable after-crop.</p>
                <p>In those districts where winter-sown tares are found to succeed, which is not the
                    case in the north, the ground may be cleared in time for being sown with
                    turnips, or dressed like a fallow for wheat to be sown in autumn.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Potatoes.</hi></p>
                <p>The varieties of this root are so numerous, that it would be hardly possible to
                    give the names of them all. They differ not only in quality,' being more or less
                    farinaceous, but in the appearance of their leaves, haulm, and flowers, and in
                    their time of ripening, as well as in the colour of the roots. Among those most
                    commonly grown in the fields, the latter is the most obvious distinction. They
                    are either of a white or of a purple colour approaching to black; the former
                    being in most repute during the early months of winter, and the latter in the
                    spring and summer months. The kind most generally cultivated round London is the
                    early champion, which is very hardy, prolific, and farinaceous. The yam or
                    Surinam potato, the oxnoble, and the late champion/ are grown exclusively for
                    live stock. New varieties may be easily obtained from the seed contained in the
                    apple. The earlier varieties, indeed,“do not usually carry any flower; but by
                    removing the earth from the roots,' and the small potatoes themselves as they
                    began to form, Mr Knight, the president of the Horticultural Society, succeeded
                    in forcing the plant into blossom, and thus obtained seeds from the early as
                    well as the common kinds.</p>
                <p>The potato is planted in almost every description of soil, but thrives best in
                    one that is somewhat loose and porous. In many parts of Ireland it is the
                    practice to plant them upon what are called lazy-beds, the sets being placed
                    upon the surface and covered with earth taken out of a trench formed around
                    them.</p>
                <p>Under the best management, the land is prepared for the potato much in the same
                    manner as for the turnip. It is of much importance to free it. as completely as
                    possible from weed-roots, which cannot be so well extirpated afterwards, as in
                    the culture of turnips and other drilled crops, both because the horse-hoe must
                    be excluded altogether at a time when vegetation is still vigorous, and because
                    at no period of their growth is it safe to work so near the plants, especially
                    after they have made some progress in growth. It is the earlier time of planting
                    and of finishing the after-culture that renders potatoes a very indifferent
                    substitute for fallow, and, in this respect, in no degree comparable to turnips.
                    For this reason, as well as on account of the great quantity of manure required,
                    their small value at a distance from large towns, and the great expense of
                    transporting so bulky a commodity, the culture of potatoes is by no means
                    extensive in the best-managed districts. Unless in the immediate vicinity of
                    such towns, or in very populous manufacturing counties, potatoes do not
                    constitute a regular rotation crop, though' they are raised almost everywhere
                    to-the extent required for the consumption of the farmer and his servants, and
                    in some cases for occasionally feeding horses and cattle, particularly late in
                    spring.</p>
                <p>The first ploughing is given soon after harvest, and a second, and commonly a
                    third, early in spring. The land is then laid up into ridgelets from 27 to 30
                    inches broad, as for turnips, and manured in the same manner. The usual season
                    of planting potatoes in the fields is April, but it frequently continues till
                    the middle of May. A week or two before the planting begins, the roots are cut
                    into pieces or sets, each having at least one <hi rend="italic">eye</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> what is called the <hi rend="italic">nose-end</hi> of the
                    root being the most valuable for this purpose.“Under the drill system the sets
                    are placed in the bottom of the furrow, between the ridgelets, at from four to
                    eight inches distance, and the ridgelets then reversed to cover them. But in
                    some places they are still planted after the plough, commonly in every third
                    furrow; by which means they rise in rows, at much the same distance as in the
                    former case, and admit of nearly the same after-culture. In either case the land
                    remains untouched till the tops of the plants begin to rise above the surface,
                    when it is usual to harrow slightly across the ridges; and afterwards the
                    horse-hoe or small hoeing-plough and the hand-hoe are repeatedly employed in the
                    intervals and between the plants, as long as the progress of the crop will
                    permit, or the state of the soil may require. The earth is then gathered once or
                    oftener, from the middle of the intervals towards the roots of the plants, after
                    which any weeds that may be left must be drawn out by hand; for when the
                    radicles have extended far in search of food, and the young; roots begin to
                    form, neither the horse nor hand-hoc can be admitted without injury.</p>
                <p>Potatoés are usually taken up with the common plough, but sometimes with
                    three-pronged forks: the plough goes, twice along each ridgelet, in . such a
                    manner as not materially to injure any of the roots with its share or coulter,
                    and the potatoes are gathered by women and children placed along the line at
                    proper distances. When the land is somewhat moist, or of a tenacious quality,
                    the furrow-slice does not give out the roots freely, and a harrow, which follows
                    the plough, is commonly employed to break it and. separate them from the mould.
                    Various contrivances have been resorted to for this purpose: a circular harrow
                    or brake to be attached to the plough (see Plate VII.) has been found to answer
                    the purpose well, and to effect a considerable saving of labour.</p>
                <p>Various suggestions have been offered for the purpose of improving the
                    cultivation of this root. Instead of cutting the roots to be planted into sets,
                    some have recommended the planting of them whole, and others have thought that a
                    great saving of the root might be made by scooping out the sets. See Plate X.
                    Several experiments have been made to augment the produce and accelerate the
                    ripening of potatoes, by plucking off the blossoms from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >shaws</hi> or haulm. But none of these innovations has yet entered into general
                    practice, and the trials have not been so numerous nor so satisfactory as to
                    warrant any conclusions of real utility.</p>
                <p>The potato crop is preserved through winter, sometimes in houses, but more
                    generally perhaps in some convenient place near the farm-buildings, in <hi
                    rend="italic">camps, ]nes,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pits,</hi> covered first
                    with straw, and then with earth dug up <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033527"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3527-0286"/>around the heaps in the form of a trench, which
                    discharges any water that might otherwise lodge about the bottoms.</p>
                <p>The produce per acre may vary from five or six to ten or twelve tons; but the
                    average, perhaps, cannot be stated at more than six or seven. The potato is for
                    the most part consumed after no other preparation than boiling or roasting, and
                    unfortunately it is not fit for being stored up and kept over from one year to
                    another. To make it more generally useful, it has been recommended to convert
                    its farinaceous matter into flour, in which state, if well dried and closely
                    packed, it maybe preserved for several years. Its flour has been recommended·
                    for a variety of culinary preparations, and is said to be often used in place of
                    arrow-root in the medical treatment of patients in the hospitals of the
                    Continent. Ardent spirits have also been obtained from potatoes, even after they
                    had been so injured by frost as to be useless for any other purpose. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Farmer’s Magazine,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 325.)</p>
                <p>The curl is the most destructive disease to which this plant is liable; and the
                    only preventive hitherto known is a change of seed or sets. It is a prevailing
                    opinion that it is occasioned by the over-ripeness of the plants used as seed;
                    and it is therefore the practice to take up what is intended for seed some weeks
                    before they are fully ripe. Others prefer bringing their seed from a colder
                    situation, the success of the change probably depending upon the circumstance of
                    the roots not being fully ripened.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Turnips.</hi></p>
                <p>Turnips and clover are the two main pillars of the best courses of British
                    husbandry. They have contributed more to preserve and augment the fertility of
                    the soil for producing grain, to enlarge and improve our breeds of cattle and
                    sheep, and to furnish a regular supply of butchermeat all the year, than any
                    other crops; and they will probably be long found vastly superior, for extensive
                    cultivation, to any of the rivals which have often been opposed to them in
                    particular situations.</p>
                <p>Turnips cannot be advantageously cultivated on wet, tenacious clays, but are
                    grown on all comparatively dry soils, under all the variations of our climate.
                    On dry loams, and all soils of a looser texture, managed according to the best
                    courses of cropping, they enter into the rotation to the extent of a fourth, a
                    sixth, or an eighth part of the land in tillage; and even on clayey soils they
                    are frequently cultivated, though on a smaller scale, to be eaten by cattle, for
                    the purpose of augmenting and enriching the manure into which the straw of corn
                    is converted.</p>
                <p>It will be sufficient in this place to describe the practices of the best managed
                    counties of Scotland in regard to the culture of turnips, which are universally
                    raised in rows at such a distance as to admit of horse-hoeing; and every step of
                    the process is conducted with much accuracy and success.</p>
                <p>The varieties commonly cultivated by the best farmers are, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >white globe,</hi> which comes early and gives a very weighty crop, but often
                    suffers much from the frosts of winter; the <hi rend="italic">yellow,</hi> which
                    is more hardy, and answers well for succeeding the <hi rend="italic">globe</hi>
                    in spring·; and the <hi rend="italic">ruta baga,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Swedish,</hi> which may be preserved for consumption till the end of May.</p>
                <p>The drill culture of turnips was first firmly established in Scotland by the
                    practice of Mr William Dawson, a farmer at Frogden, in the county of Roxburgh,
                    soon after his entry to that farm in 1759. Turnips had.,been sown indeed on
                    narrow ridges, according to the practice of Tull, many yearebefore that period;
                    but chiefly by .proprietors, upon a very small scale; and the several operations
                    were neither so correct, so uniform, nor so much simplified as to induce general
                    imitation. The first person who ever formed turnip ridges in Scotland with a
                    two-horse plough without a driver was instructed by Mr Dawson, and died only a
                    few years ago.</p>
                <p>In the drill culture of turnips, the land is ploughed with a deep furrow soon
                    after harvest, usually in the direction of the former ridges, though, if the
                    soil be dry, it is of little consequence in what direction. As soon as the
                    spring seed-time is over, a second ploughing is given across the former, and the
                    harrows, and, if necessary, the rollers, are then set to work to clean and
                    pulverize the soil. All the weed-roots that are brought to the surface are
                    carefully gathered into heaps, and either burnt on the ground, or carried off to
                    form a compost, usually with lime. The land is then generally ploughed a third
                    time, again harrowed well, sometimes also rolled, and the weedroots picked out
                    as before. Unless land is in a much worse state, in regard to cleanness and
                    pulverization, than it usually is after turnips have been for some time a
                    rotation crop, no more ploughings are necessary. It is next laid up in ridgelets
                    from 27 to 30 inches wide, either with the common swing-plough, or one with two
                    mould-boards, which forms two sides of a ridgelet at once. Well-rotted dung, at
                    the rate of 12 or 15 tons per acre, is then carried to the field, and dropt from
                    the cart in the middle one of three intervals, in such a quantity as may serve
                    for that and the interval on each side of it. The dung is then divided equally
                    among the three by a person who goes before the spreaders, one of whom for each
                    interval spreads it with a small three-pronged fork along the bottom. The plough
                    immediately follows, and, reversing the ridgelets, forms new ones over the dung;
                    and the drill-barrow, commonly one that sows two drills at once, drawn by one
                    horse, deposits the seed as fast as the new drills are formed. This drill
                    machine is usually furnished with two small rollers; one that goes before the
                    sowing apparatus, and levels the pointed tops of the ridgelets, and another that
                    follows for the purpose of compressing the soil and covering the seed. From the
                    time the dung is carted to the ground, until the seed is deposited, the several
                    operations should go on simultaneously: the dung is never allowed to lie
                    uncovered to be dried by the sun and the wind; and the new ridgelets are sown as
                    soon as formed, that the seed may find moisture to accelerate its
                    vegetation.</p>
                <p>The time of sowing the several varieties is somewhat different; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Swedish</hi> should be put in the earliest, and then the <hi
                    rend="italic">yellow,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> both of them in the month of
                    May. But as these kinds are much less extensively cultivated than the <hi
                    rend="italic">globe,</hi> the month of June is the principal seedtime; and after
                    the first week of July a full crop is not to be expected in the northern parts
                    of the island. The quantity of seed most commonly allowed is two pounds to the
                    acre, which, though much more than sufficient to stock the ground with plants,
                    is thought to be necessary for insuring a regular crop on most soils. The
                    supernumerary plants are. easily taken out with the hoe; but if any parts are
                    missed, they can be filled up only by inserting a few Swedish plants: the other
                    varieties seldom succeed after transplantation.</p>
                <p>As soon as the plants have put forth the <hi rend="italic">rough leaf,</hi> or
                    sooner if annual weeds have got the start of them, a horse-hoe is run between
                    the ridgelets, which cuts up the weeds on each side, almost close to the rows of
                    the turnip plants, clearing out the bottom of the interval at the same time. The
                    hand-hoers are always set to work as soon after, as possible, and the plants are
                    left about nine inches <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033540"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3540-0287"/>distant—the Swedish kind somewhat closer. If the
                    ground has been-well prepared, and the plants not allowed to get too large,
                    three experienced hoers go over an acre a day. A few days after this a small
                    swing-plough, drawn by one horse, enters the interval between the rows, and,
                    taking a furrow-slice off each side, forms a smaller ridgelet in the middle. If
                    the annuals still rise in great abundance, the horse-hoe may be employed again,
                    otherwise the next operation is to go over them a second time with the handhoe,
                    when the intermediate ridgelet is levelled. Sometimes a third hoeing must be
                    given; but that is done very expeditiously. When no more manual labour is
                    required, a small plough with two mould-boards is employed to lay up the earth
                    to the sides of the plants, leaving the ridgelets of the same form as when sown,
                    which finishes the process. Large fields, dressed in this manner throughout
                    their whole extent, are left as clean and as pleasant to the eye as the best
                    cultivated garden. The horse and hand-hoeing in ordinary cases may cost about
                    fifteen shillings per acre.</p>
                <p>Where the soil is perfectly dry, and has been well prepared, the small plough has
                    of late been laid aside by many farmers, and the space between the rows is kept
                    clean by the horse and hand-hoe alone; but if the soil be either wet from
                    springs, or so flat as not easily to part with surface water, it is still
                    considered proper to earth up the roots as the concluding part of the process;
                    and it is always useful to plough between the ridges when couchgrass and other
                    weeds have not been completely picked out before the land was sown.</p>
                <p>The gathering of the weeds, the spreading of the dung, and the hand-hoeing, are
                    almost always performed by women and boys and girls.</p>
                <p>A good crop of white globe turnips weighs from 25 to 30 tons per acre, the yellow
                    and Swedish commonly a few tons less. Of late there have been instances of much
                    heavier crops; and in Ayrshire it would appear that above 60 tons have been
                    raised on an English acre, the leaves not included. <hi rend="italic">(Farmers
                    Magazine,</hi> vol. xv. and xvi.) But such an extraordinary produce must have
                    been obtained by the application of more manure than can be provided, without
                    injustice to other crops, from the home resources of a farm; and where turnips
                    form a regular crop in the rotation, no such produce is to be expected under any
                    mode of culture.</p>
                <p>Turnips are consumed either on the spot where they grow, on grass fields, in
                    fold-yards, or in feeding-houses; the far greater part, wherever they are
                    extensively cultivated, by sheep. The price per acre when sold depends not only
                    upon the weight of the crop, but also on the mode of its consumption.</p>
                <p>When eaten by sheep in the place of their growth, turnips are lotted off, by
                    means of hurdles or nets, that they may be regularly consumed. When the first
                    allowance is nearly eaten up, the bottoms or shells are picked out of the ground
                    by means of a two-prönged blunt hook adapted to the purpose; and then another
                    portion of the field is taken in, by shifting the hurdles or nets; and so on
                    regularly until the whole are finished; the cleared part of the field being
                    usually left accessible as a drier bed for the sheep, and that they may pick up
                    the shells that remained when a new portion of the field was taken in.</p>
                <p>The turnips required for other modes of consumption are usually drawn out at
                    regular intervals before the sheep are put upon the field; unless the soil be so
                    poor as to need all the benefit of their dung and treading, in which case the
                    whole are consumed where they grow; or so rich as to endanger the succeeding
                    crops, by eating any part of the turnips on the ground. In the latter very rare
                    instance, the whole crop is carried to be consumed elsewhere, as must always be
                    done if the soil be naturally too wet for sheep feeding.</p>
                <p>In wet weather, when sheep ought not to be allowed to lie on the turnip field, it
                    becomes necessary to carry the turnips to a grass field; and store sheep, not
                    requiring to be so highly fed, frequently eat their turnips on such fields, as
                    well as rearing cattle, and sometimes milch cows. A grass field contiguous to
                    the turnip one is always very desirable, that the sheep, confined on other sides
                    by hurdles or nets, may always find a dry place to lie on.</p>
                <p>In the distribution of turnips among young cattle, and sheep in their first year,
                    towards spring, when the loosening and shedding of their teeth render them
                    unable to break the hard roots, it is usual to cut or slice the turnip, either
                    by means of a spade or chopping-knife, or by an implement constructed for the
                    purpose, called a turnipslicer, formerly mentioned; or they are crushed by means
                    of a heavy wooden mallet.</p>
                <p>During severe frosts, turnips become so hard that no animal is able to bite them.
                    The best remedy in this case is, to lay them for some time in running water,
                    which effectually thaws them; or, in close feeding-houses, the turnips intended
                    for next day’s use may be stored up over night in one end of the building, and
                    the warmth of the animals will thaw them sufficiently before morning. But in
                    those months when frosts are usually most severe, it is advisable to have always
                    a few days’ consumption in the turnip-barn, formerly mentioned. When a severe
                    frost continues long, or if the ground be covered deep with snow, potatoes ought
                    to be employed as a substitute.</p>
                <p>The advantages of eating turnips on the place of their growth by sheep, both in
                    manuring and consolidating the ground, are sufficiently well known to every
                    farmer. One great defect of the inferior sort of turnip soils is the want of
                    tenacity; and it is found that valuable crops of wheat may be obtained upon very
                    light, porous soils, after turnips so consumed.</p>
                <p>The value or price by the acre is so various, from differences in soil and
                    seasons, and fluctuates so much according to the degree of abundance and demand,
                    that nothing can be decisively stated on this subject. It likewise varies
                    according to the modes of application, as above noticed. A farmer who has
                    turnips to sell will demand more money per acre, if they are to be drawn and
                    consumed by the purchaser in the fold-yard, or on the pastures of the farm, than
                    if eaten by sheep where they grow; and will require a much higher price if they
                    are· to be carried off’ the farm. Indeed, hardly any price will compensate for
                    such abstraction of manure, and consequent loss of future fertility, unless
                    where manure can be readily purchased to supply the defalcation; and that can
                    only be done by those who are situated near towns and large villages, where a
                    few turnips may be sold in that way for the cows of the inhabitants. Eight
                    guineas an acre is considered a good price, in seasons of uncommon demand, for a
                    full crop; five guineas in ordinary years; and down to thirty and forty
                    shillings for inferior crops. Upon an average of years, five guineas may be
                    reckoned a fair price for a good crop, eaten by sheep where they grow. Near
                    large towns, where turnips are in demand by cowfeeders, they will sell in
                    ordinary years for double, and when in extraordinary demand, for three or even
                    four times these prices; but in these cases they are always removed from the
                    farm, and consequently the manure which they produce is lost to the soil.</p>
                <p>It is not uncommon to let turnips at an agreed price, or board, for each sheep or
                    beast weekly. This varies, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033553"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3553-0288"/>according to’age and size and the state of the
                    demand, from fourpence or less to eightpence or more for each sheep weekly, and
                    from two shillings to five for each beast. An acre of good turnips, say 30 tons,
                    with straw, will fatten an ox of 60 stone, or 10 Leicester sheep. Supposing the
                    turnips worth six guineas, this may bring the weekly keep of the ox to 6s. 3½d.
                    and of the sheep to about '7½d. a week. In this way of letting, however,
                    disputes may arise, as the taker may not be careful to have them eaten up
                    clean.</p>
                <p>The person who lets the turnips has to maintain a herd for the taker; and when
                    let for cattle, and consequently to be carried off, the taker finds a man and
                    horse, and the letter maintains both. The taker has to provide hurdles or nets
                    for fencing the allotments to sheep, but the letter must fence his own hedges if
                    necessary. The period at which the taker is to consume the whole is usually
                    fixed in the agreement, that the letter maybe enabled to plough and sow his
                    land½n proper season.</p>
                <p>Common turnips are seldom stored in any great quantity, though sometimes a
                    portion is drawn and formed into heaps like potato camps, and lightly covered
                    with straw, or preserved for some time under a shed. On these occasions the
                    shaws or leaves and the tap-roots must be cut off and removed before storing up,
                    to prevent heating and rotting. The heaps must not be covered with earth like
                    potatoes, for in this case their complete destruction is inevitable. This root
                    contains too much water to. be preserved for any length of time in a fresh and
                    palatable state after being removed from the ground; and though the loss in
                    seasons unusually severe, particularly in the <hi rend="italic">white globe</hi>
                    variety, is commonly very great, it is probable that a regular system of storing
                    the whole, or the greater part of the crop every season, would upon an average
                    of years be attended with still greater loss; besides, the labour and expense,
                    where turnips are cultivated extensively, would be intolerable. Yet it has
                    become a practice in some parts, particularly in Norfolk, to preserve a portion
                    of the turnip crop through the winter, by what is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >placing.</hi> They arc removed from the field where they grow, and the
                    tap-roots being taken off, the bulbs, with the haulm on, are placed close
                    together in the position in which they grew, upon some dry, sheltered spot near
                    the farm-houses, where they are ready for use as wanted; and in this way, with
                    little or no artificial shelter, they are found to keep in a fresh state longer
                    than if they had been left in the field.</p>
                <p>Besides the damage sustained by a turnip crop from beetles and other insects, a
                    very destructive disease, formerly confined to particular districts, has lately
                    begun to extend itself in an alarming manner; and there is reason to fear, if
                    some means of prevention be not soon discovered, that it may almost put an end
                    to the cultivation of this root, in some situations where it is of essential
                    importance, both with a view to the produce of grain and to the rearing and
                    fattening of live stock. In Holderness it is known by the quaint name of <hi
                    rend="italic">fingers and toes,</hi> from the shapes into which the disease
                    distorts either the bulb or tap-root, or frequently both. An ingenious paper on
                    this subject was read to the Holderness Agricultural Society in 1811, by Mr
                    William Spence, their president, from which we shall abstract some account of
                    this hitherto local disease.</p>
                <p>In some plants the bulb itself is split into several finger-diverging lobes. More
                    frequently the bulb is, externally, tolerably perfect, and the tap-root is the
                    part principally diseased, being either wholly metamorphosed into a sort of
                    mis-shapen secondary bulb, often larger than the real bulb, and closely attached
                    to it, or having excrescences of various shapes, frequently not unlike human
                    toes (whence the name of the disease), either springing immediately from its
                    sides or from the fibrous roots that issue from it. In this last case each fibre
                    often swells into several knobs, so as distantly to resemble the wire and
                    accompanying tubers of a potato; and not seldom one turnip will exhibit a
                    combination of all these different forms of the disease. These distortions
                    manifest themselves at a very early stage of the turnip’s growth; and plants
                    scarcely in the rough leaf will exhibit excrescences, which differ in nothing
                    else than size from those of the full-grown root.</p>
                <p>The leaves discover no unusual appearance, except that in hot weather they become
                    flaccid and droop; from which symptom the presence of the disease may be
                    surmised without examining the roots. These continue to grow for some months,
                    but without attaining any considerable size, the excrescences enlarging at the
                    same time. If divided at this period with a knife, both the bulb and the
                    excrescences are found to be perfectly solid, and internally to differ little in
                    appearance from a healthy root, except that they are of a more mealy and less
                    compact consistence, and are interspersed with more numerous and larger
                    sap-vessels. The taste, too, is more acrid; and on this account sheep neglect
                    the diseased plants. Towards the approach of autumn, the roots, in proportion as
                    they are more or less diseased, become gangrenous and rot, and are either broken
                    (as frequently happens) by high winds, or gradually dissolved by the rain. Some
                    which have been partially diseased survive the winter; but of the rest at this
                    period, no other vestige remains than the vacant patches which they occupied at
                    their first appearance.</p>
                <p>This disease, according to Mr Spence, is not owing to the seed, nor to the time
                    of sowing, nor to any qualityorthe soil, either original, or induced by any
                    particular mode of cropping or of tillage; and he adds, “that the most attentive
                    and unbiassed consideration of the facts has led him to infer that the disease,
                    though not produced by any insect that has yet been discovered, is yet caused by
                    some unobserved species, which, either biting the turnip in the earliest stage
                    of its growth, or insinuating its egg into it, infuses at the same time into the
                    wound a liquid, which communicates to the sap-vessels a morbid action, causing
                    them to form the excrescences in question.”</p>
                <p>With regard to the prevention of this disease, mari has been recommended by Sir
                    Joseph Banks and others; and where marl cannot be procured, it has been thought
                    that an addition of mould of any kind that has not borne turnips will be
                    advantageous; such as a dressing taken from banks, headlands, ditches, &amp;c.
                    and mixed up with a good dose of lime. But lime alone has been tried in vain;
                    and no great dependence can be placed upon fresh mould, as this disease has been
                    known to prevail upon lands that had scarcely ever before borne a crop of
                    turnips. <hi rend="italic">{Farmer’s Magazine,</hi> vol. xiii.)</p>

                <p>The mangold wurzel, or field-beet, is cultivated in muelv the same manner as
                    turnip, and used in the same way in the feeding of live stock. It has been long
                    grown in Germany, Switzerland, and other parts of the Continent, but has been
                    but recently introduced into Britain, and is still cultivated here only upon a
                    small scale. Very heavy crops have been raised upon clay; a circumstance which
                    is alleged to be in favour of introducing it into the general rotation; but the
                    same thing is true of turnip, the difficulty consisting not in the productive
                    power of such a soil, but in its preparation and the carrying away of the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193033566" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3566-0289"/> crop. As the
                    sowing of mangold wurzel should not be deferred beyond the middle of April, it
                    must rarely be practicable to have heavy land in a suitable condition so early.
                    Like the Swedish turnip, however, it admits of being transplanted, which may be
                    done in May, so as to give more time for preparing the soil.</p>
                <p>The produce in ordinary cases is much the same as that of the Swedish turnip, but
                    it is understood to contain a greater proportion of nutritive matter. Near
                    London it is in much repute for the feeding of milch cows. The tops are taken
                    off' first and given by themselves; and afterwards the roots, which are more
                    liable to be injured by frost than the Swedish turnip.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Carrots.</hi></p>
                <p>This crop, it is well known, requires a deep soil, inclining to sand, and cannot
                    therefore be so generally cultivated as turnips. But it has been too much
                    neglected on lands where it would have yielded a more valuable product, perhaps,
                    than any bulbous or tap-rooted plant whatever. Several contradictory experiments
                    in its culture have been detailed in a number of publications, from which the
                    practical husbandman will be at a loss to draw any definite conclusion. But in a
                    communication to the Board of Agriculture, from Mr Robert Burrows, an
                    intelligent Norfolk farmer, who has cultivated carrots on a large scale and with
                    great success for several years, so accurate an account is presented of the
                    culture, application, and extraordinary value of this root, that carrots will
                    probably soon enter more largely into the rotation of crops on suitable soils.
                    We shall give the substance of this communication in his own words.</p>
                <p>“I usually sow seed of my own growth, from eight to ten pounds per acre: if
                    purchased, the price is in general from one shilling to one shilling and
                    sixpence per pound. By sowing seed of my own growing, I am enabled to speak both
                    to the nature of its stock, and likewise its quality in regard to newness. The
                    latter circumstance is of particular consequence in obtaining a full and healthy
                    plant, and not always to be guarded against if the seed is purchased of the
                    seedsman. Having weighed the quantity of seed to be sown, and collected sand or
                    fine mould in the proportion of about two bushels to an acre, I mix the seed
                    with the sand or mould, eight or ten pounds to every two bushels; and this is
                    done about a fortnight or three weeks before the time I intend sowing, taking
                    care to have the heaps turned over every day, sprinkling the outside of them
                    with water each time of turning over, that every part of die sand heaps may be
                    equally moist, and that vegetation may take place alike tliroughout. During this
                    time the land is preparing with a good dressing of manure, of about sixteen
                    cart-loads per acre of rotten farm-yard manure or cottagers’ ashes; the load
                    about as much as three able horses can draw, and, if bought, costs about four
                    shillings and sixpence per load, besides the carting on the land. I usually sow
                    my wheat stubbles after clover; plough the first time in autumn, and once more
                    in the early part of the month of February, if the weather permits; setting on
                    die manure at the time of sowing, which is about the last week in March, or
                    sometimes as late as the second week in April; but have generally found
                    early-sown crops the most productive. I have great advantage in preparing the
                    seed so long beforehand: it is by this means in a state of forward vegetation,
                    therefore lies but a short time in the ground, and, by quickly appearing above
                    ground, is more able to contend with those numerous tribes of weeds in the soil
                    whose seeds are of quicker vegetation.</p>
                <p>“Within about five or six weeks the carrots are ready to hoe; and, upon an
                    average of six years, on a light sandy loam, they have cost me L.l. 10s. 8d. per
                    acre hoeing; usually performed three, and sometimes four times, or until the
                    crop is perfectìy clean. The first hoeing is with hoes four inches long, and two
                    and a quarter inches wide; the second hoeing invariably takes place as soon as
                    the first is completed, and is performed with six-inch hoes, by two and a
                    quarter inches wide. By this time the plants are set; the first time of hoeing
                    nothing was cut but the weeds. I endeavour to leave the carrots nine inches
                    apart from each other; sometimes they will be a foot or even farther
                    asunder.</p>
                <p>“No other expense now attends the crop until the time of taking them up, which is
                    usually about the last week in October, as at that time I generally finish
                    soiling my horses with lucerne, and now solely depend upon my carrots, with a
                    proper allowance of hay, as winter food for my horses, until about the first
                    week of June following, when the lucerne is again ready for soiling. By reducing
                    this practice to a system, I have been enabled to feed ten cart-horses
                    throughout the winter months for these last six years, without giving them any
                    corn whatever, and have at the same time effected a considerable saving of hay
                    from what I found necessary to give to the same number of horses when, according
                    to the usual custom of the country, I fed my horses with corn and hay. I give
                    them to my cart-horses, in the proportion of 70 lb. weight of carrots a horse
                    per day upon an average, not allowing them quite so many in the very short days,
                    and something more than that quantity in the spring months, or to the amount of
                    what I withheld in the short winter days. The men who tend the horses slice some
                    of the carrots in the cut chaff or hay, and barn-door refuse; the rest of the
                    carrots they give whole to the horses at night, with a small quantity of hay in
                    their racks: and with this food my horses generally enjoy uninterrupted health.
                    I mention this, as I believe some persons think that carrots <hi rend="italic"
                    >only,</hi> given as food to horses, are injurious to their constitutions; but
                    most of the prejudices of mankind have no better foundation, and are taken up at
                    random, or inherited from their grandfathers.</p>
                <p>“So successful have I been with carrots as a winter food for horses, that with
                    the assistance of lucerne for soiling in summer, I have been enabled to prove,
                    by experiments conducted under my own personal inspection, that an able Norfolk
                    team-horse, fully worked two journeys a day, winter and summer, may be kept the
                    entire year round upon the produce of only one statute acre of land. I have
                    likewise applied carrots with great profit to the feeding of hogs in winter, and
                    by that means have made my straw into a most excellent manure, without the aid
                    of neat cattle: the hogs so fed are sold on Norwich hill to the London dealers
                    as porkers. The profit of carrots so applied I shall likewise show in my
                    subsequent statement; together with an experiment of feeding four Galloway
                    bullocks with carrots, against four others fed in the common way with turnips
                    and hay.</p>
                <p>“The taking up of the crop is put out to a man, who engages women and children to
                    assist him: the work is performed with three-pronged forks. The children cut off
                    the tops, laying them and the roots in separate heaps, ready for the teams to
                    take away. The expense altogether L.l. Is. per acre, of not less than seven or
                    eight hundred Winchester bushels. The carting away depends upon the distance of
                    the place where carried to: if not far, the expense will be lõs. to 18s. per
                    acre. The value of carrot tops given to bullocks and sheep in the first winter
                    quarter more than repays the two last-mentioned expenses. I take up in autumn a
                    sufficient quantity to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033579"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3579-0290"/>have a store to last me out any considerable frost
                    or snow that may happen in the winter months; the rest of the crop I leave in
                    the ground, preferring them fresh out of the earth for both horses and bullocks.
                    For the former, perhaps, it would be as well to wash the roots when they are
                    very wet and dirty, though I by no means think washing generally necessary. The
                    carrots keep best in the ground, nor can the severest frosts do them any
                    material injury. The first week in March it is necessary to have the remaining
                    part of the crop taken up, and the land cleared for barley. The carrots can
                    either be laid in a heap with a small quantity of straw covered over them, or
                    they may be laid into some empty cuthouse or barn in heaps of many hundred
                    bushels, provided they are put together dry. This latter circumstance it is
                    indispensably necessary to attend to; for, if laid together in large heaps when
                    wet, they will certainly sustain much injury. Such as I want to keep for the use
                    of my horses until the months of May and June, in drawing over the heaps (which
                    is necessary to be done the latter end of April, when the carrots begin to
                    sprout at the crown very fast) I throw aside the healthy and most perfect roots,
                    and have their crowns cut completely oft' and laid by themselves. By this means
                    carrots may be kept the month of June out in a high state of perfection.” <hi

                <p>Mr Burrows next proceeds to state the expense of his crops for four years
                    successively, in which he cultivated forty-nine acres in all; the average of the
                    first three years being L.10. 13s. 2½d. and the expense of the last year, when
                    he had twenty-five acres, L.8. 8s. 4d. per acre. In these sums, rent, interest
                    of capital, and all other charges are included. He then details at some length
                    the application of the crops, averaging upwards of 800 bushels per acre, to the
                    feeding of cart-horses, hogs, and cattle—both milch cows and fattening
                    bullocks,—from which there appears to result a clear profit on the first three
                    crops of no less than L.27. 18s. 3½d. per acre. The fourth crop of twenty-five
                    acres was sold to the tenant who succeeded him in his farm at twenty guineas per
                    acre, the price fixed by neutral men, leaving him a profit of L.12. Ils. 8d. per
                    acre. Mr Burrows was so well convinced of the great advantages of this
                    management, that he began with sixteen acres of carrots on his new farm; and we
                    are told, that the cultivation of this root is becoming more extensive, in
                    consequence of his successful practice.</p>
                <p>Carrots in many instances are sown by hand in rows, at narrow intervals for
                    hand-hoeing, the seeds not being easily deposited in a regular manner by the use
                    of the drill-machine. The hand-hoeing is certainly performed more correctly, and
                    with much less labour, when the plants are cultivated in rows.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Parsnip.</hi></p>
                <p>The parsnip has a root like the carrot; and the soil, preparation, and manure, as
                    well as the after-culture, are nearly the same for both. The quantity of seed
                    when sown in drills is from 4 to 5 lbs. per acre, but in broadcast 6 or 8 lbs.
                    About the middle of February is the usual sowing season, but sometimes
                    September; and the breadth of the drills when sown in this way is 15 or 18
                    inches. In the island of Jersey, where it is most extensively cultivated, beans
                    are commonly grown along with it, the beans being first dibbled in, and the
                    parsnip seed afterwards sown, broad-cast For fattening cattle it is considered
                    equal, if not superior to the carrot, and gives an exquisite flavour and a juicy
                    quality to the meat. About 30 lbs. of the root is the usual allowance to an ox
                    at each meal, with a little, hay between. When milch cows are fed with this root
                    and hay in winter, the colour and quality of the butter are said to be equal to
                    what is produced by the best pastures. Yet after all, both carrot and parsnip
                    require so much labour, and are such uncertain crops in most parts of Britain,
                    that they cannot be said to enter into the general rotation.</p>
                <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Pape.</hi></p>
                <p>Rape is now grown to a considerable extent in some I districts, not only for the
                    sake of the oil expressed from its seed, but also for feeding sheep on land not
                    well adapted to turnips. It is cultivated on a variety of soils, as a first crop
                    after paring and burning, and when old grass lands are brought into tillage; and
                    it often yields a very valuable crop. Upon lands kept under the plough it comes
                    into the rotation as a green crop; and the preparation and after-culture are the
                    same as for turnips; and it is sown much about the same time, or a little later,
                    but may also be transplanted from a seed-bed so late as September or October. A
                    variety of this plant is largely cultivated in Flanders, chiefly for the sake of
                    the oil obtained from its seed. The husks, in the form of cake or dust, after
                    the oil is expressed, are a well known manure, which we shall have occasion to
                    notice under the proper head. We shall give some remarks by the late Mr Culley
                    of Northumberland, founded on his own excellent practice, in which rape was
                    substituted for fallow on a poor clayey soil.</p>
                <p>“Rape may be sown from the 24th of May to the 8th of June, but comes to the
                    greatest growth if sown in May. If sown earlier it is apt to run to seed. From
                    two to three pounds of seed is required per acre, sown by a common turnip-seed
                    drill. But as rape-seed is so much larger than turnip-seed, the drill should be
                    wider. When hoed, the rape should be set out at the same distance as turnip
                    plants. The drills should be from 26 to 28 or 30 inches, according to the
                    quantity of dung given. As many ploughings, harrowings, and rollings, &amp;c.
                    should be given, as may be necessary to make that kind of poor soil as fine as
                    possible, and cleared of twitch, &amp;c.; the produce will be from twenty-five
                    to even fifty tons per acre, or upwards. But it is not so much the value of the
                    green crop (although the better the green crop, the better will the wheat be),
                    as the great certainty of a valuable crop of wheat, that merits attention. The
                    sheep are put on from the beginning to the middle of August: they must have the
                    rape consumed by the middle, or at latest by the end of September, so that the
                    wheat may be got sown on such poor damp soils, before the autumnal rains take
                    place. The number of sheep must depend upon the goodness or badness of the crop.
                    But as many sheep must be employed as to eat the rape by the middle of
                    September, or end of that month at the latest, for the reasons formerly given.
                    The Burwell red wheat (so called from a village in Cambridgeshire) is always
                    preferred. Poor clays will not allow deep ploughing; consequently that operation
                    must be governed by the depth of the soil. The land must be made as clean as any
                    naked fallow. There is scarcely an instance known of a crop of wheat, sown after
                    rape and eat off with sheep, being mildewed; and the grain is generally well
                    perfected. Mr Culley has known a crop of wheat after rape, upon a poor moorish
                    thin clay soil, worth much more than the fee simple of the land that produced
                    it. He has frequently known land, both after rape and after naked fallow, in the
                    same field; and invariably the rape wheat was better in every respect than that
                    after naked fallow.” <hi rend="italic">(Husbandry of Scotland,</hi> vol. ii.

                <p>The culture of cabbage in the fields is not carried on <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193033592" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3592-0291"/>upon a great scale, though
                    very profitable crops have been raised in particular situations. The variety
                    cultivated for cattle is the large field cabbage, known by several names. It
                    prefers a strong loam, which is to be prepared in much the same manner as for
                    potatoes or turnips, the plants being dibbled along the top of each ridgelet any
                    time from March to June, though the earliest crops are usually the best. Plants
                    to be used in March must be got from seed sown in the month of August preceding;
                    but those planted out in May or June may be raised from a sowing in February or
                    March. The after-culture consists in horse and hand hoeing and weeding, the
                    produce being from 35 to 40 tons the acre, which is commonly used in the feeding
                    of milch cows, but sometimes also in fattening sheep and oxen. They are
                    excellent food for ewes that have newly dropt their lambs, as they produce
                    abundance of milk.</p>
                <p>14. <hi rend="italic">Clovers.</hi></p>
                <p>Clovers enter largely into the succession of crops on all soils, and in every
                    productive course of management. Before they were introduced into cultivation,
                    when land was exhausted by grain crops, it was necessary to leave it in a state
                    of comparative sterility for several years before it was either valuable as
                    pasture, or again fit for carrying corn. But at present clovers are not only
                    indispensable in the cultivation of white and green crops <hi rend="italic"
                    >alternately</hi> upon very rich soils, but are the foundation of <hi
                    rend="italic">convertible</hi> husbandry on land that is not so rich as to
                    permit of constant aration, and which therefore requires two or more years’
                    pasturage at certain intervals. As the succession of crops forms the subject of
                    the following section, in which we shall have occasion to notice the great value
                    of clover as a crop in the alternate and convertible systems of husbandry, we
                    shall here consider it without any particular reference to its general utility
                    in that view.</p>
                <p>Red clover, or, as it is sometimes called, broad clover, is the kind most
                    generally cultivated on land that carries white and green crops alternately, as
                    it yields a larger produce for one crop than any of the other sorts. White and
                    yellow clover are seldom sown with it, unless when several years’ pasturage is
                    intended. As ryegrass is almost invariably sown with clover, it will be
                    necessary to notice it also in this place.</p>
                <p>Clover and ryegrass are sown <hi rend="italic">broad-cast</hi> along with or upon
                    growing culmiferous corn crops of every kind, and are found to prosper almost
                    equally well with spring-sown wheat, barley, and the early varieties of oats.
                    Being most generally sown in spring, they are usually put in immediately after
                    the soil has been pulverized by harrowing in the corn seed, and are themselves
                    covered by one course more of the harrows; or if the corn is drilled, they are
                    sown immediately before or after hand-hoeing, and the land is then finished by a
                    course of the harrows. A lighter harrow is generally employed in covering
                    grassseeds than that used for corn. When the land is under an autumn-sown crop
                    of wheat or other grain, though the clovers and ryegrass arc still sown in
                    spring, the proper period must depend both upon its condition and the progress
                    of the crop; and it may be often advisable to break the crust formed on the
                    surface of tenacious soils, by using the harrow before the clovers are sown, as
                    well as afterwards to cover them. Sometimes the roller only is employed at this
                    time; and there are instances of clover and ryegrass succeeding when sown
                    without either harrowing or rolling. But it is commonly of advantage to the
                    wheat crop itself to use the harrows in spring; and the roller alone cannot be
                    depended on, unless the season be very favourable. In some cases grass-seeds are
                    sown by themselves, either in autumn or spring, but rarely on tillage land, the
                    subject of the present chapter.</p>
                <p>The quantity of red clover and ryegrass sown on an acre is exceedingly various,
                    not only according as more or less white or yellow clover is sown along with
                    them, as when pasturage is intended; but even when they are the only kinds sown,
                    the quantity is varied by the quality of the soil, and the different purposes of
                    hay, soiling, or one year’s pasture, to which the crop is to be applied. When
                    pasture is the object, more seed ought to be allowed than is necessary when the
                    crop is to be cut green for soiling; and for hay, less may suffice than for
                    either of the former. Finely pulverized soils do not require so much seed as
                    clays on which clover and ryegrass are very frequently sown among autumn or
                    winter-sown wheat, when there is more danger of a part of it perishing from
                    being imperfectly covered. In general, eight or ten pounds may be taken as the
                    <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> quantity, though there have been instances of
                    good crops from less; and from that to 14 lbs. or more per English statute acre.
                    Ryegrass, commonly at the rate of a bushel per acre, but in many cases only half
                    or two-thirds of a bushel, is mixed with this weight of clover, and both are
                    sown at the same time. The ryegrass may be either of the perennial or annual
                    variety, as it is understood that the herbage is to be continued for only one
                    year; and the annual Γs sometimes sown in preference, as producing a bulkier
                    crop than the. perennial.</p>
                <p>In the selection of clover and ryegrass seeds, particular attention should be
                    paid to their quality and cleanness. The purple colour of the clover seed
                    denotes that it has been ripe and well saved, and the seeds of weeds may be
                    detected in it by narrow inspection if there be any; but various noxious weeds
                    are frequently mixed up with the seeds of the ryegrass, which it is difficult
                    either to discover or to separate from them. Between the seeds of the annual and
                    perennial ryegrass the difference is hardly discernible; and therefore, unless
                    it is of his own growth, the cultivator must depend in a great measure on the
                    character of the person from whom he purchases it. Red clover from Holland or
                    France has been found to die out in the season immediately after it has been cut
                    or pastured; while the English seed produces plants which stand over the second,
                    many of them the third year (<hi rend="italic">General Report of Scotland,</hi>
                    vol. i. p. 537), thus remaining in the latter case four summers in the ground
                    from the time of sowing.</p>
                <p>Clover and ryegrass, as has been already hinted, are made into hay, cut green for
                    being used in soiling, or depastured. As we shall have occasion to speak again
                    of hay-making, we shall here only notice the principal operations.</p>
                <p>This sort of herbage ought always to be cut as close to the ground as possible;
                    and the soil, having been previously cleared of any stones that might impede the
                    scythe, and also levelled with a heavy roller, admits of mowing being performed
                    in a very uniform and perfect manner, unless the crop be lodged or broken down
                    by wind. Whatever part of the stems is left by the scythe is not only lost, but
                    the after-growth is neither so vigorous nor so weighty as when the first cutting
                    is taken as low as possible.</p>
                <p>Clover and ryegrass are commonly all mown in June, though in the north sometimes
                    not till near the end of July. The time of mowing must, indeed, be determined by
                    the growth of the plants; but it is a common error to allow them to stand too
                    long. They should in every case be cut down before the seeds are formed, that
                    their juices may be as much as possible retained in the hay. When <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193033605" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3605-0292"/>the stems become hard and
                    sapless, by being allowed to bring their seeds towards maturity, they are of
                    little more value as provender than an equal quantity of the finer-sort of straw
                    of corn.</p>
                <p>One of the best among the various modes of hay-making, at least for clover and
                    ryegrass, may be described in a few words. As soon as the swath is thoroughly
                    dry above, it is gently turned over (not <hi rend="italic">tedded</hi> or
                    scattered), ’ without breaking it. Sometimes this is done by the hand, or by a
                    small fork; and some farmers are so anxious to prevent the swath from being
                    broken, that they will not permit the use of the rake-shaft. The grass, when
                    turned over in the morning of a dry day, is put into cocks in the afternoon. The
                    mode of performing this is very simple and expeditious; and none but women,
                    boys, and girls, under the eye of a confidential servant, are usually employed.
                    If the crop is heavy, a row of cocks is placed in the middle ridge of three, and
                    if light, of five ridges. A distinct company of <hi rend="italic">carriers</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">rakers</hi> is allotted to every such number of ridges;
                    and the separate companies proceed each on its own ground, in the same manner as
                    in reaping grain, which occasions a degree of competition among them for
                    dispatch, clean raking, and neat well-built cocks. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >carriers</hi> gather the hay, and carry it to the ridge where the cock is to be
                    built, by one of the most experienced hands. A <hi rend="italic">raker</hi>
                    follows the <hi rend="italic">carrier,</hi> taking up .and bringing to the cocks
                    the remains of the swath. There may be in general about five people employed
                    about each row of cocks; a carrier and raker on each side of the ridge on which
                    the cocks are placed, and a person on the ridge, who builds them. But when the
                    crop is not weighty, more rakers are required, as a greater space must be gone
                    over.</p>
                <p>As the cocks are thus placed in a line, it is easy to put two or more into one
                    afterwards; and the larger cocks may be speedily drawn together, to be put into
                    trampricks, by means of ropes thrown round their bottoms, and dragged along by a
                    horse. It is impossible to lay down any rules for the management of hay after it
                    is put into cocks; one thing is, however, always attended to, not to shake out,
                    scatter, or expose the hay oftener than is really necessary for its
                    preservation. Sometimes the cocks have been put up so large, that they never
                    required to go to a tramp-rick, but were carted to the stack-yard, without ever
                    being broken, and put up in alternate layers with old hay. But where this is
                    attempted, there must not be much clover. The practice of mixing the new with
                    the old hay is, however, a good one, and saves a great deal of time and labour,
                    at the same time that the old hay is much improved by the mixture.</p>
                <p>The best managers disapprove of spreading out the swaths of clover and ryegrass,
                    though this is often necessary with natural grasses, which are cut and harvested
                    later in the season. The more the swath is kept unbroken, the hay is the greener
                    and the more fragrant.</p>
                <p>Another mode of hay-making, said to have been originally practised in Lancashire,
                    has been found to answer well in the moist atmosphere of the west of Scotland.
                    This is called <hi rend="italic">tippling</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >rippling</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, if the grass be dry, the operation
                    begins as soon as it is mown. “In making a tipple, a person, with his right
                    hand, rolls the swath inwards, until he has a little bundle; then the same is
                    done by the left, until both meet, and form 8 to 12 pounds, or nearly so. This
                    bundle is then set up against the legs, or between the feet; a rope is twisted
                    off the grass, while the bundle is supported in this manner, and tied round it,
                    near its top; and from the top are drawn up a few straggling stems, which are
                    twisted, to make the tipple taper to a point, and give it as much a conical
                    shape as possible. If the crop is strong, there is a row of tipples placed on
                    each swath; if light, two of these are put into one row. After standing a few
                    hours, they become so smooth on the outside, that the heaviest rains seldom wet
                    them through; and when wet, they are soon dried again in good weather. As soon
                    as ready, they are put into the summer-rick, or, if very dry, even into the
                    winter-stack, but are never opened out or <hi rend="italic">tedded</hi> to make
                    them dry, as they never require it By this method not a blade is lost, and the
                    hay is nearly as green as a leaf dried in a book. In a moderate crop, one woman
                    will tipple to one mower, and a woman will rake to two tipplers or two swathers.
                    But where the crop is strong, it may require three women to keep pace with two
                    mowers. After the hay is put up in this manner, the crop may be considered as
                    secure, though it may continue wet weather for a considerable length of time.”
                    <hi rend="italic">(General Report of Scotland,</hi> vol. ii. p. 11.)</p>
                <p>Hay is commonly carried to the stack-yard, and built either in circular or oblong
                    stacks (the latter form being most generally approved of), and carefully
                    thatched, as has been already observed in regard to corn. It is never advisable
                    to allow this kind of hay to become heated in any considerable degree in the
                    stack, though a slight exudation, with a very gentle warmth, is usually
                    perceptible, both in the field ricks and in the stacks, for a few days after
                    they are built; but this is quite a different thing from that intentional
                    heating, carried so far, in many instances, as to terminate in
                    conflagration.</p>
                <p>The weight of hay from clover and ryegrass varies, according to the soil and the
                    season, from one to three tons per English acre, as it is taken from the
                    tramp-ricks; but after being stacked and kept till spring, the weight is found
                    to be diminished 25 or 30 per cent. Its price per ton depends entirely on
                    situation: at a distance from towns or large villages, in ordinary seasons, the
                    price is usually very low, and the whole of it is generally consumed on the farm
                    that produced it. Its intrinsic value as fodder, in comparison with the straw of
                    beans or peas, may be in the proportion of three to two; and with the finest
                    straw of corn crops, in the proportion of two to one.</p>
                <p>Many intelligent cultivators consider ryegrass as a very severe crop for the
                    soil; and it is alleged that wheat does not succeed well after the herbage with
                    which it is intermixed in any considerable quantity. Other plants have
                    accordingly been recommended as a substitute for ryegrass, and cocksfoot <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dactylis glomerata)</hi> has been tried, apparently with great
                    success, by Mr Coke of Holkham, in Norfolk, and others. But this is a very
                    coarse grass when allowed to rise to any height, and the use of it for hay has
                    not yet been fully ascertained.</p>
                <p>When the hay crop is cut and removed, there is commonly a vigorous after-growth,
                    which may be either cut or pastured. As this consists almost exclusively of red
                    clover, and is extremely succulent, it is seldom made into hay, owing to the
                    difficulty of getting it thoroughly dried at a late period of summer, when other
                    more urgent operations usually employ all the labourers of a farm. If it be cut
                    for this purpose, the best method of saving it is, to mix it up with straw,
                    which will absorb a part of its juices. It is often cut green, as a part of the
                    soiling system; or, where a sheep stock is kept, pastured by the old ewes, or
                    other sorts, that are to be fattened the ensuing winter on turnips.</p>
                <p>On all farms under correct management, a part of this! crop is cut green for the
                    working horses, often for milch cows, and in some instances both for growing and
                    fattening cattle. This mode of consuming it is known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">soiling.</hi> There can be no doubt of the advantages of this
                    practice in regard to horses and cows; but for young and for fattening beasts, a

                    with any great degree of accuracy. Young animals require exercise in the open
                    air, and probably will not be found to thrive so well in houses or fold-yards,
                    during summer, as on pastures; and though in every case there is a great saving
                    of food, the long, woody, and comparatively naked stems of the plants, with
                    leaves always more or less withered, are perhaps not so valuable in the
                    production of beef on fattening stock, as a much smaller weight of herbage taken
                    in by pasturing. Milch cows, however, are so impatient of heat and insects, that
                    this way of feeding them, at least for a part of the day, in warm weather, ought
                    to be more generally adopted; and the convenience of having working horses
                    always at hand, besides that they fill their stomachs speedily, is of no less
                    importance than economy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In feeding cattle with green clover, attention must be paid to prevent swelling
                    or <hi rend="italic">hoving,</hi> which is very apt to take place when they are
                    first put on this food, especially if it be wet with rain or dew; and cattle are
                    exposed to this danger, whether they are sent to depasture the clover, or have
                    it cut and brought home to them; though, if the plants be somewhat luxuriant,
                    the danger is greater in the former case. After being accustomed to this rich
                    food for a few days, during which it should be given rather sparingly, the
                    danger is much diminished; but it is never safe to allow milch cows, in
                    particular, to eat large quantities of wet clover.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto spoken of red clover and ryegrass, as cultivated for the sake of
                    the stems and leaves, and shall now add a few words about the management
                    required when the object is to save their seeds. Ryegrass seed is gathered in
                    almost every part of Britain, but clover seed can seldom be saved in any
                    profitable quantity in the northern parts. In Scotland, red clover is never
                    cultivated for seed.</p>
                <p>The common practice in regard to ryegrass is, to let the mixed crop of that and
                    clover stand till the seeds of the former have attained a considerable degree of
                    ripeness, when it is cut down and made into hay in the usual manner; and the
                    seeds of the ryegrass are separated by the use of the flail, commonly before the
                    hay is put into the field-ricks. Sometimes, when but a small quantity is wanted,
                    the hay is merely shaken well upon a cloth, when it is building in the
                    stack-yard; or afterwards, in the stableloft, before it is put into the horses’
                    racks. But in all of these methods, in order to obtain good seed, the clover
                    must remain uncut beyond the proper season; and it is thus materially injured in
                    quality, while the value of the ryegrass seed, in such a crop, is merely a
                    secondary consideration.</p>
                <p>When seed is the principal object of the culture of ryegrass, it ought not to be
                    mixed with clover at all, though it maybe sown along with any of the kinds of
                    corn already mentioned; and it is treated the year after in every respect as a
                    crop of corn; bound up in sheaves, built in stacks, threshed with the flail, and
                    dressed by the winnowing-machine, in the same manner.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of distinguishing between the annual and perennial varieties of
                    ryegrass has led to the practice, in some places, of cutting or pasturing the
                    first year’s crop, and taking a crop for seed in the second year. If the growth
                    of the ryegrass plants be close and vigorous the second year, there is reason to
                    be satisfied that the seed is of the perennial variety; and though red clover
                    has been sown with the ryegrass, a great part of it disappears by that time, and
                    forms but a‘small portion of the second year’s cutting.</p>
                <p>The seed of red clover is saved with more labour and difficulty. As the plant
                    does not perfect its seed early in summer, it is necessary to take off the first
                    growth, either by feeding or cutting. In the first case, it is eaten till about
                    the end of May, frequently by ewes and lambs; and this is understood to be an
                    advantageous practice, because the land is less exhausted, and the green food is
                    of great value for stock in the spring months. It is not uncommon, however, to
                    cut the first growth for a hay crop; and this should be done earlier than
                    usual.</p>
                <p>The growth thus reserved for seed must be suffered to remain till the husks
                    become perfectly brown, when it is cut and harvested in the usual manner,
                    leaving it on the field till it is very dry and crisp, that the seeds may become
                    more fully hardened: it may then be laid up dry, to be threshed out at the
                    farmer’s convenience.</p>
                <p>Much labour and expense are necessary in separating the seed from the capsule or
                    seed-coat, especially when it is effected by threshing, which seldom costs less
                    than from five to six or seven shillings per bushel. By the use of mills the
                    work may be done much cheaper.</p>
                <p>The produce in seed may generally be from three to four or five bushels per acre
                    when perfectly clean, weighing from two to three hundredweights. But there is
                    great uncertainty in the produce of clover seed, from the lateness of the season
                    at which it becomes ripe; and the fertility of the soil is considerably impaired
                    by such a crop. Yet the high value of the seed is a great inducement to the
                    saving of it, in favourable situations. (Dickson’s <hi rend="italic">Practical
                    Agricultures</hi> vol. ii. p. 863.)</p>
                <p>When it is intended to retain the land in pasture for several years, the quantity
                    of red clover is diminished, and several kinds of more permanent herbage are
                    added, the most common of which are, white and yellow clover, and ribwort. No
                    general rule can be laid down as to the proper quantity of each of these kinds;
                    in some cases red and white clover are sown in equal proportions, and in others
                    the latter is made greatly to predominate. The yellow clover and ribwort are not
                    often sown at the rate of more than two or three pounds per acre. It is scarcely
                    necessary to add, that in this case the ryegrass should always be of the
                    perennial sort.</p>
                <p>When permanent pasture is the object, a still greater variety of seeds has been
                    recommended. But as cultivators are by no means agreed on this point, and as the
                    different kinds and proportions which are thought best adapted to different
                    soils have none of them the sanction of extensive experience, we shall refer the
                    reader to the third volume of <hi rend="italic">Communications to the Board of
                    Agricultures</hi> which is wholly occupied with essays on the best means of
                    breaking up old grass-lands, and restoring them after a few years to permanent
                    pasture.</p>
                <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Lucerne.</hi></p>
                <p>This is a deep-rooting perennial plant, that sends up numerous tall clover-like
                    shoots, which bear blue or violet-coloured flowers. It is much cultivated in the
                    south of Europe, and has also been found to answer in some parts of England,
                    though the principal seat of its culture is Kent. The Roman writers <hi
                    rend="italic">Be lie</hi><hi rend="italic">Rustica</hi> extol this plant beyond
                    all reasonable bounds, and are very minute in their directions about its
                    cultivation. Lucerne requires a very deep, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033631"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3631-0294"/>friable soil, inclining to sand, with a subsoil of
                    a similar character. It is sown, either in drills or broad-cast, in March or
                    early in April, and sometimes along with barley; the quantity of seed being from
                    15 to 20 pounds if sown in the latter way, and from 8 to 12 if in the former. It
                    must always be kept free from weeds, and should be top-dressed with dung or
                    other manure at least every five or six years. Some prefer giving it a slight
                    dressing every spring. It is consumed in much the same way .as clover, either in
                    a green state, or after being made into hay. In some very favourable situations
                    it admits of being cut five times in the course of the summer. It is an
                    excellent food in its green state, both for horses and milch cows; and if it be
                    equal in the quantity of its produce to a full crop of red clover, and continue
                    in a productive state for nine or ten years with only the expense of occasional
                    top-dressings, it would appear to be entitled to a preference on all suitable
                    soils and situations. The failure of clover on lands where it has been long or
                    too frequently grown, a fact which seems to be generally admitted, may induce
                    our farmers to make trials of lucerne in places where it is yet very little
                    known; and it may possibly in time become so inured to our climate as to answer
                    in parts of the island where it is now thought unlikely to succeed. Though it
                    can never come into our rotations like red clover, on lands kept under an
                    alternate course of corn and green crops, not attaining its most productive
                    state in a single year, yet it may be introduced upon those soils which require
                    to be kept from the plough, and in pasture for several years, before they are
                    restored to tillage.</p>
                <p>16. <hi rend="italic">Saintfoin.</hi></p>
                <p>This is also a deep-rooting perennial plant, suited to dry, warm, chalky soils.
                    It is sown in February or March, at the rate of about four bushels to the acre,
                    sometimes along with barley or other kinds of grain; is ready for being mown the
                    second year, and may last from seven to ten years, though in its greatest
                    perfection in about three years. The produce in hay is from 1½ ton to 2 tons per
                    acre. It is mown for soiling or hay, or pastured in the same way as clover. If
                    the crop is chiefly taken off by mowing, it must be occasionally top-dressed
                    with manure or peat ashes.</p>
                <p>17. <hi rend="italic">Flax and Hemp.</hi></p>
                <p>The soil most proper for flax is one that is deep, friable, and rather moist. It
                    often succeeds well in lands taken up from grass, or after only one crop of
                    corn. In Ireland it is usually sown by the small farmers after potatoes. The
                    land must be well pulverized before the seed is sown, cleared of stones or
                    roots, and rolled after the seed is put in. The usual time of sowing is from the
                    middle of March to the end of April. Dutch seed is in the highest estimation,
                    affording a greater produce than the American seed, and a finer quality than the
                    Riga. The after-culture consists in taking up the weeds as they rise,—a very
                    tedious process if the land be at all foul, as it can only be done by the
                    hand,—and in some cases in the further use of the roller. The crop is raised by
                    pulling up the plants by the root: immediately after, they are put into a pool
                    to be steeped or watered; and, when taken out of the pool, spread out upon
                    grass-land to dry and bleach. The time allowed for steeping and bleaching varies
                    with the condition of the plant and the state of the weather, but need seldom
                    exceed 10 or 12 days for each. But both these processes may be dispensed with by
                    the use of Hill and Bundy’s patent machines, by which the entire preparation may
                    be completed in six days. The produce in seed, when that is the object, is from
                    6 to 8, and sometimes as high as 10 or 12 bushels per acre. The best of it is
                    kept for sowing again, the next quality is crushed for oil, and the inferior is
                    boiled or steamed for cattle. The cake itself, or the residuum after the oil has
                    been expressed from the seed, is alone a valuable article in the fattening of
                    live stock and in the rearing of calves. The produce of flax in fibre may vary
                    from 3 cwts. to half a ton the acre.</p>
                <p>Hemp requires a deep, black, vegetable soil, somewhat inclined to moisture; and
                    the preparation and season for sowing, and the after-culture and management, are
                    all nearly the same as for flax. But the male plants are usually taken up four
                    or five weeks before the female, so as to give the latter time to ripen their
                    seeds.</p>
                <p>Flax and hemp, when allowed to ripen their seeds, are considered exhausting
                    crops, even more so than corn; and, in most parts of Britain, are so uncertain
                    in their produce, that their cultivation has hitherto been very limited. But a
                    great deal of flax is raised in Ireland.</p>
                <p>18. <hi rend="italic">Hops.</hi></p>
                <p>The hop has been long cultivated extensively in several parts of England, and
                    would probably answer in the south of Ireland; but it is not adapted to the
                    climate of Scotland. In the most favourable situations it is a most precarious
                    crop, sometimes yielding large profits, and at others scarcely defraying the
                    expenses of management. The soils most favourable to the growth of hops are
                    clays and strong deep loams, with a dry, friable subsoil.</p>
                <p>“When it is intended to make a new plantation, the best method is to have
                    cuttings from approved stock planted out the year before they are wanted in the
                    hopground, as the use of plants instead of cuttings not only gains a year, but
                    they are more certain to flourish, as many of the cuttings will not take root in
                    a dry season, unless they are watered, which is seldom resorted to. A small
                    piece of moist land is sufficient to raise plants for many acres, and at little
                    expense. If the ground be in grass, some would pare and burn the surface, and
                    take a crop of grain, which is not so advisable as paring and digging in the
                    sods. The land is worked with a spade, and set out into ridges of 3½ yards wide,
                    and two yards between each, having a strip of grass (called a pillar) next every
                    ridge, and an open drain between every two pillars, the depth of which must vary
                    according to the soil, some being less than one foot, and others nearly four
                    feet in depth. Three rows of plants, or, as they are termed, hills, are made
                    upon each ridge, which should intersect each other. They are generally nearly
                    two yards distant in the rows, so that about 1300 are the usual number of hills
                    in a statute acre; but as some grounds, where only two poles are set at each
                    hill, are in narrower ridges, the number of hills is consequently greater.'
                    Small sticks are proper to tie the bines up to the first year, then small poles
                    for a year or two, the size of which should be gradually increased. Some set two
                    poles to every hill, which is proper for ground producing luxuriant bines; but
                    on clay land, three poles are set in a triangular form to the hills on the two
                    outside rows of each ridge, and only two in the middle row. Many additional
                    poles, longer than the rest, called catch-poles, are also set to take the bines
                    as they run beyond the lesser poles. Where the bine is weak, three heads are
                    commonly trained up each pole; though two are better, if strong. Their course
                    round the pole is the contrary to that of the kidney-bean. If the ground
                    intended for a new plantation is not clean from couchgrass, a complete fallow is
                    essential, whether it is grass or stubble; and a crop of turnips may be taken to
                    advantage if the land is proper for their growth, and can be made clean, as hops
                    are planted in March.</p>

                    price of planting varies with the mode pursued; and if the drains are required
                    to be deep, or the soil is particularly strong, a still greater sum will be
                    expended; to which may be added L.25 per acre for poles, before the ground has
                    its full quantity; and also the rent, taxes, &amp;c. and the working for three
                    years, before many hops can be expected. A substantial building for an oast or
                    kiln cannot be erected for L.100, if it has store-rooms necessary for only five
                    acres. The following are termed the annual orders :—Digging the ground
                    completely over, hoeing the earth from the hills, and cutting off the stock a
                    little above the root, which are called pickling and cutting; poling, which is
                    carrying the poles from the stacks, and setting them down to the hills with a
                    round implement shod with iron, and called a poy, having a crutch at the top,
                    and a peg through the middle to tread upon; tying the bines round the poles with
                    rushes, and pulling up the superfluous bines; hoeing the ground all over with a
                    hoe of large dimensions; wheeling and laying manure upon every hill; covering
                    the manure with the soil, which is done by scraping the ground over with a hoe,
                    and is called hilling; and stacking, which is carrying and setting up the poles
                    into heaps or stacks, after the crop has been taken. The annual expense of these
                    orders varies from L.2. 15s. to L.3, 5s. per acre.</p>
                <p>“As to the manure most proper for the hop-culture, good stable dung is much used,
                    and is preferred to the manure made by cattle, as the latter encourages ants on
                    strong ground. Woollen rags are the best for forcing a luxuriant bine, and, if
                    used with judgment, are excellent for clay ground; but they are apt to make the
                    hops small, if too many are used. Malt culm and dove manure are excellent; and
                    one complete dressing with lime is very serviceable for strong ground.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> When the crop is ripe, a proper number of pickers
                    are procured, for whom are provided light wooden frames, called binges: they are
                    clothed with hop-bagging, into which the hops are picked off the poles by women
                    and children, having them brought by men, who take them up by cutting the bines
                    about a foot above the ground, and drawing up the poles by an instrument called
                    a dragon. Each binge has from four to six pickers, and a man attends to one or
                    two binges, according to the crop; he strips the bines from the poles as they
                    are picked, and lays them in heaps ready for stacking; he also carries the hops
                    to the kilns, if near, or to a cart as they are measured from the binge. It is
                    necessary to have a supply of cokes in the kilns to dry the hops, which are
                    spread on a hair-cloth which is upon an upper open floor of wood, above the fire
                    or fires, every noon and midnight, whilst the picking continues. They are
                    stirred repeatedly, and, when cured, are turned oft’ into the store-room, to be
                    put into bags and pockets (after they have been there about a week), which is
                    done by fixing each bag ("being first legally marked with the grower’s name,
                    &amp;c.) in a frame, and treading the hops in. The excise-officer, who attends
                    during the season, then weighs them, and charges 2d. per pound for the duty,
                    when they become marketable.</p>
                <p>“From the foregoing particulars, it will appear that there is scarcely any hop
                    ground but costs yearly upwards of L12 per acre (exclusive of the picking and
                    duty, which may exceed L.20 per acre, or be very little); and there are other
                    grounds in which upwards of L.20 per acre are annually expended; so the average
                    may be said to be about L.15 per acre, without the picking, drying, and
                    duty.</p>
                <p>“If a good plantation produces 10 cwt. per acre in a crop year, which are sold at
                    L.5 per cwt., the annual expenses being L.20, and the picking, &amp;c. and duty
                    L.20&gt; the profit will be L.10; and admitting that the same ground pays all
                    expenses in a blight year, and supposing that to be every third year, the
                    profits would be nearly L.7 per acre annually; but, as the foregoing crop cannot
                    be expected on any ground every other year, the produce of the third year may be
                    stated at 5 cwt. per acre, at 8 guineas per cwt., deducting the annual expenses,
                    L.20, and the picking and duty, L.12.</p>
                <p>“This plant is extremely liable to disasters, from its first putting up in the
                    spring, until the time of picking the crop, which is in September. Snails or
                    slugs, ants and fleas, are formidable enemies in the first instance. Frosts are
                    inimical to its growth; and the bines are frequently blighted, even after they
                    have readied the top of the poles. Small green flies, and other insects, which
                    make their appearance in the months of May and June, when the wind is about
                    north-east, often greatly injure them; and they are subject to take damage by
                    high winds from the south-west. The best situation for a plantation, therefore,
                    is a southern aspect, well shaded on three sides, either by hills or planting,
                    which is supposed to be the chief protection that can be given them.” We have
                    taken these observations on hops from an able communication by Mr Parkinson,
                    himself a hop-grower, given in the <hi rend="italic">Farmer’s Magazine,</hi>
                    vol. xvi.</p>
                <p>On a suitable soil, a hop plantation may continue for fifteen years or more, but
                    commonly begins to fall off about the tenth year. The expense of forming one has
                    been estimated in all at from L.70 to L.100 per acre. One objection to the
                    cultivation of hops is, that they require a great deal of dung, which in most
                    cases can only be procured by abstracting it from the tillage-lands. On the
                    other hand, it is admitted, that upon suitable soils, and under good management,
                    they make a very profitable return.</p>
                <p>19. <hi rend="italic">Crops occasionally cultivated.</hi></p>
                <p>Under this head we may notice a few plants, which, though of some local
                    importance, cannot be considered as forming an object to agriculturists
                    generally.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Fullers Thistle</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Teazle,</hi>
                    the heads of which are used for raising the nap on woollen cloths. It is grown
                    in Essex and the west of England.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Wood.</hi> This is now chiefly cultivated in Lincolnshire.
                    It is used in dyeing, as a basis for black and other colours.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Weld</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Dyer’s Weed</hi> is
                    cultivated in some parts of England, chiefly in Essex, and used for giving a
                    yellow colour to cotton, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Spurry {spergula arvensis),</hi> which is a diminutive
                    annual weed, that grows on dry, sandy corn lands in most parts of Europe. In
                    Germany and the Netherlands it is sown on corn stubbles, and fed off with sheep;
                    and is said to enrich the milk of cows, and improve the quality of mutton. Some
                    writers have recommended its cultivation in England, where it probably would not
                    pay the expense of seed and labour.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Fiorin.</hi> This plant has been strongly recommended,
                    within these few years, by the late Dr Richardson of Ireland, as suitable, not
                    for meadows or hay ground only, but also for arable land; and for this reason it
                    is noticed here. In consequence of that gentleman’s writings, trials were made
                    of it upon a variety of soils in different parts of Scotland, particularly and
                    upon a large scale at Dalswinton in Dumfries-shire; and the result seems to be,
                    that though a heavy crop of it may certainly be procured on mossy or peaty
                    soils, yet that upon all other descriptions of land it is not by any means so
                    valuable as the crops already in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033657"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3657-0296"/>use. It does not admit of being pastured, affords
                    only one cutting in the year, requires to be top-dressed with ashes or other
                    manure; and after all, upon moderately dry soils, the produce is of very little
                    value. We have seen a crop of it upon rather dry land, under the management
                    prescribed by the doctor himself, which would scarcely pay the expense of
                    cutting and carrying to the farm-yard. Still we think it deserves the notice of
                    those who possess moss lands, as there can be no doubt of its having yielded a
                    large produce under the doctor’s own management, and we believe also on a
                    similar soil at Dalswinton. It is certainly relished by horses and other live
                    stock.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Buck Wheat.</hi> In this country buck wheat is chiefly
                    cultivated for feeding poultry, pigeons, and hogs; though it is also used in the
                    distilleries, and occasionally the meal is made into thin cakes for bread. It
                    will grow on almost any soil, and may produce on an average from 3 to 4 quarters
                    the acre. The season of sowing is the last week of April, or first week of May.
                    When allowed to stand for a crop, there is nothing worthy of particular notice
                    in its after-culture or management; but some think it of most value when
                    ploughed down green, as a preparation for other crops.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Maize</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Indian Corn</hi> is now
                    under trial in this country by Mr William Cobbett, who is very sanguine of
                    success. It has been hitherto considered as a crop quite unsuited to the climate
                    of Britain.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Kelp.</hi> The plants from which this substance is made can
                    hardly be said to belong to agriculture, yet it is nevertheless of too much
                    importance in many parts of Scotland and Ireland to be passed over without
                    notice. It is made from different varieties of the <hi rend="italic">fuci,</hi>
                    among which the <hi rend="italic">fucus vesiculosus</hi> is considered the most
                    productive. The plants which grow on the sea-coast are cut in the summer months,
                    and dried and burned in a rude sort of kiln on the spot. It is of great
                    importance to preserve them from the rain when they have been laid out to dry.
                    The plants may be cut when two or three years old. There are immense tracts on
                    the coast of the mainland and islands of Scotland, where it is thought kelp
                    might be produced merely by putting down stones upon the vacant spaces. During
                    the late war, the best sorts of kelp sometimes sold for L.20 per ton, and the
                    land-owners derived a very considerable profit from its manufacture; but since
                    the peace, barilla having come again into our market at a reduced price, that of
                    kelp has fallen so low as to yield little or no profit, after defraying the
                    necessary expenses. The principal consumption of kelp is in the manufacture of
                    glass and soap. The barilla plant itself, it is believed, might be tried in this
                    country, with a reasonable prospect of success. It has been introduced into
                    France, where the produce was found to be as good in quality as that procured
                    from Alicant. But the most important step, perhaps, would be to improve the
                    manufacture of our own kelp; a point to which the Highland Society of Scotland
                    has very properly given much of its attention of late, and in whose publications
                    a great deal of useful information will be found upon the subject.</p>
                <p>The following account of the manufacture in the island of Harris, one of the
                    western isles of Scotland, is from the 6th volume of the <hi rend="italic">Prize
                    Essays and Transactions</hi> of that Society, published in 1824.</p>
                <p>“1. The quantity of kelp manufactured on the farm of Strond this season was 115
                    tons.</p>
                <p>“2. All the kelp was made from cut-ware of two years’ growth.</p>
                <p>« 3. The plants used were, <hi rend="italic">fucus nodosus,</hi> or lady-ware;
                    <hi rend="italic">fucus vesiculosus,</hi> or bell-ware; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >fucus serratus,</hi> or black-ware.</p>
                <p>“It may not be superfluous to remark, that all the kelp made of cut-ware is from
                    these different plants, and that they are always mixed together, as the
                    different varieties' grow on kelp-shores generally, and in the following order
                    :—The <hi rend="italic">fucus nodosus</hi> grows on that part of the shore
                    between high-water spring-tides and high-water neap-tides; and mucous bell-ware,
                    named <hi rend="italic">graepach</hi> by the manufacturers, is interspersed with
                    it. As these kinds of ware are but seldom covered by the sea, they are short,
                    and only a little of them can be obtained. The <hi rend="italic">fucus
                    vesiculosus,</hi> or bell-ware, grows on that part of the shore between
                    high-water neap-tides and low-water neap-tides. From the circumstance of this
                    ware being alternately covered by the sea and exposed to the air for nearly the
                    same space of time, it grows stronger than any of the other varieties; is
                    consequently more plentiful, and most productive. That part of it which grows
                    near low-water-mark neap-tides is of a thinner texture, and is called
                    floating-ware, or <hi rend="italic">gleurach.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">fucus
                    serratus,</hi> or blackware, grows between low-water neap-tides and low-water
                    spring-tides; this variety of ware is plentiful on such shores as are flat, and
                    which only ebb with spring-tides. Black-ware makes good kelp, but is not so
                    productive, from its thin texture.</p>
                <p>“Different varieties of tangle-ware appear lower down than the black-ware at
                    low-water spring-tides, but are not cut for kelp-making in those parts, and are
                    only used when drifted ashore for making <hi rend="italic">cast-ware
                    kelp.</hi><hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> 4. The specimens of Strond kelp now
                    sent to the Society were taken without any pains of selection, from about 60
                    tons of the kelp; each specimen sent being taken from different kelp-kilns,
                    containing from 2 to 2½ tons of kelp each. All the kelp made on the farm was
                    equal in quality to the specimens sent, with the exception of about 6 tons,
                    which were made in a bay into which there is a run of fresh water, and where the
                    ware is only covered with salt water with spring-tides. Kelp made of such ware
                    contains less of the alkaline salts than when it is made from that which grows
                    on strong tide-ways.</p>
                <p>“5. The kelp from which the specimens were taken was sold by Messrs Macdonald and
                    Ravenscroft, agents, Liverpool, for L.10. 5s.</p>
                <p>“6. The process of manufacturing this kelp is as follows, and though similar, may
                    be found to differ in some respects from the general mode of kelp-making.
                    Wherein I consider this difference lies I will point out, by underscoring that
                    part of the description of the process.</p>
                <p>“1. The ware is cut off the rocks with a common hook, similar to that used for
                    shearing (reaping), but stronger, and having a rougher edge.</p>
                <p>“2. <hi rend="italic">Care is taken</hi> to land the ware on clean spreading
                    ground; and if any sand or mud is found to stick to the ware, <hi rend="italic"
                    >it is always washed</hi> before landing it.</p>
                <p>“3. The ware is spread out every dry day, and made into small cocks at night.
                    When in this way it is found to be pretty dry, <hi rend="italic">it is made into
                    larger cocks,</hi> and left to heat in them for <hi rend="italic">six</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> days; but if the ware is of that description which
                    I have mentioned above as growing in bays into which there is a run of water,
                    <hi rend="italic">suck ware is always left in large cocks for</hi> 15 or 20 <hi
                    rend="italic">days.</hi></p>
                <p>“4. <hi rend="italic">The ware being thus secured,</hi> a dry day with a good
                    breeze of wind is watched for, in order to burn it.</p>

                    facs="nls:193033670" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3670-0297"/> stones, of hard texture, and
                    built up carelessly; the outsides of the kilns are covered with turf; die length
                    of each kiln is from 15 to 18 feet, breadth 2½ feet, height 2 feet. They are
                    made on the surface of the ground, and on the firmest sward they can find.</p>
                <p>“6. The process of burning is as follows :— A small bundle of straw or heather is
                    set on fire; the dryest part of the ware is placed over this, and gradually
                    added, until the flames become general through the kiln; then the ware to be
                    burnt is thrown in, little by little, till the whole is reduced to ashes. If,
                    however, it happens that the day is too calm, or that the ware is not
                    sufficiently dry, so that the ashes cool and cake into white crusts, <hi
                    rend="italic">the manufacturer stops burning any more, until he rakes all the
                    ashes in the kiln</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> then commences burning again, and
                    goes on in this way until he has the whole thoroughly burnt. Want of attention
                    to this method leaves kelp of a white colour and porous texture.</p>
                <p>“7. The last process is the raking or working of the ashes, with an iron with a
                    wooden handle, made for the purpose, until the whole is brought into a solid
                    semi-vitrified state. Most manufacturers commence this process immediately after
                    the last part of the ware is put into the kiln, and when a good deal of the ware
                    is not sufficiently burnt, and of a black colour. The Strond manufacturers,
                    however, do not <hi rend="italic">commence raking</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ashes</hi> for at least half an hour after the last of the ware is put on, so
                    that the whole may be thoroughly burnt. Want of attention to this particular
                    leaves kelp of an ugly black colour.</p>
                <p>“The raking of the ashes is simply done by working the kclp-irons through it
                    until the whole becomes a semi-vitrified mass. <hi rend="italic">Three</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">four</hi> men are employed at this process; if fewer, the
                    ashes will not be sufficiently worked, and consequently a great part of them
                    must be mixed in the next burning.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Finally,</hi> The kelp is broken into
                    pieces of about 2 cwt.; these are made into conical heaps, covered with dry
                    ware, and over that is placed a layer of turf, which secures the kelp tolerably
                    well, if early shipped.”</p>
                <p>9. Sea-grass <hi rend="italic">(zostera marina)</hi> is a plant which abounds in
                    the Orkney Islands, and has lately come into use for stuffing chairs,
                    mattresses, and other sorts of furniture in which horse-hair was formerly used.
                    When properly prepared, it is found to be elastic and durable, and is not
                    subject to the attacks of those insects which often infest mattresses made of
                    wool or cotton.</p>
                <p>The following account of this plant is taken from the <hi rend="italic">Prize
                    Essays and Transactions of the Highland Society,</hi> vol. vi. and was written
                    in 1823.</p>
                <p>“The zostera generally grows at such depths as to be left nearly dry by the
                    ebbing of spring-tides.</p>
                <p>“The leaves remain attached to the stem until the month of September, and during
                    the autumn and beginning of winter are thrown ashore in large quantities.</p>
                <p>“As this plant floats near the surface of the water, it is always driven <hi
                    rend="italic">before</hi> the wind; unlike the other marine plants of these
                    islands, which (with the exception of <hi rend="italic">fucus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vesiculosus,</hi> whose air-vessels keep it afloat) remain near
                    the bottom, and are forced ashore, <hi rend="italic">against</hi> the wind, by
                    the ground-swell or reflux of the waves.</p>
                <p>“The sea-grass is used by the inhabitants of these islands as manure for their
                    fields, for which purpose it is either gathered into heaps with other marine
                    plants, and allowed to ferment before being applied to the land, or formed into
                    compost with earth, litter, &amp;c.; in both of which ways it is found to answer
                    well.</p>
                <p>“It is also used by the poorer classes of labourers or cottars as thatch for
                    their houses, and in this way forms a good defence against the violent winds and
                    heavy rains of their rude climate, for two years.</p>
                <p>“Its application as a substitute for horse-hair, in stuffing mattresses and
                    furniture, was unknown in these islands until the attention of a few individuals
                    was devoted to it by the offer of a premium by the Highland Society of Scotland,
                    for its preservation for that purpose, and with a view to its introduction as a
                    useful article of manufacture.</p>
                <p>“The list of premiums offered by the society happening to come into the hands of
                    the writer of this brief and imperfect sketch during last autumn, he conceived
                    he might employ some of his people profitably in collecting, washing, and drying
                    the grass for sale. The season being unluckily too far advanced for procuring
                    any large quantity, he prepared, by way of experiment, 1 ton 3 cwts. 14 lbs.
                    which his agent has since sold to the manager of the Asylum for the Industrious
                    Blind at Edinburgh, at the rate of 12s. 9d. per cwt. On this quantity, which
                    grossed L.14. 15s. his net profit did not exceed L.8; but this partly arose from
                    inexperience in the mode of preparing it. On a quantity amounting to nearly
                    three tons, which he has got ready for market within these few weeks, the
                    expenses of washing, drying, and picking, have not amounted to more than half of
                    the charge on the smaller quantity first noticed. The first was carefully washed
                    twice in vessels filled with fresh water, and dried quickly, and then any
                    sea-weed that had floated ashore with it picked out when dry. The last was
                    carted to a freshwater lake, and steeped during a week, when it was taken out,
                    and picked by boys and young girls while spread wet upon the ground. If properly
                    steeped, exposure to drought for one day will make it sufficiently dry for
                    packing. WTιen dry, care must be taken, if the weather is windy, to gather it
                    into heaps or cocks, otherwise it may be blown away, being then extremely light.
                    The first quantity prepared was sent to market in large bags of sacking, of the
                    size of wool-packages, very hard packed; yet that small quantity required 14
                    bags to contain it. The last has been twisted into ropes, of the thickness of a
                    man’s waist, and then compactly made up in nets formed of ropes made of
                    bent-grass.</p>
                <p>“The zostera is a plant of a very imperishable nature, and may be kept for any
                    length of time in fresh or salt water, without any apparent decay. Should a
                    sufficient demand arise for this grass, at a fair price, any quantity could be
                    collected in the Orkney Islands that the market could require; and it would
                    furnish a species of labour well adapted to old people past hard work, and young
                    people not yet able for hard work. The wages generally given for such sort of
                    work at present is 6d. per day, which is more than can be earned by plaiting
                    straw, the staple employment of young people in the Orkney Islands.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Succession of
                    Crops.</hi></p>
                <p>There is no branch of husbandry that requires more judgment, nor any on which the
                    profits of the farmer more depend, than the order in which the several crops
                    cultivated are made to succeed one another. The general rule is, that
                    culmiferous crops, ripening their seeds, should not be repeated, without the
                    intervention of pulse, roots, herbage, or fallow. This rule is recognised in the
                    practice<pb break="no" facs="nls:193033683" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3683-0298"/> and
                    writings of all judicious cultivators, more generally, perhaps, than any other
                    in the whole compass of the art of agriculture.</p>
                <p>With regard to the particular plants that enter into the course of cropping,
                    these, it is evident, must be such as are suited to the soil and climate, though
                    they will be somewhat varied by local circumstances, such as the proximity of
                    towns and villages, where there is a greater demand for turnips, potatoes, hay,
                    &amp;c. than in thinly peopled districts. In general, beans, and clover with
                    ryegrass, are interposed between corn crops on clayey soils, and turnips,
                    potatoes, and clover and ryegrass, on dry loams and sands, or what are
                    technically known by the name of turnip soils. A variety of other plants, such
                    as peas, tares, cabbages, and carrots, occupy a part, though commonly but a
                    small part, of that division of a farm which is allotted to green crops. This
                    order of succession is called the system of <hi rend="italic">alternate
                    husbandry</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and on rich soils, or such as have access
                    to abundance of putrescent manure, it is certainly the most productive of all,
                    both in food for man and for the inferior animals. One half of a farm is, in
                    this course, always under some of the different species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cereal</hi><hi rend="italic">gramina,</hi> and the other half under pulse,
                    roots, cultivated herbage, or plain fallow.</p>
                <p>But the greater part of the arable land of Britain cannot be maintained in a
                    fertile state under this management; and sandy soils, even though highly
                    manured, soon become too incohesive under a course of constant tillage. It
                    therefore becomes necessary to leave that division, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >break,</hi> that carries cultivated herbage, to be pastured for two years or
                    more, according to the degree of its consistency and fertility; and all the
                    fields of a farm are treated thus in their turn, if they require it/ This is
                    called the system of <hi rend="italic">convertible husbandry</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> a regular change being constantly going on from aration to
                    pasturage, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>
                <p>Another rule with regard to the succession of crops, is not to repeat the same
                    kind of crop at too short intervals. Whatever may be the cause,—whether it is to
                    be sought for in the nature of the soil, or of the plants themselves, experience
                    clearly proves the advantages of introducing a diversity of species into every
                    course of cropping. When land is pastured several years before it is brought
                    again under the plough, there may be less need for adhering steadily to this
                    rule; but the degeneracy of wheat and other corn crops recurring upon the same
                    land every second year for a long period, has been very generally acknowledged.
                    It is the same with what are called green crops; beans and peas, potatoes,
                    turnips, and in an especial manner red clover, become all of them much less
                    productive, and much more liable to disease, when they come into the course,
                    upon the same land, every second, third, or fourth year. But what the interval
                    ought to be has not yet been determined, and (from the great num· ber of years
                    that experiments must be continued to give any certain result) probably cannot
                    be determined, until the component parts of soils, and particularly the sort of
                    vegetable nourishment which each species of plants extracts from the soil, have
                    been more fully investigated.</p>
                <p>A change of the <hi rend="italic">variety,</hi> as well as of the <hi
                    rend="italic">species,</hi> and . even of the plants of the same variety, is
                    found to be attended with advantage; and in the latter case, or a change of
                    seed, the species and variety being the same, the practice is almost universal.
                    It is well known, that of two parcels of wheat, for instance, as much alike in
                    quality as possible, the one, which had grown on a soil differing much from that
                    on which it is to be sown, will yield a better produce than the other that grew
                    in the same, or a similar soil and climate. The farmers of Scotland, accord
                    ingly, find that wheat from the south, even though it be not, as it -usually is,
                    better than their own, is a very advantageous change; and oats and other grain,
                    brought from a clayey to a sandy soil, other things being equal, are more
                    productive than such as grew on the sandy soil</p>
                <p>With these general remarks we proceed to mention the most approved rotations on
                    the two general classes of soil, namely, what are called heavy and light, or
                    clay and turnip soils.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Rotations on Clay Soils.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already endeavoured to establish the necessity of a naked or summer
                    fallow on land of this description; and beginning with this as the commencement
                    of the course, one of the most approved rotations is,—</p>
                <p>1. Fallow with manure;</p>
                <p>2. Wheat with seeds;</p>
                <p>3. Red clover with ryegrass;</p>
                <p>4. Oats;</p>
                <p>5. Beans drilled and horse-hoed;</p>
                <p>6. Wheat.</p>
                <p>In this course, manure should be applied either to the clover stubble before it
                    is broken up for oats, or before the beans are sown.</p>
                <p>This rotation has been found to answer on clayey soils generally, but upon those
                    of a superior quality it may be extended to eight years. In that case the order
                    of the crops is,—</p>
                <p>1. Fallow;</p>
                <p>2. Wheat;</p>
                <p>3. Beans;</p>
                <p>4. Barley;</p>
                <p>5. Red clover and ryegrass;</p>
                <p>6. Oats;</p>
                <p>7. Beans; and</p>
                <p>8. Wheat.</p>
                <p>Upon soils of an inferior description, or thin clays, a four years course
                    is,—</p>
                <p>1. Fallow with manure;</p>
                <p>2. Wheat;</p>
                <p>3. Red clover and ryegrass;</p>
                <p>4. Oats; and it is considered an improvement on this course to let the clover and
                    ryegrass division stand to be pastured for two or three years. In that case the
                    ryegrass should be of the perennial description; and white clover must be added
                    to the red in an equal or greater proportion.</p>
                <p>In particular situations, where the soil is either very rich or can be abundantly
                    supplied with manure, it has been found profitable to cultivate wheat and beans,
                    and wheat and potatoes, for several years in succession.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Turnip Soils.</hi></p>
                <p>On the best description of such soils as do not require a naked fallow, but which
                    admit of turnips being grown and consumed upon the ground, a favourite rotation
                    is,—</p>
                <p>1. Turnips, of which at least two-thirds should be eaten by sheep where they
                    grow;</p>
                <p>2. Spring wheat or barley, sown from time to time as the turnips are cleared
                    away;</p>
                <p>3. Clover and ryegrass;</p>
                <p>4. Wheat.</p>
                <p>On land of a medium quality, and without an extrasupply of manure, this has been
                    found a very exhausting course, and ought not to be persisted in. Instead of
                    taking two crops of wheat in the four years, it is better to take only one of
                    wheat and one of barley; and the greater part of the clover and ryegrass should,
                    as indeed is usually the case, be pastured the first year, instead of being cut
                    for hay.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033696" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3696-0299"/>
                <p>By much the greater proportion of turnip soils, however, do not admit even of
                    this modified course, but require, after being sown with grass-seeds, to be
                    retained in pasture for two or more years. The most common period we believe is
                    three years, but upon sandy soils it is better to continue the land, in
                    pasturage for five or six years; and on land of this description wheat should
                    not be attempted at all. The rotation would then be,—</p>
                <p>1. Turnips, to be nearly all consumed on the ground;</p>
                <p>2. Barley;</p>
                <p>3. Red and white clover, with perennial ryegrass, to which is sometimes added
                    ribwort <hi rend="italic">(plantago</hi><hi rend="italic">lanceolatα)</hi> and
                    other seeds suited to such soils; the land to be continued in pasture for at
                    least three years, and broken up with,</p>
                <p>4. Oats or rye; the latter will often be found the more profitable.</p>
                <p>The general rule in all these cases is, that culmiferous crops ripening their
                    seeds must never follow one another without the intervention of a fallow, or a
                    cleansing and ameliorating crop.</p>
                <p>Though these be the rotations most generally approved by our best farmers, yet
                    deviations from them may be permitted in particular cases without injury either
                    to the soil or the cultivator. In the neighbourhood of large towns, and in other
                    situations where an abundant supply of manure can be obtained, the crops are not
                    only varied in the order of succession, but others may be''Substituted for some
                    of those before mentioned. Thus, potatoes near large towns are often found more
                    profitable than turnip, as they serve to prepare the land for wheat, which is
                    almost always the next crop. And it is to be understood that peas, potatoes,
                    cabbages, rape, and other green crops, are not to be considered as excluded from
                    the general rotations; on the contrary, it is usual 'to sow a small proportion
                    of peas along with the beans, and to allot part of the division under turnips
                    for potatoes, rape, &amp;c. ç but those we have mentioned occupy the greater
                    part of each division.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Manures.</hi></p>
                <p>Under this head we shall notice the several substances most extensively employed,
                    with their management and application, without going into detail as to the
                    various articles of this kind that are to be procured only in small quantities,
                    or in particular situations, and which are therefore used on a very limited
                    scale.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Farm-yard Dung.</hi></p>
                <p>This manure, composed chiefly of the straw of grain, and the excrementitious
                    substances of live stock, is the principal, and in most instances the only
                    fertilizer of the soil to which farmers have access. Its use is so universal and
                    so well known, that a very few observations will suffice.</p>
                <p>As straw is the basis of this compost, every judicious farmer takes care to have
                    his crops cut as low as possible, as it is evident to every one that a few
                    inches of straw towards the root-end adds much to the weight of the crop. From
                    every ton of dry straw about three tons of farm-yard dung may be obtained, if
                    the after-management be properly conducted; and as the weight of straw per acre
                    runs from 1 ton to 1½, about 4 tons of dung, on an average of the different
                    crops, may be produced from the straw of every acre under corn. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Husbandry of Scotland,</hi> vol. ii.)</p>
                <p>The straw is served out to cattle and horses in the houses and fold-yards, either
                    as provender or litter, commonly for both purposes; and turnips in winter, and
                    green clover in summer, on which food the animals pass a great deal of urine,
                    afford the means of converting the straw into a richer manure than if it were
                    all eaten by itself.</p>
                <p>All the dung from the houses, as they are cleaned out, ought to be regularly
                    spread over the yards, in which young cattle are left loose, where litter is
                    usually allowed in great abundance; or over the dunghill itself, if there be one
                    at hand. This renders the quality of the whole mass more uniform; and the
                    horse-dung, which is of a hot nature, promotes the decomposition of the woody
                    fibres of the straw.</p>
                <p>At a convenient season, usually during the frosts of winter, this mass of
                    materials is carted out to the field to which it is to be applied, and neatly
                    built in dunghills of a square form, three or four feet high, and of such a
                    length and breadth as circumstances may require. What is laid up in this manner
                    early in winter is commonly sufficiently prepared for turnips in June; but if it
                    be not carried from the straw-yards till spring, it is necessary to turn it once
                    or oftener, for the purpose of accelerating the decomposition of the strawy part
                    of the mass. When dung is applied to fallows in July or August, preparatory to
                    autumn-sown wheat, a much Jess degree of putrefaction will suffice than for
                    turnips—a clay soil, on which alone fallows should ever be resorted to, not
                    requiring dung so much rotted as a finely pulverized turnip soil; and besides,
                    as the wheat does not need all the benefit of the dung for some time, the woody
                    fibre is gradually broken down in the course of the winter, and the nourishment
                    of the plants continued till spring or later, when its effects are most
                    beneficial.</p>
                <p>In the application of dung to land under tillage, particular attention should be
                    paid to the cleanness of the soil, and to use it at the time when, from the
                    pulverization of the ground, it may be most intimately mixed with it. The most
                    common time of manuring with farm-yard dung is, therefore, either towards the
                    conclusion of the fallowing operations, or immediately before the sowing of
                    fallow crops. If no dung can be procured but what is made from the produce of
                    the farm, it will seldom be possible to allow more than ten or twelve tons to
                    every acre, when the land is managed under a regular course of white and green
                    crops; and it is thought more advantageous to repeat this dose at short
                    intervals, than to give a larger quantity at once, and at a more distant period
                    in proportion. <hi rend="italic">( General Report of Scotland,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    517.)</p>
                <p>Farm-yard dung, it is well known, is greatly reduced in value by being exposed to
                    the atmosphere in small heaps previous to being spread, and still more after
                    being spread. Its rich juices are exhaled by the sun, or washed away by the
                    rains, and the residuum is comparatively worthless. This is in an especial
                    manner the case with long fresh dung, the far greater part of which consists of
                    wet straw in an entire state. All careful farmers, accordingly, spread and cover
                    in their dung with the plough as soon as possible after it is brought on the
                    land.</p>
                <p>It has been urged by a celebrated chemist, that farmyard dung ought not to be
                    allowed to ferment in any considerable degree, as during a violent fermentation
                    a large quantity not only of fluid but likewise of gaseous matter is lost,
                    which, if retained by the moisture in the soil, would be capable of becoming a
                    useful nourishment to plants. He therefore recommends that it should be applied
                    after a slight incipient fermentation, which he admits to be useful in bringing
                    on a disposition in the woody fibre to decay and dissolve; and this is always,
                    he adds, in great excess in the refuse of a farm. (Davy’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agricultural Chemistry,</hi> p. 302. 8vo.)</p>
                <p>From a recent publication <hi rend="italic">(Husbandry of Scotland</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193033709" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3709-0300"/> vol. i. p. 174),
                    the practice of the best farmers of turnip soils in Scotland appears to be
                    decidedly adverse to the use of fresh dung; and its inutility, or rather
                    injurious effects, from its opening the soil too much, is a matter of experience
                    with every one who cultivates drilled turnips on a large scale. As the whole
                    farm-yard dung on such land is applied to the turnip crop, it must necessarily
                    happen that it should be laid on in different stages of putrefaction; and what
                    is made very late in spring, often after a very slight fermentation, or none at
                    all. The experience of the effects of recent dung is accordingly very general,
                    and the result in almost every case is, that the growth of the young plants is
                    slow,—that they remain long in a feeble and doubtful state,—and that they
                    seldom, in ordinary seasons, become a full crop, even though twice the quantity
                    that is given of short <hi rend="italic">muck</hi> has been allowed.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, when the manure is considerably decomposed, the effects are
                    immediate, the plants rise vigorously, and soon put forth their <hi
                    rend="italic">rough</hi> leaf, after which the beetle or fly does not seize on
                    them; and in a few weeks the leaves become so large, that the plants probably
                    draw the greater part of their nourishment from the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Though it were true, therefore, that more nutritive matter were given out by a
                    certain quantity of dung applied in a recent state, and allowed to decompose
                    gradually in the soil, than if applied after undergoing fermentation and
                    putrefaction, the objection arising from the slowness of its operation would, in
                    many instances, be an insuperable one with farmers.</p>
                <p>But there seems reason to doubt whether fresh strawy manure would ferment much in
                    the soil, after being spread out in so small a quantity as has been already
                    mentioned; and also, whether in the warm dry weather of summer, the shallow
                    covering of earth given by the plough would not permit the gaseous matters to
                    escape to a much greater amount than if fermentation had been completed in a
                    well-built covered dunghill.</p>
                <p>Another great objection to the use of fresh farm-yard dung is, that the seeds and
                    roots of those plants with which it commonly abounds spring up luxuriantly on
                    the land; and this evil nothing but a considerable degree of fermentation can
                    obviate. The mass of materials consists of the straw of various crops, some of
                    the grains of which, after all the care that can be taken, will adhere to the
                    straw,—of the dung of different animals, voided, as is often the case with
                    horses fed on oats, with the grain in an entire state,—and of the roots, stems,
                    and seeds of the weeds that had grown among the straw, clover, and hay, and such
                    as had been brought to the houses and foldyards with the turnips and other roots
                    given to live stock.</p>
                <p>No rule of universal application can be laid down on this subject; the degree of
                    decomposition to which farmyard dung should arrive before it can be deemed a
                    profitable manure, must depend on the texture of the soil, the nature of the
                    plants, and the time of its application. In general, clayey soils, more
                    tenacious of moisture, and more benefited by being rendered incohesive and
                    porous, may receive manure less decomposed than well-pulverized turnip soils
                    require. Some plants, too, seem to thrive better with fresh dung than
                    others,—potatoes in particular; but all the small-seeded plants, such as
                    turnips, clover, carrots, &amp;c. which are extremely tender in the early stage
                    of their growth, require to be pushed forward into luxuriant vegetation with the
                    least possible delay, by means of short dung. The season when manure is applied
                    is also a material circumstance. In spring and summer, whether it be used for
                    corn or green crops, the object is to produce an immediate effect, and it should
                    therefore be more completely decomposed than may be necessary when it is laid on
                    in autumn for a crop whose condition will be almost stationary for several
                    months.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Lime.</hi></p>
                <p>Next to farm-yard dung, lime is in most general use ash a manure, though it is
                    one of a quite different character; and when judiciously applied, and the land
                    laid to pasture, or cultivated for white and green crops alternately, with an
                    adequate allowance of putrescent manure, its effects are much more lasting, and
                    in many instances still more beneficial, than those of farm-yard dung. Fossil
                    manures “must produce their effect, either by becoming a constituent part of the
                    plant, or by acting upon its more essential food, so as to render it more fitted
                    for the purposes of vegetable life.” (Davy’s <hi rend="italic">Agricultural
                    Chemistry,</hi> p. 314.) It is perhaps in the former of these ways that wheat
                    and some other plants are brought to perfection after lime has been applied upon
                    land that would not bring them to maturity by the most liberal use of dung
                    alone.</p>
                <p>“The most common form in which lime is found on the surface of the earth, is in a
                    state of combination with carbonic acid or fixed air. If a piece of limestone or
                    chalk be thrown into a fluid acid, there will be an effervescence. This is owing
                    to the escape of the carbonic acid gas. The lime becomes dissolved in the
                    liquor. When limestone is strongly heated, the carbonic acid gas is expelled,
                    and then nothing remains but the pure alkaline earth; in this case there is a
                    loss of weight, and if the fire has been very high, it approaches to one-half
                    the weight of the stone; but in common cases, limestones, if well dried before
                    burning, do not lose much more than from 35 to 40 per cent., or from seven to
                    eight parts out of twenty. When burned lime becomes mild, it regains its power
                    of effervescing, and is the same chemical substance as chalk or limestone.</p>
                <p>“When newly burned lime is exposed to air, it soon falls into powder; in this
                    case it is called slacked lime; and the same effect is immediately produced by
                    throwing water upon it, when it heats violently and the water disappears.
                    Slacked lime is merely a combination of lime with about one-third of its weight
                    of water, that is, 55 parts of lime absorb 17 parts of water.</p>
                <p>“When lime, whether freshly burned or slacked, is mixed with any moist fibrous
                    vegetable matter, there is a strong action between the lime and the vegetable
                    matter, and they form a kind of compost together, of which apart is usually
                    soluble in water. By this kind of operation, lime renders matter which was
                    before comparatively inert nutritive; and as charcoal and oxygen abound in all
                    vegetable matters, it becomes at the same time converted into carbonate of
                    lime.</p>
                <p>“Mild lime, powdered limestone, marls, or chalks, have no action of this kind
                    upon vegetable matter; by their action they prevent the too rapid decomposition
                    of substances already dissolved, but they have no tendency to form soluble
                    matters.</p>
                <p>“It is obvious, from these circumstances, that the operation of quicklime and
                    marl or chalk depends upon principles altogether different. Quicklime, in being
                    applied to land, tends to bring any hard vegetable matter that it contains into
                    a state of more rapid decomposition and solution, so as to render it a proper
                    food for plants. Chalk and marl, or carbonate of lime, will only improve the
                    texture of the soil, or its relation to absorption; it acts merely as one of its
                    earthy ingredients. Quicklime, when it becomes mild, operates in the same manner
                    as chalk; but, in the act of becoming mild, it prepares soluble out of insoluble
                    matter.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033722" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3722-0301"/>
                <p>"The solution of the question, whether quicklime ought to be applied to a soil,
                    depends upon the quantity of inert vegetable matters that it contains. The
                    solution of the question, whether marl, mild lime, or powdered limestone, ought
                    to be applied, depends upon the quantity of calcareous matter already in the
                    soil. All soils are improved by mild lime, and ultimately by quicklime, which do
                    not effervesce with acids, and sands more than clays." (Davy’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agricultural Chemistry,</hi> p. 315, <hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >seq.)</hi></p>
                <p>From the mode in which lime operates, it necessarily follows that quicklime
                    should not be applied to lands that contain much soluble matter, nor be mixed up
                    in composts with animal manures.</p>
                <p>“It had been long known to farmers in the neighbourhood of Doncaster, that lime
                    made from a certain limestone, applied to the land, often injured the crops
                    considerably. Mr Tennant, in making a series of experiments upon this peculiar
                    calcareous substance, found that it contained magnesia; and on mixing some
                    calcined magnesia with soil, in which he sowed different seeds, he found that
                    they either died, or vegetated in a very imperfect manner, and the plants were
                    never healthy. And, with great justice and ingenuity, he referred the bad
                    effects of the peculiar limestone to the magnesian earth it contains.” (Zrf. p.
                    322.) Yet it is advantageously employed in small quantities, seldom more than 25
                    or 30 bushels to the acre. A simple test of magnesia in the limestone is the
                    circumstance of its effervescing little when plunged into an acid, and its
                    rendering diluted nitric acid or aquafortis milky. Stones of this kind are
                    usually coloured brown or pale yellow, and are found in several counties of
                    England, and in many parts of Ireland, particularly near Belfast.</p>
                <p>With regard to the quantity of lime that ought to be applied to different soils,
                    it is much to be regretted that Sir Humphry Davy did not enter fully into the
                    subject. Clays, it is well known, require a larger quantity than sands or dry
                    loams. It has been applied, accordingly, in almost every quantity from 100 to
                    500 bushels or upwards per acre. About 160 bushels are· generally considered a
                    full dressing for lighter soils, and 80 or 100 bushels more for heavy cohesive
                    soils.</p>
                <p>In the application of lime to arable land, there are some general rules commonly
                    attended to by diligent farmers, of which we shall present an abstract.</p>
                <p>1. As the effects of lime greatly depend on its intimate admixture with the
                    surface soil, it is essential to have it in a powdery state at the time it is
                    applied.</p>
                <p>2. Lime having a tendency to sink in the soil, it should be ploughed in with a
                    shallow furrow.</p>
                <p>3. Lime may either be applied to grass land, or to land in preparation for green
                    crops or summer fallow, with almost equal advantage; but, in general, the latter
                    mode of application is to be preferred.</p>
                <p>4. Lime ought not to be applied a second time to moorish soils, unless mixed up
                    as a compost; after which the land should be immediately laid down to grass.</p>
                <p>5. Upon fresh land, the effect of lime is much superior to that of dung. The
                    ground, likewise, more especially where it is of a strong nature, is more easily
                    cultivated; in some instances, it is said, “the saving of labour would be
                    sufficient to induce a farmer to lime his land, were no greater benefit derived
                    from the application than the opportunity thereby gained of working it in a more
                    perfect manner/’ (<hi rend="italic">General Report of Scotland,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    536.)</p>
                <p>In improving hilly land with a view to pasture, a much smaller quantity of lime
                    has been found to produce permanent and highly beneficial effects, when kept as
                    much as possible near the surface, by being merely harrowed in with the seeds,
                    after a fallow or green crop, instead of being buried by the plough. As this is
                    a matter of much importance to farmers of such land, especially when lime must
                    be brought from a great distance, as was the case in the instance to which we
                    are about to allude, the successful practice of one of the most eminent farmers
                    in Britain cannot be too generally known.</p>
                <p>“A few years after 1754,” says Mr Dawson, “having a considerable extent of
                    outfield land in fallow, which I wished to lime previous to its being laid down
                    to pasture, and finding that I could not obtain a sufficient quantity of lime
                    for the whole in proper time, I was induced, from observing the effects of fine
                    loam upon the surface of similar soil, even when covered with bent, to try a
                    small quantity of lime on the surface of this fallow, instead of a larger
                    quantity ploughed down in the usual manner. Accordingly, in the autumn, about
                    twenty acres of it were well harrowed, and then about fifty-six Winchester
                    bushels only, of unslacked lime, were, after being slacked, carefully spread
                    upon each English acre, and immediately well harrowed in. As many pieces of the
                    lime, which had not been fully slacked at first, were gradually reduced to
                    powder by the dews and moisture of the earth,—to mix these with the soil, the
                    land was again well harrowed in three or four days thereafter. This land was
                    sown in the spring with oats, with white and red clover and ryegrass seeds, and
                    well harrowed, without being ploughed again. The crop of oats was good, the
                    plants of grass sufficiently numerous and healthy; and they formed a very fine
                    pasture, which continued good until ploughed some years after for corn.</p>
                <p>“About twelve years afterwards I took a lease of the hilly farm of Grubbet, many
                    parts of which, though of an earthy mould tolerably deep, were too steep and
                    elevated to be kept in tillage. As these lands had been much exhausted by
                    cropping, and were full of couchgrass, to destroy that and procure a cover of
                    fine grass, I fallowed them, and laid on the same quantity of lime per acre,
                    then harrowed and sowed oats and grass-seeds in the spring, exactly as in the
                    last mentioned experiment. The oats were a full crop, and the plants of grass
                    abundant. Several of these fields have been now above thirty years in pasture,
                    and are still producing white clover and other fine grasses: no bent or fog has
                    yet appeared upon them. It deserves particular notice, that more than <hi
                    rend="italic">treble</hi> the quantity of lime was laid upon fields adjoining of
                    a similar soil, but which being fitter for occasional tillage, upon them the
                    lime was ploughed in. These fields were also sown with oats and grass-seeds. The
                    latter throve well, and gave a fine pasture the first year; but afterwards the
                    bent spread so fast, that in three years there was more of it than of the finer
                    grasses.”</p>
                <p>The conclusions which Mr Dawson draws from his extensive practice in the use of
                    lime and dung, deserve the attention of all cultivators of similar land.</p>
                <p>“1. That animal dung dropt upon coarse benty pastures produces little or no
                    improvement upon them; and that, even when sheep or cattle are confined to a
                    small space, as in the case of folding, their dung ceases to produce any
                    beneficial effect after a few years, whether the land is continued in pasture or
                    brought under the plough.</p>
                <p>“2. That even when land of this description is well fallowed and dunged, but not
                    limed, though the dung augments the produce of the subsequent crop of grain, and
                    of grass also for two or three years, that thereafter its effects are no longer
                    discernible either upon the one or the other</p>
                <p>“3. That when this land is limed, if the lime is kept upon the surface of the
                    soil, or well mixed with it, and then laid down to pasture, the finer grasses
                    continue in possession of the soil, even in elevated and exposed situations<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193033735" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3735-0302"/>, for a great many
                    years, to the exclusion of bent and fog. In the case of Grubbet-hills, it was
                    observed, that more than thirty years have now elapsed. Besides this, the dung
                    of the animals pastured upon such land adds every year to the luxuriance, and
                    improves the quality of the pasture, and augments the productive powers of the
                    soil when afterwards ploughed for grain; thus producing, upon a benty outfield
                    soil, effects similar to what are experienced when rich infield lands have been
                    long in pasture, and which are thereby more and more enriched.</p>
                <p>“4. That when a large quantity of lime is laid on such land, and ploughed down
                    deep, the same effects will not be produced, whether in respect to the permanent
                    fineness of the pasture, its gradual amelioration by the dung of the animals
                    depastured on it, or its fertility when afterwards in tillage. On the contrary,
                    unless the surface is fully mixed with lime, the coarse grasses will in a few
                    years regain possession of the soil, and the dung thereafter deposited by cattle
                    will not enrich the land for subsequent tillage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Lastly,</hi> It also appears from what
                    has been stated, that the four-shift husbandry is only proper for very rich
                    land, or in situations where there is a full command of dung; that by far the
                    greatest part of the land of this country requires to be continued in grass two,
                    three, four, or more years, according to its natural poverty; that the objection
                    made to this, viz. that the coarse grasses in a few years usurp possession of
                    the soil, must be owing to the surface soil not being sufficiently mixed with
                    lime, the lime having been covered too deep by the plough.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Farmers Magazine,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 69.)</p>
                <p>Limestones differ much in purity, or in the quantity of calcareous matter which
                    they contain. According to Mr Headrick <hi rend="italic">(Farmers Magazine,</hi>
                    vol. v. p. 451) it is usually from 60 to 85 per cent.; but he afterwards
                    analyzed some limestones from the county of Fife, which contained 99½ per cent,
                    of carbonate of lime, the residuum being fine clay. Farmers generally estimate
                    the purity of limestones by the quantity of slacked lime produced from a given
                    quantity of burnt limestone, or shells as it is usually called, the pulverized
                    lime of the best shells being three times the measure of the shells. But it is
                    easy to ascertain the quantity of calcareous matter, in the stone itself, by the
                    use of muriatic acid; that stone being the best which leaves the least sediment,
                    the lime itself dissolving in the acid.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Marls.</hi></p>
                <p>Marl, which was more extensively employed as a manure in former times than it has
                    been of late, since the properties of lime have been better understood, is
                    usually divided into <hi rend="italic">stone, clay,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >shell</hi> marl, of which the last is the most valuable. All marls contain a
                    portion of calcareous matter, and their operation is not materially different
                    from that of mild lime, as has been formerly noticed; but the greater quantity
                    required, owing to the smaller proportion of calcareous matter which they
                    contain, confines the use of them to a few miles around the places where they
                    are found. The effects of marl are slower than those of quicklime, but, from the
                    earthy substances combined with the calcareous matter, and the larger quantity
                    usually applied, the staple of the soil is deepened, and the benefit is
                    considered more durable.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Sea-Weed.</hi></p>
                <p>This is an excellent manure, though not lasting in its effects, suited to all
                    soils and crops, with the exception perhaps of clovers of the first year’s
                    growth. It should be applied fresh as it is gathered, if the land be ready to re
                    ceive it, otherwise it maybe mixed’up with fresh dung, or used as a top-dressing
                    to grass-lands.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Bones and Homs.</hi></p>
                <p>Bones are a source of manure too little attended to in most places, though their
                    value is well ascertained by a pretty extensive experience of their effects in
                    several districts. The following particulars were transmitted from Yorkshire, in
                    answer to some queries proposed by the writer of this article.</p>
                <p>“1. It is thought that all the bones of every animal are <hi rend="italic"
                    >not</hi> equally valuable; but all the bones of an animal suitable for manure
                    are equally good, and are much better when fresh.</p>
                <p>“2. The bones which are best filled with oil and marrow are certainly the best
                    manure; and the parts generally used for buttons and knife-hafts are the thigh
                    and shank-bones.</p>
                <p>“3. The <hi rend="italic">powdered</hi> bones are dearer, and generally used for
                    hot-beds in gardens, being too expensive for the field, and not so durable a
                    manure as <hi rend="italic">bruised</hi> bones, though for a short time more
                    productive.</p>
                <p>“4. A dry, light or gentle soil, is best adapted for the use of bone manure, as
                    it is supposed that, in land which retains wet, the nutritive part of the bone
                    washes to the surface of it, and does not incorporate sufficiently with the
                    soil.</p>
                <p>“5. The autumn is the most proper time for the use of this manure, which should
                    then be laid on fallows for a turnip crop. The powder only should be used on a
                    green crop, as the bruised bones would interrupt the progress of the scythe.</p>
                <p>“6. The effects produced on different crops arc generally good on such soil as
                    named in No. 4.</p>
                <p>“7. Bruised bones are better when mixed with ashes or any other manure, as the
                    juicé of the bones is then more equally spread over the field.</p>
                <p>“8. Bone manure ought to be ploughed into the land in tillage. On grass, the
                    powder should be sown in by the hand.</p>
                <p>“9. This manure is used on land before described, to the extent of several
                    thousand acres, in the <hi rend="italic">higher</hi> parts of Nottinghamshire,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">wolds</hi> (or high land) in Lincolnshire, and the
                    East and West Riding of Yorkshire.</p>
                <p>“10. The primary object of keeping a bone mill is the bruising of bones, which
                    pays better, than selecting and selling such as are suitable for buttons,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>“11. In an agricultural district, where the generality of the land is of the
                    nature before mentioned as best suited for bone manure, a mill for the purpose
                    of bruising bones would certainly indemnify the proprietors. The cost of a mill
                    is from L.10Ò to L.200. As to the number of miles the manure may be carried, the
                    proprietors of the mill will be best able to judge of that.” See Plate X.</p>
                <p>The use of bones as a manure has been only recently introduced into Scotland; but
                    the experiments, as far as they have gone, are highly satisfactory, and the
                    practice is rapidly extending.</p>
                <p>The following account of some of these experiments, extracted from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Quarterly Journal of Agriculture,</hi> is given by the gentleman
                    who made them, Mr Watson of Keillor, near Cupar-Angus, in a communication dated
                    in February 1828. Mr Watson obtained bone manure for two acres in 1821, the
                    greatest quantity recommended being 25 bushels for the Scotish acre. “This,”
                    says he, “I applied, the following turnip-sowing season, to two acres of a field
                    of sharp black land on this farm, and on two adjoining acres of the same field I
                    applied 25 cart-loads per acre of well-made farm-yard dung. The season, at time
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033748" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3748-0303"/>of sowing, was
                    rather wet, and not very favourable for the first growth of turnips. Those with
                    bones came above ground on the third day very dark coloured and broad in the
                    leaf, and by the tenth day they were all in the rough blade. At this time I
                    examined the state of the manure, and found it one mass of maggots; but two days
                    after they were all dead; and the weather being now dry and warm, the most rapid
                    vegetation I ever remarked took place; so that by the fifteenth day from time of
                    sowing, the turnips were fully strong for being thinned out. This operation I
                    had performed by women, pulling out the spare plants with their hands (being
                    afraid to remove any part of the manure from the roots of the plants); but I
                    have since found that the common turnip-hoe, carefully used, does the work very
                    well, and leaves the manure undisturbed.</p>
                <p>“The plants where the farm-yard dung was applied did not come up till the fifth
                    day, and the turnips were twenty days sown before they were fit for being
                    thinned. By this time the bone turnips were meeting on the top βf the drill, and
                    they continued to maintain the advantage of their first start until the month of
                    September, which set in rather dry. At this time I anticipated that the bones
                    would be exhausted, and the crop stop growing; but such was not the case, for
                    while the dunged crop began to fade and stop growing, the bone turnip kept
                    growing vigorously. About the middle of October, when I considered both crops at
                    maturity, I had a comparative trial of their weight carefully made, the result
                    of which was six tons per acre in favour of the bones,—they being 28 tons per
                    acre of Aberdeenshire yellow turnip, and the farm-yard dung only 22 tons per
                    acre.</p>
                <p>“From this experiment, and the valuable information I had now obtained through my
                    friend Mr Healy of Lough-ton, in Lincolnshire, I was induced to extend the use
                    of bones on my farms, growing annually from 70 to 100 acres of turnips with this
                    manure, which gives me a great command of dung for my other crops. In 1823 I
                    erected machinery for grinding bones, my neighbours having now all be∞me
                    convinced of their great utility; and the first season I sold to the amount of
                    L.1500 worth. This last season, not less than L.10,000 has been paid for bones
                    used in this district of Strathmore, in the counties of Angus and Perth, a great
                    part of which was commissioned from Hull. There are now machines erected for
                    grinding bones in various parts of the country; so that the expense of inland
                    carriage is in many cases much lessened.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> The general practice is, to use bones on dry light
                    soils, where the turnip can be eat off the ground with sheep, in such proportion
                    (not less than one half) as may be reckoned necessary to manure the ground for
                    an aftercrop of oats or barley. The quantity of bone manure may be varied from
                    15 to 25 bushels of dust per acre, according to the state of the land. Some
                    difficulty was at first found in depositing the bones so that the plants might
                    reap all the benefit of it; but this is now obviated by the application of two
                    additional hoppers and spouts to the turnip sowing machine, which conduct the
                    manure and seed into the drill at the same time, and with the same expedition as
                    sowing the seed by the old machine. These barrows are made by most carpenters in
                    the country, and cost about L.8.</p>
                <p>“Doubts have been raised whether the succeeding crop of oats or barley is in any
                    degree benefited by the small quantity of bones used in growing a crop of
                    turnips. I can confidently state, that on my farms both the quantity and
                    quality, of my barley particularly, have been improved, and the grass for the
                    first year is a fortnight earlier in its growth than after other manures.</p>
                <p>“In the crop of 1825 the bone manure was a great blessing to the breeders and
                    feeders of cattle in this district, and in some instances saved the industrious
                    tenant from ruin. The severe drought even of that season did not prevent a crop
                    of turnips with bones, while all other manures failed; and it was thus the means
                    of bringing through that disastrous winter, herds of cattle which must have
                    otherwise perished for want of fodder.”</p>
                <p>Horn, says Sir H. Davy, is a still more powerful manure than bone, as it contains
                    a larger quantity of decomposable animal matter. The shavings or turnings of
                    horn, though they cannot be procured in great abundance, are much esteemed as a
                    manure, and have been long known to the farmers in the west of Scotland, who
                    sometimes bring them from Ireland. They are sown by the hand as a top-dressing
                    for wheat and other crops.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Burnt Clay.</hi></p>
                <p>This is a mode of preparation which was introduced into the west of Scotland some
                    years ago from Ireland, by Mr Craig at Cally, in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright.
                    That its effects have been beneficial in many cases cannot well be doubted, and
                    it is still in use by some very intelligent cultivators. But, as frequently
                    happens, it was recommended too warmly and in too unqualified a manner by its
                    earliest promoters; and experience in many instances not having confirmed their
                    statements, it has of late fallen into disrepute, and is now but little
                    employed. It will therefore be sufficient to refer to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Farmers Magazine,</hi> vol. xvi., where the practice is treated at some length
                    by those who first brought it into notice.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Articles.</hi></p>
                <p>We shall now mention some of those numerous vegetable, animal, and other
                    substances, which, though not in general use as manures, are sometimes employed
                    for that purpose, in particular situations.</p>
                <p>It had been long known that moss or peat, made up in compost with farm-yard dung,
                    affords a valuable manure; but it was first introduced to general notice by the
                    late Lord Meadowbank. The usual proportions may be about two-thirds of moss and
                    one-third of farm-yard dung, spread out in layers, one above another, in forming
                    the dung heap, but the bottom and top should be of moss. This heap in a few days
                    acquires a considerable degree of heat, indicating the progress of the process
                    of fermentation. It is then turned over, and made up again with or without a
                    further addition of moss and dung. When this compost has been properly managed,
                    the whole heap forms a homogeneous mass, moist, black, friable, and excellently
                    adapted to turnips, and all other crops that require rotted dung. No lime or
                    other calcareous matter should be admitted into the compost.</p>
                <p>The same object of increasing the quantity of manure may be obtained by carting
                    the moss to the farm-yard in which cattle are kept, where, without any further
                    trouble, it will become mixed up with their litter and dung, and be carted out
                    to the fields in one mass.</p>
                <p>Some very interesting and successful experiments have been made with oil mixed up
                    with farm-yard dung and moss, by Mr William Bell, on his estate in
                    Roxburghshire. We have entire confidence in the accuracy of this gentleman’s
                    statements, and present them in his own words in a recent communication to the
                    Highland Society of Scotland.</p>
                <p>“The object in view in the experiment now to be detailed, was to procure the
                    means of converting moss, or other decayed vegetable substance, into a rich
                    top-dressing, in a situation so far inland, that the expense of carriage from
                    the sea-coast (L.2. 5s. per ton) precluded the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193033761" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3761-0304"/>use, with any expectation of
                    profit, of blubber, bone, rapc-dust, or other similar substances. Attention had
                    been drawn to oil as a manure, by the practice of the Flemings, in forming their
                    liquid dung-pits, and by the fact that, in the use of blubber and rape-cake for
                    this purpose, the benefits following their application are in the precise
                    proportion of the inefficacy of the means employed for expressing the oil from
                    them. It was also conceived, that, to a certain extent at least, the nutritious
                    matter contained in bone-dust may be traced to the oleaginous particles of the
                    bony substance.</p>
                <p>“It was resolved to commence with one ton of oil, and such a proportion of moss
                    as, in all probability, that quantity of oil could easily convert by heating,
                    into a more profitable substance.</p>
                <p>“It was further resolved, that the process of heating should be aided by a
                    certain quantity of stable-dung, and that 250 cubic yards of moss to the ton of
                    oil should, in the first instance, be tried with 25 cubic yards of dung, though
                    it was expected that a much greater quantity of moss might be fully converted
                    into manure by that quantity of oil and dung.</p>
                <p>“A ton of “dreg,” or coarse whale-oil, therefore, costing L.16, was purchased at
                    Leith, and sent out at the cost of L.2. 10s. In the beginning of June 1825, a
                    bed was formed a foot thick of moss, which had been thrown out some time before,
                    but which still retained all its peaty qualities, and which, though still moist,
                    yet having lain in a heap for some months, was substantially freed of much of
                    its superfluous moisture.</p>
                <p>“Twenty-five cubic yards of good stable-dung were then laid in a thick layer upon
                    this bed; above which, another layer of moss was laid, fully a foot thick. On
                    this second layer of moss the whole quantity of oil was poured, and the residue
                    of the moss was laid above all, and along the sides, so as completely to cover
                    the whole well up.</p>
                <p>“In ten days the whole mass came freely into heat. It was turned after an
                    interval of about eight weeks, when it was found to have been greatly changed in
                    its texture and quality. After having been so treated, it heated freely again,
                    and, on inspection, was found to have been altogether altered. It had now all
                    the appearance of the richest possible black garden-mould, and was quite full of
                    large, fat earth-worms. It gave out a strong oily smell, from which it was
                    inferred that too little moss had been used; and some apprehension was
                    entertained as to its fitness for being applied to its primary destination,—a
                    top-dressing for grass-land.</p>

                    desirable to consume the substance which had been thrown out of the ditches, and
                    because the compound lay contiguous to the ground on which it was to be used,
                    while the cost of casting and turning was deemed equivalent to the carriage
                    afield of the manure that would have been required.</p>
                <p>260 cubic yards compound, at Is. 11∣d∙, about L.25 3 9</p>
                <p>“The farm-steward was of opinion that the produce was so rich as safely to admit
                    of its being used in equal quantities with ordinary farm-dung. Two several
                    portions of land, each of half an acre, were accordingly devoted to a trial of
                    its powers on that principle; tiic one, rich old turnip soil, worth 40s. of rent
                    per English acre; the other, new turnip land, which had never been broken up.
                    These portions were laid off in the centre of the two several fields, and the
                    manure was applied to the turnip' crop in the usual way. The other parts of both
                    fields were dunged with farm-yard manure,—equal quantities of it and of the
                    compound being given to the acre. The summer 1826 was not favourable to
                    turnip-crops generally; but it so happened that the crops on both these fields
                    were very, great.</p>
                <p>“On the old land, the turnips grown with the oil compound sprung earlier than on
                    the rest of the field, grew larger, and were more luxuriant, and very decidedly
                    kept the lead, both in root and shaw, during the whole season; but absence from
                    the spot prevented a minute register of weight and measure being kept.</p>
                <p>“On the new land, no difference could be distinguished betwixt the crop from the
                    two several manures: both were so good, that better could scarce have grown.</p>
                <p>“In the next crop (oats on both fields), though minutely inspected, no difference
                    in produce could be detected; but the same causes prevented the circumstances of
                    the case being duly attended to.</p>
                <p>“This year both fields are in grass, and both will be hayed. At present (30th
                    June) no difference can be detected.</p>
                <p>“No inconvenience from the oily smell was felt when the residue of the compost
                    was applied to grass-land. It was laid on early, and the ground was hayed. It
                    was given to the meadows last improved, and therefore the least advanced; while
                    rush-root compound, and other substances, were given to the older portions. The
                    crop on each was very great; but the preference was rather given to the oil.</p>
                <p>“These results were so far encouraging, that next year, 1826, two tons of oil
                    were purchased at the price of L.14 per ton, and used with rather less than 90
                    cubic yards of manure, and fully 900 of moss. About 550 cubic yards were used in
                    the first instance, in the same manner as on the former occasion, and the
                    residue of 350 thrown in when the compound was turned. It is now believed,
                    however, that it would have been better to have made up the whole at once, by
                    adding to the thickness of the several layers of moss, especially the centre
                    one.</p>

                    and freely the second, notwithstanding the error committed,—the result of which
                    was apparently to check the second fermentation a little, and to leave lumps
                    here and there not quite decomposed. But the whole has been substantially and
                    effectually changed, and confirms, in every respect, the result of the former

                <p>“The effect of these operations is probably twofold. In the first place, the oil,
                    thus divided, may be rendered a fit element for the nutrition of plants; and, in
                    the second place, unquestionably much benefit is secured by the <pb break="no"

                    substance of the peaty matter. Fully the larger share of benefit is ascribed to
                    this circumstance; but, at the same time, it is very probable that it may be
                    found by experiment that oil may with great advantage be used with every other
                    species of manure, or even with compounds of purely earthy ingredients.”</p>
                <p>Manure, in a liquid state, is used to a considerable extent in Flanders, where
                    the utmost attention is paid to the collecting of every substance that can serve
                    to enrich the soil. This consists of urine in which rape-cake has been
                    dissolved, the former being collected in subterraneous drains of brick-work,
                    from which it is raised by a temporary pump, and delivered into carts for being
                    carried to the field, where it is spread by means of hollow shovels or scoops.
                    This is the manure almost universally used for the flax crop, to which it is
                    applied at the rate of about 2500 gallons English beer measure the acre.</p>
                <p>Salt has been warmly recommended within these few years as a valuable manure, and
                    at the same time for its property in destroying weeds. The recent repeal of the
                    duties on salt has rendered this substance accessible to farmers in every part
                    of the country; and it has been subjected to a variety of experiments. These, as
                    might be expected, have not always given the same results; but the best attested
                    experiments do not seem to have been attended with such success as to justify
                    the encomiums that were at one time lavished upon this substance; and the
                    general impression among farmers is, that it is of little or no value whatever
                    as a manure. We are aware that a difference of opinion still exists on this
                    point; but such is the opinion we have come to, on what we conceive to be the
                    best authorities.</p>
                <p>Of the substances of vegetable or animal origin occasionally or locally applied
                    in this way, the number is very great. All <hi rend="italic">green succulent

                    laid out to ferment, in the manner already described. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The great quantity of valuable manure obtained from large towns is a mixture of
                    almost all these ingredients; and what was formerly a nuisance is now a source
                    of revenue to the inhabitants, and of fertility to the country around them.</p>
                <p>In several districts land is manured on the surface, by cattle and sheep confined
                    in temporary folds. See the chapter on <hi rend="smallcaps">Live Stock,</hi>
                    where the benefits of this practice will be inquired into. Its expediency is a
                    question that cannot be determined without a reference to its effects on the
                    animals themselves, as well as to the value of the manure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IX. <hi rend="smallcaps">Warping.</hi></p>
                <p>This is a mode of fertilizing lands, by depositing a coat of alluvial matter on
                    their surface, and is practised on the borders of large rivers and estuaries
                    into which the tides flow. It is said to have been first tried on the banks of
                    the Humber about a century ago, but was first brought into notice by Marshall in
                    1788, and afterwards by the <hi rend="italic">Report of the West Riding of
                    Yorkshire.</hi> A similar practice has been long known in Italy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033787" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3787-0306"/>
                <p>The waters of the tides that come up the Trent, the Ouse, the Don, and other
                    rivers which empty themselves into the great estuary of the Humber, are so
                    loaded with mud, that if a cylindrical glass twelve or fifteen inches long be
                    filled with them, there will presently be deposited an inch or sometimes more of
                    what is called warp. But where this matter comes from has been the subject of
                    dispute; for the water of the Humber at its mouth is clear, and in the very
                    driest seasons the warp is most plentiful. The improvement consists in
                    nothing,more than letting in the tide at high water, to deposit the warp, and
                    permitting it to run off again as the tide falls.</p>
                <p>The effect of this practice is to cover the surface with a new soil, which may be
                    raised in the course of one summer from 6 to 16 inches, so that it is immaterial
                    what may be the nature of the original soil; and the whole surface is left quite
                    level, whatever hollows there may have been before being now filled up.</p>
                <p>The operation begins usually in the month of July, and proceeds during the rest
                    of the summer season. The expense is said not to exceed L.12 or L.15 the acre;
                    and land has been known to rise in value by warping from L.5 to L.40 or L.50 per
                    acre. This new soil is so rich that it will carry very large crops for several
                    years afterwards without any manure; but it should be sown with clover, and left
                    in that state for two years, before it is opened for corn: it will then bear any
                    sort of crop suited to the quality of the soil. In this respect there is a
                    considerable difference even upon the same field, the warp in some places being
                    a strong loam, and in others light and friable. For a more particular
                    description of this process, the reader is referred to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agricultural Survey of the West Piding of Yorkshire.</hi></p>
                <p>The Italian practice referred to is thus described by an intelligent tourist
                    :—</p>
                <p>“In the Val di Chiana, fields that are too low are raised and fertilized by the
                    process called <hi rend="italic">Colmata,</hi> which is done in the following
                    manner. The field is surrounded by an embankment to confine the water. The dyke
                    of the rivulet is broken down so as to admit the muddy water of the high floods.
                    The Chiana itself is too powerful a body of water to be used for this purpose;
                    it is only the streams that flow into the Chiana that are used. This water is
                    allowed to settle and deposit its mud upon the field. The water is then let off
                    into the river at the lower end of the field, by a discharging course called <hi
                    rend="italic">scolo,</hi> and in French, <hi rend="italic">canal d'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">écoulement.</hi> The water-course which conducts the water from a
                    river, either to a field for irrigation or to a mill, is called <hi
                    rend="italic">gora.</hi> In this manner a field will be raised five and a half,
                    and sometimes seven and a half feet in ten years. If the dyke is broken down to
                    the bottom, the field will be raised the same height in seven years; but then in
                    this case gravel is also carried in along with the mud. In a field of 25 acres,
                    which had been six years under the process of <hi rend="italic">Colmata,</hi> in
                    which the dyke was broken down to within three feet of the bottom, the process
                    was seen to be so far advanced, that only another year was requisite for its
                    completion. The floods in this instance had been much charged with soil. The
                    water which comes off cultivated land completes the process sooner than that
                    which comes off hill and woodland. Almost the whole of the Val di Chiana has
                    been raised by the process of <hi rend="italic">Colmata”</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Though we propose to treat of the important subject of drainage in a separate
                    article, yet it seems proper here to notice such drains as are usually executed
                    by farmers themselves, without the assistance of a professional man. These may
                    be divided into such as are best suited to soils rather loose and incohesive,
                    and such as are best adapted to alluvial clays or soils of a uniform and close
                    texture.</p>
                <p>With regard to the first sort of drains, the practice is to cut them in such a
                    situation as to catch the spring before it oozes out of the subsoil and spreads
                    itself over the surface. In common language, the line of the drain commences
                    between the “wet and the dry,” and is of such a depth as may be necessary to get
                    down to the porous or sandy subsoil from which the spring emerges. In general
                    from two and a half feet to three and a half feet may be a sufficient depth; and
                    where the spring is not found at the latter depth, tapping or boring may be
                    resorted to. These drains are cut about the breadth of the spade at bottom, and
                    opened no wider at the surface than is necessary to give room to the labourer to
                    work, which may be usually from fifteen to eighteen inches. The best material
                    for filling them up with is small round stones, which are usually to be got from
                    the surface of the land itself; but a variety of other materials are
                    occasionally employed, such as furze, broom, and even straw, in situations where
                    stones cannot be readily procured. If there be reason to expect a constant
                    current of water in the bottom of the drain, some care must be taken in laying
                    the stones at the bottom, by forming a sort of arch, or by building up either
                    side a few inches, and laying flat stones as a coping above, leaving a clear
                    space for the stream below. But in most cases it is sufficient to select small
                    round stones for the bottom, which are thrown in promiscuously, the interstices,
                    as in the case of gravel, allowing the water to percolate freely through them.
                    When the drain has been filled up to within ten or twelve inches of the surface,
                    the stones are covered with turf or sod, the grassy side undermost, and then the
                    earth that had come out of the drain is thrown above until it comes to the level
                    of the surface. It is obvious, that to insure the free working of these drains,
                    they must never be disturbed by the plough, and therefore the covering of earth
                    should be always somewhat deeper than the plough works.</p>
                <p>On alluvial or clayey soils not infested with springs, the evil is necessarily
                    somewhat different, and requires a different remedy. Here the soil is of itself
                    tenacious of moisture, and does not allow the rain water to pass freely through
                    it. On such soils it may bethought that covered drains can be of little use; but
                    long experience has proved their efficacy, and the practice has within these few
                    years been introduced into Scotland from Essex and other parts of England. It is
                    thus described in a communication to the Highland Society of Scotland, and our
                    own observation can bear witness to the writer’s accuracy.</p>
                <p>“The work is performed by means of three spades of different sizes. The first may
                    be a common spade of moderate breadth, with which the surface-clay may be taken
                    off to the depth of eight or ten inches, or not quite so much if the clay be
                    very strong. The breadth of the drain at top may be from a foot to fifteen
                    inches, but it should never be less than a foot, as it is an advantage that the
                    sides should have a considerable slope,—and the two sides should slope as
                    equally as possible. Another workman follows the first, with a spade six inches
                    broad at the top, and becoming narrower towards the point, where it should not
                    exceed four inches. The length of the plate of this second spade should be
                    fourteen inches, and with it a foot or fourteen inches in depth can easily be
                    gained. A third workman, and he should be the most expert, succeeds the second,
                    and his spade should be four inches broad at the top, only two inches broad at
                    the point, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033800" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3800-0307"/>and
                    fourteen or fifteen inches in length. With this spade a good workman can take
                    out at least fifteen inches of clay. A sort of hoe or scoop, made of a plate of
                    iron formed nearly into the shape of a half-cylinder, of two inches diameter and
                    a foot or fourteen inches long, and fastened at an acute angle of perhaps 70° to
                    a long wooden handle, is now employed to scrape out the bottom of the drain, and
                    remove any small pieces of clay that may have fallen into it.</p>
                <p>“This completes the cutting of what is by the workmen called a three <hi
                    rend="italic">stamp</hi> drain. Where circumstances may render it necessary,
                    they may be made of four, five, or more <hi rend="italic">stamps.</hi> I would
                    in no case, unless perhaps where the land is to remain permanently in
                    sheep-pasture, and is free from moles, recommend their being made less than
                    three feet deep; and I am inclined to think, that where levels will admit of it,
                    it would almost always be more advantageous that the depth should be four feet.
                    Where the field is in summer fallow at the time, six inches of depth can
                    generally be gained by gathering the ridges pretty high, and taking as deep a
                    water-furrow as possible, with a wide-set plough. Three <hi rend="italic"
                    >stamps</hi> or spits taken from the bottom of this water-furrow will give a
                    depth of at least three feet and a half when the ridges are reduced to the
                    proper shape, which is easily done in the course of the subsequent ploughings.
                    In all cases I think it best to put a drain in every furrow, though some people
                    put only one in every second furrow.”</p>
                <p>In filling these drains, turf matted with the roots of coarse grasses is
                    considered the best material, though where this cannot be got, other articles,
                    such as wood, peat, clay, and even straw, have been found to answer. “The turfs
                    should be cut into an oblong shape, about four inches and a half broad (some
                    make them narrower a little at the grassy side than at the other, but this is
                    not very easily done, and I believe not very materiaD, and from three to five
                    inches thick. They are generally made about fourteen inches long. The grassy
                    side of the turf being turned undermost, they are put down into the drain, the
                    workman standing upon them after they are put in, and pressing them down with
                    his whole weight till they are firmly wedged between the sloping sides of the
                    drain. The ends of the turfs being cut somewhat obliquely, they overlap each
                    other a little; and by this means, although there is sufficient opening for the
                    surface-water to get down, nothing else can. The open space below the turf ought
                    to be about five or six inches in depth, three inches wide at top, and one and a
                    half or two inches at bottom. Some people prefer making the turf a little
                    broader, and by that means leaving a larger space below, from the idea that it
                    will be less likely to choke; but when the open space is much larger, the sides
                    of the drain below the turf are probably more apt to give way for want of
                    support.</p>
                <p>“The operation may now be completed by turning in as much earth, either with the
                    spade or the plough, as to fill up the drain to the proper level.”—“I must
                    remark, that the improvement has always appeared to me more striking in the
                    first two or three crops than afterwards; and the reason, I apprehend, is, that
                    although the drains remain perfectly clear, the clay above them becoming
                    gradually more compact, the surface-water does not get down into them so quickly
                    after a few years as it did at first.</p>
                <p>“The price I now pay for cutting wedge-drains three feet deep, including the
                    cutting of the turf and putting it in, is 4d. per rood of 20 lineal feet; and I
                    am at the expense of carrying the turf from the place where it is cut, and
                    laying it down close to the drains in a regular line, so that the person
                    employed by the contractor in putting it in can easily reach it without coming
                    out of the drain.</p>
                <p>“The expense of draining per acre must, it is obvious, depend on the breadth of
                    the ridges. Where these are of fifteen feet, the most common breadth in our
                    carses, it will cost about L.2. 17s. per acre; but in wedge-drained land, I
                    think the ridges may be advantageously made eighteen or twenty feet broad, which
                    will of course be attended with a proportionate reduction of the expense of
                    draining.” <hi rend="italic">(Prize Essays and Transactions of the Highland
                    Society of Scotland,</hi> vol. vi.)</p>
                <p>With respect to currents of water so considerable as not to admit of covered
                    drains, the drains must of course be left open; but in this case it may usually
                    be practicable to carry the water, by means of covered drains, into the
                    fence-ditches, instead of leaving them open in the middle of the field. It has
                    been already observed that a ditch forms a part of the fence, wherever the white
                    thorn or other live hedges are employed for that purpose.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II.</p>
                <p>OF LAND UNDER PERENNIAL HERBAGE, AND IN A STATE OF NATURE.</p>
                <p>There are few tracts of any extent throughout Great Britain, if we except the
                    shifting sands on some parts of the coast, that do not bear plants of one kind
                    or other; and having treated, in the preceding chapter, of crops raised by the
                    labours of agriculture, it remains to consider those parts of our territory
                    which nature has clothed with plants, the spontaneous products of soil and
                    climate, and to mention the purposes to which these tracts are applied, and the
                    improvements of which they are susceptible.</p>
                <p>In the earlier stages of society, the <hi rend="italic">cerealia</hi> used for
                    the food of man necessarily obtain the principal attention of the cultivator.
                    Little or no labour is required to provide food for the few animals whose
                    assistance he needs in his rude operations; and herds and flocks, which
                    propagate around him without his care, find the means of subsistence in those
                    extensive wilds on which his feeble exertions have not yet materially
                    encroached. Though he is chiefly indebted to these animals, at this period, both
                    for his food and clothing, agriculture must have made considerable progress
                    before he attempts to supply their occasional wants by improving their pastures
                    or cultivating plants expressly for their maintenance. Until the middle of the
                    seventeenth century, neither roots nor herbage were cultivated for live stock in
                    England, nor in Scotland till about a hundred years after. The only provision
                    for their subsistence, during the long winters of our latitude, was natural
                    herbage in the state of hay, commonly the produce of some marshy or humid soils,
                    along with the straw of corn; and during summer, the natural pastures, too
                    generally occupied in common, were thought to require and to admit of little or
                    no improvement.</p>
                <p>It is not till the increase of population, and the extension of tillage to supply
                    its wants, that, in consequence of successive encroachments on the range of the
                    inferior animals, it becomes necessary at last to allot a part of the cultivated
                    land itself for raising their food. In most countries of Europe it is not found
                    profitable, even at this day, to cultivate herbage and roots to any extent for
                    feeding cattle; and the same course of successive crops of corn, with which the
                    earliest agriculturists everywhere began their labours, still prevails almost
                    universally in the north of Europe; not because all the land is required for
                    producing grain, but, on the contrary, because the demand of the population for
                    grain is so limited, compared with the extent of the country, as to leave the
                    far greater part in the possession of the inferior animals, which in this case
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033813" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3813-0308"/> can be
                    brought to market at a much lower price than would replace the charges of
                    feeding them on crops raised by means of aration.</p>
                <p>Other causes than the scantiness of population have produced a similar effect,
                    though in a much smaller degree, in Great Britain; and by far the larger part of
                    our territory also is still appropriated to the maintenance of live stock. A
                    great portion of it, indeed, is incapable of being cultivated with any
                    advantage; but meadows, pastures, and wastes, are spread over extensive tracts,
                    that would yield cultivated crops in abundance, both for man and the inferior
                    animals. Before concluding this article, we shall have occasion to notice what
                    seem to be the causes of this state of things; but it is unquestionable that, in
                    the present circumstances of the country, a great deal of tire most fertile land
                    is employed more profitably for its owners and occupiers, under perennial
                    herbage, than it could be under our most approved courses of tillage. In what
                    respect the interest of the nation is concerned in this arrangement, this is not
                    the place to inquire.</p>
                <p>To give a concise view of the agricultural state of the land in Britain not
                    subjected to aration, we shall offer some observations on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meadows,</hi> on <hi rend="italic">Natural Pastures,</hi> and on <hi
                    rend="italic">Wastes,</hi> in separate sections.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Meadows.</hi></p>
                <p>By <hi rend="italic">meadows,</hi> we understand all such land as is kept under
                    grass chiefly for the sake of a hay crop, though occasionally, and at particular
                    seasons of the year, it may be depastured by the domesticated animals; and we
                    usually include under this term the notion of a greater degree of moisture in
                    the soil, than would be thought desirable either for permanent pasture or lands
                    in tillage. Where hay is in great demand, as near large towns, and especially if
                    a good system of cropping be but little understood, a great deal of arable land,
                    indeed, may be seen appropriated to hay crops; but the most valuable meadows are
                    such as are either naturally rather moist, or rendered so by means of
                    irrigation.</p>
                <p>As the alternate and convertible systems of husbandry, before explained, prevail
                    throughout all the lowlands of Scotland, there is little land that deserves the
                    name of meadow; though it is sometimes applied to marshy spots, not worth
                    improving for tillage, which yield a quantity of coarse herbage to be made into
                    hay, and are called <hi rend="italic">bog</hi> meadows. The only natural hay
                    grounds of much value in Scotland are to be found in the sheep-walks of the
                    southern counties, where one or two small inclosures near the farmer’s or
                    shepherd’s dwelling-house are commonly reserved for producing hay to feed the
                    flocks during a deep snow; and as there is seldom much land in tillage in such
                    places, the manure made from a few horses and cows is sometimes spread on the
                    surface of these fields, though by no means according to any regular plan. To a
                    very small extent, watered meadows have been tried in Scotland; but, from a
                    general conviction of the superior advantages of cultivating herbage and roots
                    on all soils that can be made to produce them, and probably also owing to the
                    less fertilizing qualities of the waters, even meadows of this kind are not
                    likely ever to become of general importance there. The remarks which we mean to
                    offer on this subject must therefore be understood as applicable to the practice
                    of England only.</p>
                <p>The indigenous plants of which meadow-grass consists necessarily vary with the
                    qualities of the soil. The most valuable are, the sweet-smelling vernal-grass
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anthoxanthunι</hi><hi rend="italic">odoratum)</hi>; perennial
                    ryegrass <hi rend="italic">(Lolium perenne)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> foxtail
                    <hi rend="italic">(Alopecurus</hi><hi rend="italic">pratensis)</hi> common
                    meadow-grass <hi rend="italic">{Poa</hi><hi rend="italic">trivialis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Poa</hi><hi rend="italic">pratensis)</hi>; and soft meadow-grass
                    <hi rend="italic">(Holcus lanatus).</hi> The <hi rend="italic">poas</hi> compose
                    the greater part of the celebrated Orcheston meadows near Salisbury, and of the
                    no less productive meadows near Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>The period at which stock is excluded from meadows, in order that the grasses may
                    rise for a hay crop, is different, according to the nature of the soil in regard
                    to humidity, and the kind of stock with which the land is depastured. In some
                    instances the cattle are removed in November, while the sheep are continued on
                    the ground till February. <hi rend="italic">(Middlesex Report,</hi> p. 224.) In
                    other places the meadows are open to all kinds of stock from August to April <hi
                    rend="italic">(Id.</hi> p. 219), and to sheep even till May. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Lincolnshire Report,</hi> p. 196.)</p>
                <p>In the judicious management of meadow lands, attention must be paid to prevent
                    the stagnation of water and the growth of aquatic plants, and to extirpate fem,
                    docks, thistles, and other weeds. Moss, in particular, often establishes itself
                    on such lands, to the great injury of the valuable grasses, and can with
                    difficulty be removed, even by the application of calcareous manures. Ant and
                    molehills also abound in meadows, and are too often so much neglected as to
                    render a large portion of the surface nearly unproductive. And in these, as in
                    all other hay grounds, the preparatory operations for the scythe should always
                    conclude with the use of a heavy roller.</p>
                <p>The most important particulars in the management of meadow lands are, their
                    improvement by irrigation, and by the application of manure. Of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Irrigation</hi> we shall treat in a separate article.</p>
                <p>With regard to the time at which manure should be applied, a great difference of
                    opinion prevails among the farmers in England. In the county of Middlesex, where
                    almost all the grass-lands are preserved for hay, the manure is invariably laid
                    on in October <hi rend="italic">(Middlesex Report,</hi> p. 224), while the land
                    is sufficiently dry to bear the driving of loaded carts without injury, and when
                    the heat of the day is so moderated as not to exhale the volatile parts of the
                    dung. Others prefer applying it immediately after the hay-time, from about the
                    middle of July to the end of August, which is said to be the “good old time
                    ;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    and if that season be inconvenient, any time from the beginning of February to

                    too common a practice to carry out the manure during frosty weather, when,

                    are dissipated and washed away by the snow and rains before they can penetrate
                    the soil.</p>
                <p>“There is scarcely any sort of manure that will not be useful when laid on the
                    surface of grass-lands; but in general those of the more rich dung kinds will be
                    the most suitable for the older sorts of sward-land, and dung in composition
                    with fresh vegetable earthy substances the more useful in the new lays or
                    grass-lands.”—“In this district it is the practice of the best farmers to prefer
                    the richest dung they can procure, and seldom to mix it with any sort of earthy
                    material, as they find it to answer the best in regard to the quantity of
                    produce, which is the principal object in view; the cultivators depending
                    chiefly on the sale of their hay in the London markets.”—“It is the practice to
                    turn over the dung that is brought from London in a tolerable state of
                    rottenness, once chopping it well down in the operation, so as to be in a

                    of fineness when put upon the land. It is necessary, however, that it should be
                    in a more rotten and reduced state when applied in the spring, than when the
                    autumn is chosen for that purpose.” (Dickson’s <hi rend="italic">Practical
                    Agriculture,</hi> vol. ii. p. 915.)</p>
                <p>Some very interesting experiments have been made with different kinds of manure,
                    for the purpose of ascertaining their effects,both in regard to the quantity and
                    quality of the produce on different kinds of land. Fourteen lots, of half an
                    acre of eight yards to the rod each, were thus manured, and the grass was made
                    into hay, all as nearly alike as possible. The greatest weight of hay was taken
                    from the lot manured with horse, cow, and butchers’ dung, all mixed together, of
                    each about an equal quantity. It lay in that state about two months, and was
                    then turned over and allowed to lie eight or ten days more, after which it was
                    put on the land before it had done fermenting, and spread immediately. And to
                    ascertain the quality of the produce of the different lots, a small handful from
                    each was laid down on a dry, clean place, where there was little or no grass,
                    and six horses were turned out to them, one after another. In selecting the
                    lots, there seems to have been little difference of taste among die horses; and
                    all of them agreed in rejecting two lots, one of which had been manured with
                    blubber mixed with soil, and the other with soot,—in both instances laid on in
                    the month of April preceding. <hi rend="italic">{Lancashire Report,</hi>]). 130,

                <p>“The proportion of manure that is necessary must in a great measure depend upon
                    the circumstances of the land, and the facility of procuring it. In this
                    district (near London), where the manure is of a very good and enriching
                    quality, from its being produced in stables and other places where animals are
                    highly fed, the quantity is usually from four or five to six or seven loads on
                    the acre, such as are drawn by three or four horses in their return from town on
                    taking up the hay.” (Dickson’s <hi rend="italic">Practical Agriculture,</hi>
                    vol. ii. p. 916.)</p>
                <p>Manure is laid on at intervals of time, more or less distant, according to the
                    same circumstances that determine the quantity of it. Though there are some
                    instances of hay-grounds bearing fair crops every year during a length of years
                    without any manure, or any advantage from pasturage, except what the after-grass
                    has afforded,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Marshall’s

                    or fourth year, or the land depastured one year and mown the other; “or, what is
                    better, depastured two years and mown the third.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Northumberland Report,</hi> p. 111.) A succession of hay crops, without manure
                    or pasturage, on meadows not irrigated, is justly condemned by all judicious
                    farmers, as a sure means of impoverishing the soil.</p>
                <p>The mode of converting this herbage into hay, being somewhat different from that
                    which has been described in regard to clovers and ryegrass, requires to be
                    mentioned here. The farmers of Middlesex, who supply the metropolis with hay,
                    are understood to manage this department of rural economy in a very perfect
                    manner; and a particular account of their practice is given in the Report by
                    Middleton, to which we refer.</p>
                <p>“In the course of hay-making,” says this writer, “the grass should, as much as
                    possible, be protected both day and night against rain and dew, by cocking. Care
                    should also be taken to proportion the number of hay-makers to that of the
                    mowers, so that there may not be more grass in hand at any time than can be
                    managed according to the described process. This proportion is about twenty
                    hay-makers (of which number twelve may be women) to four mowers: the latter are
                    sometimes taken half a day to assist the former. But in hot, windy, or very
                    drying weather, a greater proportion of hay-makers will be required than when
                    the weather is cloudy and cool.</p>
                <p>“It is particularly necessary to guard against spreading more hay than the number
                    of hands can get into cock the same day, or before rain. In showery and
                    uncertain weather the grass may sometimes be suffered to lie three, four, or
                    even five days in swath. But before it has lain long enough for the under side
                    of the swath to become yellow (which if suffered to lie long would be the case),
                    particular care should be taken to turn the swaths with the heads of the rakes.
                    In this state it will cure so much in about two days as only to require being
                    tedded a few hours, when the weather is fine, previous to its being put together
                    and carried. In this manner hay may be made and stacked at a small expense and
                    of a good colour, but the tops and bottoms of the grass are insufficiently
                    separated by it.</p>
                <p>“There are no hay-stacks more neatly formed, or better secured, than those of
                    Middlesex. At every vacant time, while the stack is carrying up, the men are
                    employed in pulling it with their hands into a proper shape; and about a week
                    after it is finished, the whole of it is properly thatched, and then secured
                    from receiving any damage from the wind, by means of a straw-rope extended along
                    the eaves, up the ends, and near the ridge. The ends of the thatch are
                    afterwards cut evenly below the eves of the stack, just of sufficient length for
                    the rainwater to drip quite clear of the hay. When the stack happens to be
                    placed in a situation which may be suspected of being too damp in the winter, a
                    trench of about six or eight inches deep is dug round, and nearly close to it,
                    which serves to convey all the water from the spot, and renders it perfectly dry
                    and secure.” <hi rend="italic">{Middlesex Report,</hi> p. 238-241.)</p>
                <p>When the grass has risen again after the hay crop, it is usually depastured, as
                    has been already mentioned when treating of clovers: to mow a second time is
                    considered a bad practice among the best hay farmers. <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Middlesex Report,</hi> p. 249.) But it is the usage of some to leave the
                    after-grass on the ground without being eaten till spring, when it is said to be
                    preferable, for ewes and lambs, to turnips, cabbages, or any other species
                    whatever of what is termed <hi rend="italic">spring-feed.</hi> This mode of
                    management, which is strongly recommended by Mr Young, and in some cases by Mr
                    Marshall also, is unknown in the north, where, though it is in many cases found
                    beneficial, with a view to an early spring growth, not to eat the pastures too
                    close before winter, it would be attended with a much greater loss of herbage
                    than any advantage in spring could compensate, to leave the after-growth of mown
                    grounds untouched till that season. There has never been found any deficiency of
                    milk with ewes that are tolerably well supplied with turnips a little before and
                    after they drop their lambs.</p>
                <p>The weight of the hay produced on meadows well managed, being on an average about
                    one ton and a half per acre, holds out little encouragement to retain good
                    arable land in this condition; and, unless near London and a few other large
                    towns, pasturage would probably give a much more valuable return. In
                    Lincolnshire, where there are some of the richest grazing lands in England, it
                    is observed that all lands that will feed cattle should be mown as little as
                    possible; and nothing pays worse there than the <pb break="no"

                    labour as a crop of corn, and more than in many counties, and is not of half the
                    value.” <hi rend="italic">^Lincolnshire Report,</hi> p. 195.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Pastures.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already mentioned, in the preceding chapter, that pasturage for one, two,
                    or more years, is frequently interposed in the course of cropping arable land,
                    to prevent that exhaustion of the soil which is commonly the consequence of
                    incessant tillage crops. The pasture lands to be treated of here are, therefore,
                    such as are retained permanently, or at least for an indefinite period, in this
                    state, merely for the sake of the herbage they yield, and without any particular
                    view to the amelioration of the lands for bearing crops of grain. In this
                    general application of the word, permanent pastures include not only such land
                    as might be cultivated by the plough, but also all those uplands to which
                    tillage operations could not be extended with any prospect of remuneration, such
                    as the far greater part of the hilly and mountainous sheep grounds throughout
                    this kingdom. The nature of these pastures is, however, so different, and the
                    expediency of retaining <hi rend="italic">arable land</hi> in permanent pasture
                    has been so keenly discussed, that it will be proper to notice the two
                    descriptions separately, under the general though not quite accurate
                    appellations of <hi rend="italic">feeding</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hilly</hi>
                    pastures. Under the former we may comprehend all old rich pastures that are
                    capable of <hi rend="italic">fattening</hi> cattle; and under the second, such
                    as are adapted to <hi rend="italic">rearing</hi> them only, or are more
                    advantageously depastured by sheep.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Feeding-Pastures.</hi></p>
                <p>Of these there is a great extent in most of the counties of England, but very few
                    in Scotland, except near the houses of great proprietors; and much useless
                    controversy has been carried on between the farmers of the two countries, about
                    the comparative advantages of preserving such pastures, or of bringing them
                    under a regular system of alternate or convertible husbandry. That much of this
                    land in the south would be more productive, both to the proprietor and occupier,
                    under a good course of cropping than under pasture, it is impossible to deny;
                    but it is no less certain, that there are large tracts of rich grazing land,
                    which, in the present state of the demand for the produce of grass-lands, and of
                    the law of England with regard to tithes, cannot be employed more profitably for
                    the parties concerned than in pasture. The interest which the Board of
                    Agriculture has taken in this question, with a view to an abundant supply of
                    corn for the wants of a rapidly increasing population, seems, therefore, not to
                    have been well directed. Instead of devoting a large portion of their volumes to
                    the instruction of farmers regarding the best method of bringing grass-lands
                    into tillage, and restoring them again to meadow or pasture without
                    deterioration, the first thing required was to attempt removing the almost
                    insuperable obstruction of tithes, by proposing to the legislature an equitable
                    plan of commutation. If some beneficial arrangement were adopted on this head,
                    there is no reason to doubt that individual interest would soon operate the
                    wished-for change; and that all grass-lands capable of yielding more rent and
                    profit under tillage than under pasture would be subjected to the plough as fast
                    as the demands of the population might require.</p>
                <p>Except in regard to those necessary operations that have been already noticed
                    under the former section,— such as the extirpation of weeds and noxious shrubs,
                    clearing away ant and mole-hills, &amp;c—there are few points respecting the
                    management of this kind of land, on which some difference of opinion does not
                    prevail. The time of stocking,—the number of the animals, and whether they
                    should be all of one or of different species,—the extent of the inclosures,—and
                    the propriety of eating the herbage close, or leaving it always in a rather
                    abundant state,—are all of them questions which it is· scarcely possible to
                    decide in a satisfactory manner by the application of general rules. They can
                    only be resolved, with any pretensions to utility, by a reference to the
                    particular circumstances of each case; for the practice of one district, in
                    regard to these and other points, will be found quite inapplicable to others,
                    where the soil and climate, and the purposes to which the pastures are applied,
                    are materially different.</p>
                <p>It has been recommended to apply manure to grasslands, even where, not being used
                    as hay grounds, they afford no means of supply. (Dickson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Practical Agriculture,</hi> vol. ii. p. 953.) But, excepting the dung dropped
                    by the pasturing animals, which should always be regularly spread from time to
                    time, it may be laid down as a rule of pretty extensive application, that if
                    grass-lands do not preserve their fertility under pasturage, it would be much
                    better to bring them under tillage for a time, than to enrich them at the
                    expense of land-carrying crops of corn.</p>
                <p>Another practice, which is scarcely less objectionable, is that of stacking on
                    the field, or carrying to be consumed there during winter the provender that
                    ought to have furnished disposable manure for the use of the farm at large. It
                    is to no purpose that such a wasteful practice is defended, on dry light soils,
                    which are alleged to be thus benefited by the treading of the cattle.
                    (Marshall’s <hi rend="italic">Fural Economy of Yorkshire,</hi> vol. ii. p. 131.)
                    During the frequent and heavy falls of rain and snow in winter, there is
                    scarcely any land so dry as not to be injured by the treading of heavy cattle;
                    and were there any thing gained in this respect by this management, it would be
                    much more than counterbalanced by the loss of a great part of the manure from
                    the same cause. The able writer to whom we have just referred very properly
                    disapproves of carting on manure in winter; and for the same reason,—namely, the
                    loss of it which must necessarily be the consequence,—he ought to have objected
                    to foddering on the land, or <hi rend="italic">teathing,</hi> at that season.
                    The practice, however, is but too common in those districts, both in South and
                    North Britain, where the knowledge of correct husbandry has made but little
                    progress. It is equally objectionable, whether the fodder be consumed on meadows
                    where it grew, or on other grass-lands. The fodder should in almost every
                    instance be eaten in houses or fold-yards, instead of the dung being dropped
                    irregularly over the surface, or, as must be almost always the case, accumulated
                    in some spots sheltered by trees and hedges, to which the animals necessarily
                    resort during the storms of winter.</p>
                <p>The time of opening pastures in spring must evidently be earlier or later,
                    according to the climate, and in the same climate according to the season; and
                    the state of: growth which it is desirable that the grass should attain before
                    being stocked, must in some degree be determined by the condition and
                    description of the animals to be employed in consuming it,—whether they are only
                    in a growing state, or approaching to fatness,—whether milch cows or sheep, or a
                    mixture of animals of different species. It conveys no very precise idea
                    respecting these points, though the remark itself is just, to say that the
                    herbage should not be allowed to rise so high as to permit the coarser plants to
                    run to seed, and that it is bad management to suffer <hi rend="italic">store
                    stock</hi> to be turned upon a full bite.</p>

                <p>(Marshall’s <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire,</hi> vol. ii. p. 129.) The great objects
                    to be aimed at are, that the stock, of whatever animals it may consist, should
                    be carried forward, faster or slower, according to tire purposes of their owner;
                    and that no part of the herbage should be allowed to run to waste, or be
                    unprofitably consumed. But nothing but careful inspection of the land and of the
                    stock, from time to time, can enable any grazier to judge with certainty what
                    are the best measures for attaining these objects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Fatting cattle?</hi> says Mr Marshall,
                    “which are forward in flesh, and are intended to be finished with grass, may
                    require a full bite at first turning out. But for <hi rend="italic">cows,

                    intended to be fatted on grass, a full bite at the first turning out is not
                    requisite.”—“Old Ladyday to the middle of April, according to the progress of
                    spring, appears to me at present as the best time for <hi rend="italic">shutting

                    <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire,</hi> vol. ii. p. 152-3.)</p>
                <p>In regard to the state of the growth of pastures when first stocked, some
                    distinction should be made between new leys and old close swards. To prevent the
                    destruction of the young plants, whether of clovers or other herbage, on die
                    former description of pasture, which would be the consequence of stocking them
                    too early, especially with sheep, they should be allowed to rise higher than
                    would be necessary in the case of old turf; and to secure their roots from the
                    further injury of a hot summer, it is advisable not to feed them close in the
                    early part of the season, and probably not at any time throughout the whole of
                    the first or second season, if the land is to be continued in pasture. The roots
                    of old and firm sward, on the other hand, are not in so much danger, either from
                    close feeding or from die heats of summer; and they are in much less danger from
                    the frosts and thaws of winter.</p>
                <p>Another circumstance almost equally indeterminate with the time of opening
                    pastures, is the stock which should be employed, and whether they should be all
                    of one or of different kinds.</p>
                <p>With regard to the former, all soils rather moist, and of such a quality, as is
                    the case with rich clays, as to produce herbage suited to the fattening of
                    cattle, will in general be more advantageously stocked with them than with
                    sheep; but there can be no other rule for the total exclusion of sheep than the
                    danger of the rot, nor any other general rule for preferring one kind of stock
                    to another than their comparative profits.</p>
                <p>With regard to a mixed stock, the sentiments and practice of the best graziers
                    seem to be in its favour. “It is generally understood that <hi rend="italic"
                    >horses</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cattle</hi> intermixed will eat grass cleaner
                    than either species will alone, not so much from their separately affecting
                    different grasses, as from die circumstance of both species disliking to feed
                    near their own dung.” (Marshall’s <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    154.) “Some few graziers follow the old custom of keeping only one kind of stock
                    upon the same ground, whilst others, we think with more propriety, intermix with
                    oxen and cows a few sheep and two or three colts in each pasture, which both
                    turn to good account and do little injury to the grazing cattle. In some cases
                    sheep are a real benefit, by eating down and destroying the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ragwort</hi><hi rend="italic">(Senecio</hi><hi rend="italic">jacobaea),</hi>
                    which disgraces some of the best pastures of the county, where <hi rend="italic"
                    >oxen only</hi> are grazed.” <hi rend="italic">(Northumberland, Report,</hi> p.
                    126.) And in Lincolnshire, where grazing is followed to a great extent, and with
                    uncommon success, as well as in most other districts, the practice seems to be,
                    almost invariably, to keep a mixed stock of sheep and catee on the same pasture
                    <hi rend="italic">(Lincolnshire</hi> j‰- <hi rend="italic">ρort,</hi> p. 174),
                    in proportions varying with the nature of the soil and the quality of the
                    herbage.</p>
                <p>It is obviously impossible to estimate the number of animals that may be
                    depastured on any given extent of ground, without reference to the particular
                    spot in question; and the same difference exists, with regard to the propriety
                    of feeding close or leaving the pastures rough, that prevails in most other
                    parts of this subject. Though there be loss in stocking too sparingly, the more
                    common and dangerous error is in overstocking, by which the summer’s grass is
                    not unfrequently entirely lost. There seems to us, however, to be a season, some
                    time during the year, when grass-lands, particularly old turf, should be eaten
                    very close, not merely for the sake of preventing waste, but also for die
                    purpose of keeping down the coarser kinds of plants, and giving to the pastures
                    as equal and fine a sward as possible. The most proper period must partly depend
                    upon the convenience of the grazier; but it can hardly be either immediately
                    before the drought of summer or the frost of winter. Some time in autumn, when
                    the ardent heat of die season is over, and when there is still time for a new
                    growth before winter, may be most suitable for the land itself, and generally
                    also for the grazier, his fat stock being then mostly disposed of, or carried to
                    the after-grass of mown grounds. The <hi rend="italic">sweeping</hi> of pastures
                    with the scythe may be employed as a substitute for this close feeding; the
                    waste and labour of which, however, though they be but trifling, it does not
                    seem necessary to incur on rich grazing lands under correct management.</p>
                <p>The size of inclosures is a matter of considerable importance on grass-lands,
                    both for the stock itself, and the mode of consuming the produce. In general,
                    pastures best adapted to sheep should be in large fields. The animals are not
                    only impatient of heat, and liable to be much injured by flies, in small
                    pastures often surrounded by trees and high hedges, but they are naturally, with
                    the exception perhaps of the Leicester variety, much more restless and easily
                    disturbed than the other species of live stock. “Sheep,” says a well-known
                    writer, “love a wider range, and ought to have it, because they delight in short
                    grass: give them eighty or ninety acres, and any fence will keep them in;
                    confine them to a field of seven or eight acres, and it must be a very strong
                    fence that keeps them in.” (Kames’s <hi rend="italic">Gentleman Farmer,</hi> p.
                    203.) Though fields so large as 80 or 90 acres can be advisable only in hilly
                    districts, yet the general rule is nevertheless consistent with experience in
                    regard to all our least domesticated varieties.</p>
                <p>The size of fields deserves attention on another account; for there are strong
                    reasons for preferring pasture land in two or more inclosures, to the same
                    extent in one large field. Besides the advantages of shelter, both to the
                    animals and the herbage, such subdivisions enable the grazier either to separate
                    his stock into small parcels, by which means they feed more at their case, or to
                    give the best pastures to that portion of them which he wishes to come earliest
                    to market. The advantages of moderate sized inclosures are well known in the
                    best grazing counties; but the subdivisions are in some instances much more
                    minute than is consistent with the value of the ground occupied with fences, or
                    necessary to the improvement of the stock.</p>
                <p>“In all cases,” says Marshall, “where fatting cattle or dairy cows make a part of
                    the stock, and where situation, soil, and water will permit, every suite of
                    grazing grounds ought, in my idea, to consist of <hi rend="italic">three
                    compartments</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> one for <hi rend="italic">head</hi>
                    stock (as cows or fatting cattle), one for <hi rend="italic">followers</hi> (as
                    rearing or other lean stock), and the third to be shut up to freshen, for the
                    <hi rend="italic">leading</hi> stock.” (Marshall’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yorkshire,</hi> vol. ii. p. 158∙) <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033865"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3865-0312"/>It is sufficiently obvious that every inclosure of
                    pasture land should be provided with abundance of water at all times, though
                    this is in some districts a matter of considerable difficulty. Mr Marshall has
                    given a full account of the method of forming drinking pools in Yorkshire, but
                    our limits oblige us to refer the reader to his work.</p>
                <p>A practice has been introduced into Norfolk within these few years, the object of
                    which is to obtain a rich turf, with all the valuable qualities of old pasture,
                    much sooner than from seeds alone. This is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >transplanting turf,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inoculating land with grass.</hi>
                    A field of good old grass-land is stripped of part of its turf, which is cut
                    into pieces of about three inches square, and placed in its new situation, about
                    six inches apart, on land previously prepared to receive it. In this way one
                    acre of turf will plant nine acres; but it is only a part of the old pasture
                    that is taken off, and this is done in such a manner as not materially to injure
                    it. After being thus planted, the roots are pressed down by means of heavy
                    rollers, which cause them to spread along the ground instead of rising up in
                    tufts; and in a summer or two, during which this transplanted pasture should be
                    very lightly if at all fed upon, the grasses shed their seeds and fill up the
                    interstices, the whole being then formed into a compact and uniform turf.
                    (Blaikie <hi rend="italic">on the Conversion of Arable Land into Pasture.')</hi>
                    Later writers, particularly Sinclair, the author of <hi rend="italic">Hortus
                    Gramineus</hi><hi rend="italic">Woburnensis,</hi> think this practice has
                    excited notice only by its novelty, and that it never can become of extensive
                    utility.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Hilly Pastures.</hi></p>
                <p>These include such low hills as produce fine short herbage, and are with much
                    advantage kept constantly in pasture, though they are not altogether inaccesible
                    to the plough; as well as such tracts as, from their acclivity and elevation,
                    must necessarily be exclusively appropriated to live stock. The former
                    description of grass-lands, though different from the feeding pastures, of which
                    we have just treated, in respect of their being less convenient for tillage
                    management, are nevertheless in other circumstances so nearly similar as not to
                    require any separate discussion. These low hills are for the most part occupied
                    with sheep, a very few cattle being sometimes depastured towards their bases;
                    and they frequently comprise herbage sufficiently rich for fattening sheep,
                    together with coarser pastures for breeding and rearing them. In many instances,
                    a small part of such tracts is cultivated chiefly for providing green crops for
                    the sheep in winter; but corn is quite a subordinate object, and extensive
                    aration is seldom attempted, except for the purpose of laying down the land to
                    grass in an improved condition.</p>
                <p>The more elevated pastures, from which the plough is altogether excluded, have
                    been commonly classed among waste lands,—even such of them as bear herbage by no
                    means of inconsiderable value,—as well as heaths and moors, with patches of
                    which the green pastures are often chequered. The general term <hi rend="italic"
                    >wastes</hi> is therefore a very indefinite expression, and indeed is not
                    unfrequently made to comprehend all that extensive division of our territory
                    that neither produces corn nor rich herbage. Yet it is on such tracts that by
                    far the greater part of our butcher-meat and wool is grown, and not a little of
                    the former fully prepared for the market. Foreigners and superficial readers at
                    home must accordingly be greatly mistaken if they imagine that what are called
                    <hi rend="italic">wastes</hi> by the Board of Agriculture, and other' writers on
                    rural economy, are really altogether unproductive; and it would be a still
                    grosser error to believe that these wastes owe their continuance to neglect or
                    mismanagement, and that any exertions of human industry can ever render the
                    greater part of them, including all the mountainous tracts of Great Britain,
                    more valuable than they are at present, without a much greater expenditure of
                    capital than, under almost any circumstances, they could possibly return. Yet as
                    this vague general term has been established by use, we shall bring together, in
                    the following section, a few observations on the present condition of that part
                    of our territory which is still almost in a state of nature, and the
                    improvements of which it is susceptible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wastes.</hi></p>
                <p>That part of Britain which is still in a state of waste might be treated of under
                    a number of heads, corresponding to the various causes of its infertility. Land
                    is comparatively unproductive, owing, Is/, to the surface being covered with
                    stones, or occupied with worthless shrubs and other plants; 2<hi rend="italic"
                    >dly,</hi> to the superabundance of water, as in the case of mosses and marshes;
                    3<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> to an original defect in the soil, as in loose
                    sands, moors, and compact sterile clays, sometimes called <hi rend="italic"
                    >till;</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">thly,</hi> to the elevation and ruggedness of the
                    surface, and the ungenial character of the climate, as in our mountainous
                    districts; 5<hi rend="italic">thly,</hi> to the previous exhaustion of the
                    vegetable matter of the soil by injudicious cropping; and, 6<hi rend="italic"
                    >thly,</hi> to the mode of tenure and occupancy, as in commons.</p>
                <p>It is matter of regret that the subject of wastes has not yet been treated in
                    that distinct and scientific manner which its importance deserves. It would be
                    advisable to have it ascertained what portion of these divisions, or of others
                    under which our wastes may be arranged, is capable of improvement, and how far
                    such improvement is eligible, on a fair estimate of the cost, and the probable
                    increase of produce. It should also be considered, as far as precision is
                    attainable on such points, how much farther a proprietor might advantageously
                    proceed in the expenditure of capital, than one who is merely a temporary
                    occupier. For it is evident that an improvement will be sufficiently profitable
                    to the former if he draws for his outlay 4 or 5 per cent, yearly; whereas a
                    tenant, holding on a lease of 20 years, must have an annuity for that period of
                    at least three times the amount, in order that his capital may be returned, with
                    the ordinary profits of trade, before its expiration.</p>
                <p>The delusive prospects of profit from the improvement of wastes, held out by
                    speculative men, have an unhappy tendency to produce disappointment in rash and
                    sanguine adventurers, and ultimately to discourage such attempts as, with
                    judicious attention to economy, would in all probability be attended with great
                    success. Those who are conversant with the publications that have lately
                    appeared on this subject, must be aware with what caution the alleged results of
                    most of these writers ought to be examined, and how different has been the
                    experience of those who have ventured to put their schemes in practice, from
                    what they had been led to anticipate.</p>
                <p>There are few soils, however, so unfertile, and few tracts of any extent so
                    destitute of soil, as not to be susceptible of profitable improvement, if the
                    climate be not altogether hostile to vegetation, or the surface so steep or so
                    rugged as not to admit of any other operations than such as must be executed by
                    manual labour. With this exception, and the exception probably of what is called

                    paring and burning as a preparation for tillage; by trenching, irrigation, and
                    embankment.</p>
                <p>We shall offer a few remarks on this subject, in the order first above
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>1. When the surface of ground is much covered with stones, it is material to
                    consider not only the expense which will attend the clearing of it, but whether
                    the soil and climate be such as to remunerate the cultivator after it has been
                    brought into a state of tillage, and to what purpose the stones themselves may
                    be applied. When the stones that project from the surface are a part of the rock
                    continued beneath the soil, it may be doubted whether, instead of incurring the
                    expense of working away the rock to such a depth as would allow the plough to
                    pass over it, it may not be advisable to let the land remain in pasture, and
                    improve it by top-dressings.</p>
                <p>Very large blocks of stone are cleared away by means of gunpowder; but if this is
                    not necessary, they are raised by levers, and rolled upon a sledge, or by the
                    use of a block and tackle attached to a triangle. In the latter case, a hole is
                    bored into the stone, and an iron bolt with an eye driven into it; and this,
                    though apparently incapable of bearing any great weight, serves to raise the
                    stone in a perpendicular direction, until it can be deposited upon a cart or
                    sledge placed below it, to be carried off the field.</p>
                <p>As soon as the stones are removed, the holes must of course be filled up, and the
                    surface rendered tolerably level. The best method of doing this is by trenching,
                    which answers the further purpose of deepening the soil, and removing any
                    remaining obstacle within the reach of the plough.</p>
                <p>“The greater part of the land in the vicinity of Aberdeen,” says the author of
                    the Report of that county, “has, from the most barren and unproductive state,
                    been thoroughly improved by <hi rend="italic">trenching.</hi> Not less than 3000
                    acres have been trenched within three miles of Aberdeen; and in all places of
                    the county considerable additions have been made to the arable, by trenching the
                    barren lands.”</p>
                <p>“It is practised in barren land, which abounds in stones of different dimensions,
                    sometimes, where the soil is dry, and in other cases, where it is wet, united
                    with draining: it is practised when the object is to deepen the soil, or to mix
                    a portion of the subsoil along with it: it is practised when the subsoil is
                    tilly or very tenacious, as well as when that next the surface is unproductive,
                    moory, or exhausted by overcropping: and, lastly, it is practised when the land
                    is foul, and when stronger or cleaner soil can be brought up to the surface.</p>
                <p>“The expense indeed could not have been borne in many cases, if the first crop
                    (for so it may be called, as it covered the whole soiD that was raised by the
                    spade and mattock had not produced from L.30 to L.50 per acre. This was a crop
                    of granite stones, which was sold for paving the streets of London. But, after
                    all, the ground that was thus gained to the community would not have been able
                    to recompense the cultivator, if a mixture of the spade and plough husbandry had
                    not been introduced. The rent of the land in the immediate vicinity of Aberdeen
                    is extremely <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> high, being now, on a lease for
                    years, from L.5 to L.10 per acre, and in a few cases not less than L.18; nay,
                    when let for a single crop, sometimes as high as L.20. Yet all this is necessary
                    to remunerate the improver, who trenched, dunged, limed, and cultivated this
                    thin soil, which must be frequently manured. It would have yielded too little
                    produce, if tilled only by the plough; and would have been cultivated at too
                    great an expense, if the soil had been constantly digged by the spade. A medium
                    between these two, viz. either the alternate use of the plough and spade, or at
                    least a mixture of plough and spade husbandry, was thus introduced by necessity,
                    and has been attended with the happiest effects.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aberdeenshire Report.')</hi></p>
                <p>2. In the case of mosses and marshes, the first thing is to get rid of the
                    superabundance of water, by opening a main drain, into which such smaller ones
                    as may be necessary will discharge themselves. On the subject of improving moss
                    land a great deal has been written within these few years, and many experiments
                    made with very different results. In favourable circumstances, if the operation
                    is carefully and economically conducted, there can be no doubt that land of this
                    description may be improved with ultimate benefit to the undertaker. But the
                    great object ought to be, not (at least for some years at first) to convert the
                    land into tillage, but merely to render it productive in the state of meadow or
                    pasture. With this view, the first operation after draining should be to get rid
                    of the heath and coarse herbage on the surface, by burning, levelling it where
                    necessary at the same time, and then to top-dress with calcareous matter, either
                    by itself or mixed up in compost with earth and other substances, as a
                    preparation for grass-seeds. If it be necessary to turn over the whole surface,
                    this in many cases may be done as cheaply by the spade as by the plough, and to
                    much better purpose. Timothy <hi rend="italic">(phleum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pratense)</hi> will be found one of the most valuable grasses on such a soil;
                    but if the surface be sufficiently saturated with calcareous matter, and not too
                    wet, clovers, particularly white clover, and the grasses usually sown upon
                    arable land, may be used with advantage. The after-management must of course
                    depend upon circumstances. Frequent rolling must always be of use in compressing
                    a soil which is naturally spongy; thus preventing the’ roots of the plants from
                    being thrown out of the ground: and we should think that in general it must be
                    better to retain such land for some years in the state of meadow, top-dressing
                    it occasionally, than even in pasturage.</p>
                <p>Among the various attempts that have been made upon a large scale to reclaim moss
                    land, we shall mention two that seem worthy of particular notice.</p>
                <p>The first cannot be considered as an improvement of the mossy soil itself. On the
                    contrary, the improvement consists in getting rid of it altogether. The practice
                    may be shortly described as follows :—</p>
                <p>“A stream of water is carried first upon the spongy upper stratum of moss, which
                    is by this means conveyed away to the neighbouring frith or arm of the sea, the
                    light moss being thrown into a ditch, made as the temporary bed of this
                    artificial rivulet. The upper part, or spongy moss, is thus carried off by
                    successive ditches, to the extent of 30 or 40 yards broad; then a second deeper
                    ditch is cut into the clay or bottom of the flat stratum of the heavy moss, and
                    a number of parallel ditches are made for admitting the rivulet, into which the
                    remaining moss is thrown, till nearly the whole is carried off, excepting a thin
                    stratum, consisting partly of black peat-earth, and partly of decayed wood found
                    in the moss, which is burnt for manure to the carse soil about to be cultivated.
                    Much ingenuity has been shown in constructing machinery to supply water for
                    removing the moss, previous to the improvement of the carse or rich soil below.
                    For some years after being thus cleared both of peat-moss and the remains of
                    wood, successive crops of oats were formerly too often repeated; but this was
                    found to be injurious, and a more regular mode of cropping is now
                    introduced.</p>
                <p>“In 1766, the late Lord Kames became proprietor of the estate of Blair-Drummond,
                    in the county of Perth, where he resolved to carry on with spirit this mode of
                    improvement on the moss of Kincardine. After trying <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193033891" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3891-0314"/>several experiments, he at
                    last adopted the plan of giving profitable leases to small occupiers of land, to
                    induce them to remove the moss; and before his death in 1782, no less a number
                    than 336 acres were cleared of moss, and brought into cultivation. His son and
                    successor pursuing the same plan, got 440 acres more let in three years, to
                    which additions were made periodically. In 1792 the population had increased to
                    764 souls, who cultivated 444 acres. By a survey in 1805, 577 acres were
                    cleared, including 12 acres occupied by roads. In 1814 considerably above 800
                    acres were cleared, and the population amounted to upwards of 900 souls.</p>
                <p>“Thus an extensive tract of country, where formerly only a few snipes and
                    muirfowl could find subsistence, has been converted, as if by magic, into a rich
                    and fertile carse of alluvial soil, worth from L.3 to L.5 per acre.”</p>
                <p>The other instance is that of the improvement of Chat moss in the county of
                    Lancaster, by Mr Roscoe of Liverpool. The length of this moss is about six
                    miles, its greatest breadth about three miles, and its depth may be estimated at
                    from 10 to upwards of 30 feet. It is entirely composed of the substance well
                    known by the name of peat, being an aggregate of vegetable matter, disorganized
                    and inert, but preserved by certain causes from putrefaction. On the surface it
                    is light and fibrous, but becomes more dense below. On cutting to a considerable
                    depth, it is found to be black, compact, and heavy, and in many respects
                    resembling coal. There is not throughout the whole moss the least intermixture
                    of sand, gravel, or other material, the entire substance being a pure
                    vegetable.</p>
                <p>It is now upwards of 20 years since Mr Roscoe, in company with Mr Wakefield,
                    began to improve Trafford moss, a tract of 300 acres, lying two miles east of
                    Chat moss; and his operations on it seem to have been so successful as to
                    encourage him to proceed with Chat moss. But in the improvement of the latter,
                    he found it unnecessary to incur so heavy an expense for drainage. From
                    observing that, where the moss had been dug for peat, the water had drawn
                    towards it from a distance of 50 to 100 yards, he conceived that if each drain
                    had to draw the water only 25 yards, they would, within a reasonable time,
                    undoubtedly answer the purpose. The whole of the moss was therefore laid out on
                    the following plan.</p>
                <p>“I first carried a main road,” says Mr Roscoe, in a recent communication to the
                    Board of Agriculture, “nearly from east to west, through the whole extent of my
                    portion of the moss. This road is about three miles long and 36 feet wide. It is
                    bounded on each side by a main drain, seven feet wide and six feet deep, from
                    which the water is conveyed, by a considerable fall, to the river. From these
                    two main drains other drains diverge, at 50 yards distance from each other, and
                    extend from each side of the road to the utmost limits of the moss. Thus each
                    field contains 50 yards in front to the road, and is of an indefinite length,
                    according as the boundary of the moss varies. These field-drains are four feet
                    wide at the top, one foot at the bottom, and four feet and a half deep. They are
                    kept carefully open, and, as far as my experience hitherto goes, I believe they
                    will sufficiently drain the moss, without having recourse to under draining,
                    which I have never made use of at Chat moss, except in a very few instances,
                    where, from the lowness of the surface, the water could not readily be gotten
                    off without open channels, which might obstruct the plough.”</p>
                <p>The cultivation of the moss then proceeds in the following manner. “After setting
                    fire to the heath and herbage on the moss, and burning it down as far as
                    practicable, I plough a thin sod or furrow with a very sharp horse-plough, which
                    I burn in small heaps, and dissipate; considering it of little use but to
                    destroy the tough sods of the <hi rend="italic">Eriophora,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nardus stricta.,</hi> and other plants, whose matted roots are almost
                    imperishable. The moss being thus brought to a tolerably dry and level surface,
                    I then plough it in a regular furrow six inches deep; and as soon as possible
                    after it is thus turned up, I set upon it the necessary quantity of marl, not
                    less than 200 cubic yards to the acre. As the marl begins to crumble and fall
                    with the sun or frost, it is spread over the land with considerable exactness;
                    after which I put in a crop as early as possible, sometimes by the plough, and
                    at others with the horse-scuffle or scarifier, according to the nature of the
                    crop; adding, for the first crop, a quantity of manure, which I bring dow n the
                    navigable river Irwell to the borders of the moss, setting on about 20 tons to
                    the acre. Moss land thus treated may not only be advantageously cropped <hi
                    rend="italic">the first year</hi> with green crops, as potatoes, turnips,
                    &amp;c. but with any kind of grain; and as wheat has of late paid better to the
                    farmer than any other, I have hitherto chiefly relied upon it, as my first crop,
                    for reimbursing the expense.”</p>
                <p>The expense of the several ploughings, with the burning, sowing, and harrowing,
                    and of the marl and manure, but exclusive of the seed, and also of the previous
                    drainage and general charges, amounts to L.18. 5s. per acre; and in 1812, on one
                    piece of land thus improved, Mr Roscoe had 20 bushels of wheat, then worth a
                    guinea per bushel, and on another piece 18 bushels; but these were the best
                    crops upon the moss.</p>
                <p>“Both lime and marl arc generally to be found within a reasonable distance; and
                    the preference given to either of them will much depend upon the facility of
                    obtaining it. The quantity of lime necessary for the purpose is so small in
                    proportion to that of marl, that, where the distance is great, and the carriage
                    high, it is more advisable to make use of it; but where marl is upon the spot,
                    or can be obtained in sufficient quantity at a reasonable expense, it appears to
                    be preferable.” Mr Roscoe is thoroughly convinced, after a great many different
                    trials, that all temporizing expedients are fallacious; and that “the best
                    method of improving moss land is <hi rend="italic">by the application of a
                    calcareous substance, in a sufficient quantity to convert the moss into a soil,
                    and by the occasional use of animal or other extraneous manures,</hi> such as
                    the course of cultivation and the nature of the crops may be found to
                    require."</p>
                <p>There seems to be little more that is peculiar to himself in Mr Roscoe’s
                    operations and course of cropping, except his contrivance for setting on the
                    marl. It would not be practicable, he observes, to effect the marling at so
                    cheap a rate (L.10 per acre), were it not for the assistance of an iron road or
                    railway laid upon boards or sleepers, and movable at pleasure. Along this road
                    the marl is conveyed in waggons with small iron wheels, each drawn by one man.
                    These waggons, by taking out a pin, turn their lading out on either side: they
                    carry about 15 cwts. each, being as much as could heretofore be conveyed over
                    the moss by a cart with a driver and two horses.</p>
                <p>In the month of November 1805, Mr Roscoe began the drainage by cutting out the
                    main drains on each side of the road, throwing out the moss from the drains into
                    the middle of the road. In 1807 the smaller drains, at 50 yards distance from
                    each other, were begun, and about 1000 acres laid out in the manner already
                    mentioned. In 1808 part of the moss was sufficiently consolidated to be worked
                    with horses in pattens: this year a farm-house, with out-buildings, cottages,
                    &amp;c. was erected, and marl was set upon the land prepared for that purpose.
                    About 20 acres were cropped with turnips and potatoes in 1809; and in the year
                    following, upwards of 80 acres, of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033904"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3904-0315"/>which 20 were wheat. In 1811 Mr Roscoe had 100
                    acres in crop, chiefly in wheat; and in 1812 marl and street manure were applied
                    in the quantities specified above. The crops were wheat and beans, which much
                    surpassed those of any preceding year. “In the course of the present year (1813)
                    I shall have brought into cultivation about 160 acres, which will be cropped
                    with wheat, oats, potatoes, and beans. A tract of 30 acres of clover appears to
                    be very promising.”</p>
                <p>The depreciation of agricultural produce in 1815, and the difficulty of combining
                    a regular course of cropping with the bringing in of additional waste land,
                    induced Mr Roscoe to laydown the whole of the improved part of Chat moss into
                    meadow land. So long as land of this description continues productive in the
                    state of meadow or pasture, it does not appear advisable to attempt any course
                    of cropping whatever; and to lay it down for either of these purposes ought
                    perhaps to form the chief inducement to its improvement.</p>
                <p>3. A third cause of sterility is found in the natural texture of the soil, as in
                    loose sands and coarse impermeable clays. Moving or blowing sands occur on the
                    sea-coast of many parts of Scotland, and are not only worthless themselves, but
                    frequently inflict serious injury on the lands within their reach, over which
                    the sand spreads itself. This is a matter to which the Highland Society of
                    Scotland have very properly turned their attention; and we shall extract from
                    their communications some account of an attempt that has been recently made to
                    fix these sands, and to render them in some measure productive. The experiment
                    to which we allude was made in 1819 and 1820, on a farm in the parish of Harris,
                    and county of Inverness, by the proprietor, Alexander N. Macleod, Esq., “who has
                    completely succeeded in reclaiming and bringing into useful permanent pasture
                    above 100 Scotch acres of useless blowing sand, by planting in it sea-bent <hi
                    rend="italic">(Arundo arenaria),</hi> known in the Hebrides by the name of
                    bent-grass, and sowing rape-seed on it in a small proportion. The rape-seed
                    requiring to be covered with sea-weed or some other manure immediately after
                    sowing, is not considered so beneficial as the grass, as this requires no
                    manure, or any other cultivation or top-dressing whatever, after being properly
                    planted.</p>
                <p>“The operations commenced upon the above farm in the month of September 1819, by
                    cutting the Arundo arenaria or bent-grass about two inches below the surface,
                    with a small thin-edged spade with a short handle, which a man can use in his
                    right hand, at the same time taking hold of the grass in his left; other persons
                    carrying it to the blowing sand, to be planted in a hole, or rather a cut made
                    in the sand, about eight or nine inches deep (and deeper where the sand is very
                    open and much exposed), by a large narrow-pointed spade. A handful of Arundo
                    arenaria or bent-grass was put into each of these cuts, which were about twelve
                    inches distant, more or less according to the exposure of the situation. When
                    properly fixed in the blowing sand, the roots begin to grow, and spread under
                    the surface, in the course of a month after planting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> When Mr Macleod commenced the operations in
                    reclaiming the tract of ground alluded to, it was altogether covered with
                    blowing sand in winter and spring, and nearly so in summer. A great part of it
                    consisted of high banks of sand, which did not produce grass or verdure of any
                    kind whatever.</p>
                <p>“The Arundo arenaria or bent-grass is relished by cattle in summer, but it is of
                    greater value by preserving it on the ground for wintering cattle. It would be
                    injudicious to cut it, because it will stand the winter better than any other
                    grass, and is seldom covered with snow. Neither wind, rain, nor frost will
                    destroy it; but the old grass naturally decays towards the latter end of spring
                    and the beginning of summer, as the new crop grows.</p>
                <p>“White and red clover will grow spontaneously among this grass in the course of a
                    few years, provided it is well secured. It will produce seed in some instances
                    within twelve months after planting; but the seed does not, on high exposed
                    situations, come to the maturity that seed requires for sowing. On this account,
                    to propagate this grass from the root is considered preferable to sowing.</p>
                <p>“The Arundo arenaria or bent-grass operations should not commence in any season
                    earlier than about the 20th October, and should be given up about the beginning
                    of March, as this planting thrives much better in the wet season.”</p>
                <p>The other descriptions of soil, which owing to their texture are of little value
                    in their natural state, are close, compact clays, imbedded with small stones,
                    and incumbent upon subsoils which do not allow the water to escape. Such land is
                    in general covered with stunted heath and other coarse plants, and to the other
                    causes of its infertility is often added a bad climate. The object in this case,
                    as in the former, should generally be to obtain better herbage, rather than to
                    convert it into arable land.</p>
                <p>One of the most common and effectual practices in improving this description of
                    land is <hi rend="italic">paring</hi> and <hi rend="italic">burning; a</hi>
                    practice which, in the case of old swards matted with the roots of coarse
                    herbage and heath, is acknowledged, both by scientific and practical writers, to
                    be highly advantageous as the next step to be taken after drainage. “The process
                    of burning,” says Sir Humphry Davy, “renders the soil less compact, less
                    tenacious and retentive of moisture; and, properly applied, may convert a matter
                    that was stiff, damp, and in consequence cold, into one powdery, dry, and warm,
                    and much more proper as a bed for vegetable life.</p>
                <p>“The great objection made by speculative chemists to paring and burning is, that
                    it destroys vegetable and animal matter, or the manure in the soil; but in cases
                    in which the texture of its earthy ingredients is permanently improved, there is
                    more than a compensation for this temporary disadvantage. And in some soils,
                    where there is an excess of inert vegetable matter, the destruction of it must
                    be beneficial; and the carbonaceous matter remaining in the ashes may be more
                    useful to the crop than the vegetable fibre from which it was produced.</p>
                <p>“Many obscure causes have been referred to for the purpose of explaining the
                    effects of paring and burning; but I believe they may be referred entirely to
                    the diminution of the coherence and tenacity of clays, and to the destruction of
                    inert and useless vegetable matter, and its conversion into a manure.</p>
                <p>“All soils that contain too much dead vegetable fibre, and which consequently
                    lose from one-third to one-half of their weight by incineration, and all such as
                    contain their earthy constituents in an impalpable state of division, <hi
                    rend="italic">i. e.</hi> the stiff clays and marls, are improved by burning; but
                    in coarse sands, or rich soils containing a just mixture of the earths, and in
                    all cases in which the texture is already sufficiently loose, or the organizable
                    matter sufficiently soluble, the process of torréfaction cannot be useful.</p>
                <p>“All poor silicious sands must be injured by it; and practice is found to accord
                    with theory. Mr Young, in his Essay on manures, states, ‘ that he found burning
                    injure sand and the operation is never performed by good agriculturists upon
                    silicious sandy soils, after they have once been brought into cultivation.” <hi

                    facs="nls:193033917" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3917-0316"/>Some eminent cultivators,
                    however, prefer using the plough at the very first. They begin with a wide,
                    shallow furrow, laying over the surface as flat as possible; and in that state
                    it remains to rot for fifteen or eighteen months. It is then cross-ploughed,
                    usually about midsummer, and well harrowed; dressed with lime, ridged up, and
                    sown with rye or oats the following spring. As soon as the crop is removed, it
                    is ploughed for turnips, to which dung is applied; and the turnips being eaten
                    on the ground by sheep, it is laid to grass the year after, the seeds being sown
                    along with oats or barley.</p>
                <p>This mode of management, however, can only be adopted on lands of rather a loose
                    texture, suited to turnip. On more compact soils, we should think paring and
                    burning, followed by top-dressings of lime and compost, a preferable practice.
                    But if it be thought expedient to turn over the turf or sod with the plough, a
                    great number of ploughings and harrowings must be required to destroy the roots
                    and pulverize the soil sufficiently; and two summers at least will be necessary
                    to complete the operation. When it is thus brought into a state to be sown with
                    grass-seeds, lime should be freely applied after the last ploughing, and well
                    harrowed in; and then the grass-seeds soxvn with or without a corn crop.
                    Wherever the object is pasture, a comparatively small quantity of lime will
                    produce the desired effect, if it be kept on the surface instead of being turned
                    down by the plough. It is unnecessary to mention, that on soils of this
                    description, tenacious of moisture, open trenches will be necessary, to prevent
                    any water from stagnating, the furrows also being made so deep as to draw off
                    and discharge any excess of moisture in the soil itself. This kind of land is
                    evidently better suited to pasturage than to meadow, and the pasture may be kept
                    from deterioration by repeated top-dressings.</p>
                <p>4. Much of our mountainous districts is necessarily left in a comparatively
                    unproductive state, from the elevation and ruggedness of the surface, and
                    ungenial character of the climate; but such tracts present so great a variety in
                    their circumstances, that it would be idle to attempt laying down any rules of
                    general application. The leading improvement, we conceive, must be in carrying
                    off the surface-water in open drains, and providing shelter by means of
                    plantations.</p>
                <p>5. A soil not naturally unproductive has in many cases been rendered sterile, at
                    least for a time, by injudicious management. When lime and other calcareous
                    manures were first applied to fresh soils, the corn crops produced were often so
                    valuable as to lead to their repetition year after year, without the
                    intervention of ameliorating crops or the application of manures. We have known
                    three successive crops of wheat taken from the same land, and of corn altogether
                    not .less than ten crops in as many years. Under this management the soil could
                    not fail to be reduced to a state of barrenness and waste, of which there are
                    still too many instances in many parts of Scotland. The appropriate remedy here
                    is the use of enriching manures, and after a time lime or other calcareous
                    matters may be added. Such land has not only been robbed of its nutritive
                    powers, but the very texture of the soil itself has experienced an unfavourable
                    change. A few years’ pasturage must always be useful on land that has undergone
                    so severe a course of tillage.</p>
                <p>6. Much of the commons and common lands throughout the country may be considered
                    as retained in a state of comparative waste, by reason of their tenure and mode
                    of occupancy. In Scotland there is now very little land in this state, the law
                    affording a ready means of dividing it, with a few exceptions, among the
                    proprietors or occupants, according to their respective rights and interests. It
                    is otherwise, however, in England, where a special act of parliament seems to be
                    necessary in almost every instance; and though much has been done there in the
                    way of allocating and improving such land under the authority of inclosure acts,
                    much still remains to be done. But the improvement of such land is not so much
                    an agricultural as a political question. When once it is brought into the state
                    of private property, the methods to be adopted for rendering it more productive
                    will necessarily depend upon the nature of the soil and other circumstances.</p>

                <p>In the observations which we have to offer on this grand department of husbandry,
                    which in some quarters of the island enjoys a decided preference over tillage,
                    we shall treat, 1. Of Horses; 2. Of Cattle; 3. Of Sheep; 4. Of Swine; and, 5. Of

                <p>The form of a horse peculiarly adapted to the labours of agriculture, has been
                    well described by a writer of great experience, in the following words:—.</p>
                <p>“His head should be as small as the proportion of the animal will admit; his
                    nostrils expanded, and muzzle fine; his eyes cheerful and prominent; his ears
                    small, upright, and placed near together; his neck, rising out from between his
                    shoulders with an easy tapering curve, must join gracefully to the head; his
                    shoulders, being well thrown back, must also go into his neck (at what is called
                    the points) unperceived, which, perhaps, facilitates the going much more than
                    the narrow shoulder; the arm or fore thigh should be muscular, and, tapering
                    from the shoulder, meet with a fine, straight, sinewy, bony leg; the hoof
                    circular, and wide at the heel; his chest deep, and full at the girth; his loin
                    or fillets broad and straight, and body round; his hips or hooks by no means
                    wide, but quarters long, and tail set on so as to be nearly in the same right
                    line as his back; his thighs strong and muscular; his legs clean and fine-boned;
                    his leg-bones not round, but what is called lathy or flat.” (Culley <hi

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Breeds.</hi></p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">black cart-horse,</hi> bred in the midland counties of
                    England (see Plate XH.), is better suited for drays and waggons than for the
                    common operations of a farm. The present system of farming requires horses of
                    more mettle and activity, better adapted for travelling, and more capable of
                    enduring fatigue, than those heavy, sluggish animals. This variety is understood
                    to have been formed, or at least brought to its present state, by means of
                    stallions and mares imported from the Low Countries; though there appears to be
                    some difference in the accounts that have been preserved, in regard to the
                    places whence they were brought, and the persons who introduced them.<note

                    “The breed of grey rats,” says Mr Marshall, “with which this island has of late
                    years been overrun, is nota greater pest in it than the breed of black fen
                    horses; at least while cattle remain scarce, as they are at present, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193033930" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3930-0317"/> while the flesh
                    of horses continues to be rejected as an article of human food.” (Marshall’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Yorkshire,</hi> vol. ii. p. 164.) The present improved subvariety
                    of this breed is said to have taken its rise in six Zealand mares, sent over
                    from the Hague by Lord Chesterfield, during his embassy at that court.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Cleveland bays,</hi> which owe some of their most
                    valuable properties to crosses with the race-horse, have been long celebrated as
                    one of the best breeds in the island; but they are said to have degenerated of
                    late. They are reared to a great extent in Yorkshire, the farmers of which
                    county are remarkable for their knowledge in every thing that relates to this
                    species of live, stock. In activity and hardiness these horses have perhaps no
                    superior. Some capital hunters have been produced by putting full-bred stallions
                    to mares of this sort; but the chief object latterly has been to breed
                    coach-horses, and such as have sufficient strength for a two-horse plough. Three
                    of these horses carry a ton and a half of coals, travelling sixty miles in
                    twenty-four hours, without any other rest than two or three baits upon the road;
                    and they frequently perform this labour four times a week.</p>
                <p>3. A third variety is the <hi rend="italic">Suffolk Punch,</hi> a very useful
                    animal for rural labour. Their merit seems to consist more in constitutional
                    hardiness than true shape. See Plate XII. “Their colour is mostly yellowish or
                    sorrel, with a white ratch or blaze on their faces; the head large, ears wide,
                    muzzle coarse, fore-end low, back long, but very straight, sides flat, shoulders
                    too far forward, hind quarters middling, but rather high about the hips, legs
                    round and short in the pasterns, deep-bellied, and full in die flank; here,
                    perhaps, lies much of the merit of these horses; for we know, from observation
                    and experience, that all deep-bellied horses carry their food long, and
                    consequently are enabled to stand longer and harder days’ works. However,
                    certain it is that these horses do perform surprising days’ works. It is well
                    known that the Suffolk and Norfolk farmers plough more land in a day than any
                    other people in the island; and these are the kind of horses everywhere used in
                    those districts.” ( Culley on <hi rend="italic">Lire Stock,</hi> p. 27.)</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Clydesdale</hi> horse has been long in high repute in
                    Scotland and the north of England, and, for the purposes of the farmer, is
                    probably equal to any other breed in Britain. Of the origin of this race various
                    accounts have been given, but none of them so clear or so well authenticated as
                    to merit any notice. They have got this name, not because they are bred only in
                    Clydesdale or Lanarkshire,—for the same description of horses are reared in the
                    other western counties of Scotland, and over all that tract which lies between
                    the Clyde and the Forth,— but because the principal markets at which they are
                    sold, Lanark, Carnwath, Rutherglen, and Glasgow, are situated in that district,
                    where they are also preserved in a state of greater purity than in most other
                    parts. They are rather larger than the Suffolk Punches, and the neck is somewhat
                    longer; their colour is black, brown, or grey, and a white spot on the face is
                    esteemed a mark of beauty. The breast is broad; shoulder thick, the blades
                    nearly as high as the chine, and not so much thrown backwards as in road-horses;
                    the hoof round, usually of a black colour, and the heels wide; the back straight
                    and broad, but not too long; the bucks visible, but not prominent, and the space
                    between them and the ribs short; the tail heavy, and well haired, the thighs
                    meeting each other so near as to leave only a small groove for the tail to rest
                    on. One most valuable, property of this breed is, that they are remarkably true
                    pullers, a restive horse being rarely found among them. See Plate XIII.</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">Welsh</hi> horse bears a near resemblance, in point of
                    size and hardiness, to the best of the native breed of the Highlands of
                    Scotland, and other hilly countries in the north of Europe. It is too small for
                    the present two-horse ploughs, but few horses are equal to them for enduring
                    fatigue on the road. “I well remember one,” says Mr Culley, “that I rode for
                    many years, which, to the last, would have gone upon a pavement by choice, in
                    preference to a softer road.” <hi rend="italic">( Observations on Live
                    Stock,</hi> p. 35.)</p>
                <p>6. A little horse, of much the same size with the former, or rather larger,
                    called a <hi rend="italic">Galloway,</hi> from its being found chiefly in that
                    province of Scotland, has now become very rare; the breed having been neglected,
                    from its unfitness for the present labours of agriculture. The true Galloways
                    are said to resemble the Spanish horses; and there is a tradition, that some of
                    the latter, that had escaped from one of the vessels of the Armada, wrecked on
                    the coast of Galloway, were allowed to intermix with the native race. Such of
                    this breed as have been preserved in any degree of purity are of a light bay or
                    brown colour, with blacklegs, and are easily distinguished by the smallness of
                    their head and neck, and the cleanness of their bone.</p>
                <p>7. The still smaller horses of the Highlands and Isles of Scotland are
                    distinguished from larger breeds by the several appellations of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ponies, Shelties,</hi> and, in Gaelic, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Garrons</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gearrons.</hi> They are reared in great
                    numbers in the Hebrides, or Western Isles, where they are found in the greatest
                    purity. Different varieties of the same race are spread over all the Highland
                    district and the Northern Isles. This ancient breed is supposed to have been
                    introduced into Scotland from Scandinavia, when the Norwegians and Danes first
                    obtained a footing in these parts. “It is precisely the same breed that subsists
                    at present in Norway, the Feroe Isles, and Iceland, and is totally distinct from
                    every thing of horse kind on the continent of Europe south of the Baltic. In
                    confirmation of this, there is one peculiar variety of the horse in the
                    Highlands that deserves to be noticed. It is there called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >eel-backed</hi> horse. (See Plate XIII.) He is of different colours, light bay,
                    dun, and sometimes cream-coloured; but has always a blackish list that runs
                    along the ridge of the back, from the shoulder to the rump, which has a
                    resemblance to an eel stretched out. This very singular character subsists also
                    in many of the horses of Norway, and is nowhere else known.” (Walker’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Hebrides,</hi> vol. ii. p. 158.)</p>
                <p>“The Highland horse is sometimes only nine, and seldom twelve hands high,
                    excepting in some of the southern of the Hebrides, where the size has been
                    raised to thirteen or fourteen hands by selection and better feeding. The best
                    of this breed are handsomely shaped, have small legs, large manes, little neat
                    heads, and are extremely active and hardy. The common colours are grey, bay, and
                    black; the last is the favourite one.” <hi rend="italic">( General Report of
                    Scotland,</hi> vol. iii. p. 176.) ,</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Ereeding and Hearing.</hi></p>
                <p>The same attention to select the best males and females for breeding, which has
                    been productive of the most advantageous rosults in the case of cattle and
                    sheep, does not prevail very generally in the breeding of farm-horses: on the
                    contrary, though every one exercises some degree of judgment in regard to the
                    stallion, there are few breeders, comparatively,,who hesitate to employ very
                    ill-formed and worthless mares,—and often solely because they are unfit for any
                    thing else than bringing a foal. All the best writers on Agriculture reprobate
                    this absurd and unprofitable practice. “In the midland counties of England the
                    breeding of <hi rend="italic">cart-horses</hi> is attended to with the same
                    assiduity<pb break="no" facs="nls:193033943" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3943-0318"/> as
                    that which has of late years been bestowed on cattle and sheep, while the
                    breeding of <hi rend="italic">saddle-horses, hunters,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >coach-horses,</hi> is almost entirely neglected; is left almost wholly to
                    chance, even in <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> I mean
                    as to females. A breeder here would not give five guineas for the best
                    brood-mare in the kingdom, unless she could draw or carry him occasionally to
                    market, nor a guinea extraordinary for one which could do both. He would sooner
                    breed from a rip which he happens to have upon his premises, though not worth a
                    month’s keep. But how absurd! The price of the leap, the keep of the mare, and
                    the care and keep of her progeny, from the time they drop to the time of sale,
                    are the same, whether they be sold from ten to fifteen, or from forty to fifty
                    pounds each.” (Marshall’s <hi rend="italic">Economy of Yorkshire,</hi> vol. ii.
                    p. 166.)</p>
                <p>In those districts where the breeding of horses is carried on upon a large scale,
                    and upon a regular plan, the rearing of stallions forms in some degree a
                    separate branch, and is confined, as in the case of bulls and rams, to a few
                    eminent breeders. These stallions, which are shown at the different towns in the
                    vicinity,—sometimes sent to be exhibited at a considerable distance,—are let out
                    for the whole season, or sold to stallion-men, or kept by the breeder himself,
                    for covering such mares as may be offered, at a certain price per head; and this
                    varies according to the estimation in which the horse is held, and sometimes
                    according as the mare has more or less of what is cal⅛d <hi rend="italic"
                    >blood.</hi> For farm-mares, the charge for covering by a stallion of the same
                    kind is commonly about a guinea, with half-a-crown to the groom; and it is a
                    common practice in the north to agree for a lower rate if the mare does not
                    prove with foal; sometimes nothing more is paid in that case than the allowance
                    to the groom.</p>
                <p>The age at which the animals should be allowed to copulate is not determined by
                    uniform practice, and is made to depend in some measure on the degree of
                    maturity, which, in animals of the same species, is more or less early,
                    according to breed and feeding. Yet it would seem in general to be an improper
                    practice to allow animals to propagate while they are themselves in a raw,
                    unformed state, and require all the nutriment which their food affords, for
                    raising them to the ordinary size of the variety to which they belong. It may,
                    therefore, be seldom advisable to employ the stallion till he is about three
                    years old, or the mare till she is a year older. But the greater number of mares
                    kept for breeding are much older than this, and are, in many cases, not allowed
                    to bring foals till they are in the decline of life, or otherwise unable to bear
                    their full share in rural labour.</p>
                <p>In the breeding of horses, as in all other kinds of live stock, it is of
                    importance that, at the season of parturition, there should be a suitable supply
                    of food for the young. The time of covering mares ought, therefore, to be partly
                    regulated by a due regard to this circumstance, and may be earlier in the south
                    than in the north, where grass, the most desirable food both for the dam and
                    foal, does not come so early by a month or six weeks. In Scotland it is not
                    advantageous to have mares to drop their foals sooner than the middle of April;
                    and, as the period of gestation is about eleven months, they are usually covered
                    in May, or early in June. But if mares are intended to bring a foal every year,
                    they should be covered from the ninth to the eleventh day after foaling,
                    whatever may be the time; and the horse should be brought to them again nine or
                    eighteen days afterwards.</p>
                <p>The mares are worked in summer as usual, and more moderately in the ensuing
                    winter, till near the time of foaling, when, if the season be somewhat advanced,
                    even though the pasture be not fully sufficient for their maintenance, they
                    should, be turned out to some grass field near the homestead, and receive such
                    additional supply of food as may be necessary, under sheds adjoining. It is both
                    inconvenient and dangerous to confine a mare about to foal in a common stable,
                    and still more so to leave her loose in a close stable among other horses; and
                    confinement is not much less objectionable after dropping her foal. Such sheds
                    are also exceedingly convenient even after grass has become abundant, as the
                    weather is often cold and rigorous during the month of May. When the foal is a
                    few weeks old, the mare is again put to light work; and she is separated from
                    the foal altogether, after having nursed it for about six months.</p>
                <p>Breeding mares are evidently unable to endure the fatigue of constant labour for
                    some months before and after parturition. This has led a few farmers to rear
                    foals upon cow-milk; but the practice is neither common, nor likely ever to
                    become so. The greater number of horses, therefore, are bred in situations where
                    a small portion of arable land is attached to farms chiefly occupied with cattle
                    or sheep, or where the farms are so small as not to afford full and constant
                    employment to the number of horses that must nevertheless be kept for the labour
                    of particular seasons.</p>
                <p>“During the first winter, foals are fed on hay, with a little com, but should not
                    be constantly confined to the stable; for even when there is nothing to be got
                    on the fields, it is much in their favour to be allowed exercise out of doors. A
                    considerable proportion of succulent food, such as potatoes, carrots, and
                    Swedish turnips (oilcake has been recommended), should be given them through the
                    first winter; and bean and peas meal has been advantageously substituted for
                    oats, which, if allowed in a considerable quantity, are injurious to the
                    thriving of the young animal, from their heating and astringent nature. Their
                    pasture, during the following summer, depends upon the circumstances of the
                    farms on which they are reared. In the second winter they are fed in much the
                    same manner as in the first, except that straw may be given for some months
                    instead of hay; and in the third winter they have a greater allowance of com, as
                    they are frequently worked at the harrows in the ensuing spring, when about
                    three years old.” <hi rend="italic">(General Report of Scotland,</hi> vol. iii.
                    p∙ 183.)</p>
                <p>The rearing of horses is carried on in some places in so systematical a manner,
                    as to combine the profit arising from the advance in the age of the animals,
                    with that of a moderate degree of labour before they are fit for the purposes to
                    which they are ultimately destined. In the ordinary practice of the midland
                    counties, the breeders sell them while yearlings, or perhaps when foals, namely,
                    at six or eighteen months old, but most generally the latter. They are mostly
                    bought up by the graziers of Leicestershire, and the other grazing parts of that
                    district, where they are <hi rend="italic">grown</hi> among the grazing stock
                    until the autumn following. At two years and a half old they are bought up by
                    the arable farmers, or dealers of Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, and
                    other western counties, where they are broken into harness, and worked till they
                    are five, or more generally six years old. At this age the dealers buy them up
                    again to be sent to London, where they are finally purchased for drays, carts,
                    waggons, coaches, the army, or any other purpose for which they are found fit.

                <p>A similar mode of transferring young horses from hand to hand is common in the
                    west of Scotland. The farmers of Ayrshire and the counties adjacent, who
                    generally crop not more than one-fourth, or at most one-third, of their <pb

                    occupy the remainder with a dairy-stock, <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> purchase
                    young horses at the fairs of Lanark and Carn-wath before mentioned,—work them at
                    the harrows in the following spring when below two years old,—put them to the
                    plough next winter at the age of two years and a half, and continue to work them
                    gently till they are five years old, when they are sold again at the Rutherglen
                    and Glasgow markets, at a great advance of price, to dealers and farmers from
                    the south-eastern counties. A considerable number of horses, however, are now
                    bred in the Lothians, Berwickshire, and Roxburghshire, the very high prices of
                    late having rendered it profitable to breed them, even upon good arable land.
                    But many farmers of these counties, instead of breeding, still prefer purchasing
                    two and a half or three and a half year old colts, at the markets in the west
                    country, or at Newcastle fair in the month of October. They buy in a certain
                    number yearly, and sell an equal number of their work-horses before they are so
                    old as to lose much of their value; so that their stock is kept up without any
                    other loss than such as arises from accidents; and the greater price received
                    for the horses they sell is often sufficient to cover any such loss. <hi

                <p>Castration is performed on the males commonly when they are about a year old; but
                    a late writer strongly disapproves of delaying this operation so long, and
                    recommends <hi rend="italic">twitching</hi> the colts (a practice well known to
                    rambreeders) any time after they are a week old, or as soon after as the
                    testicles are come down; and this method, he says, he has followed himself with
                    great success. (Parkinson <hi rend="italic">on Live Stock,</hi> vol. ii. p. 74.)
                    Another writer suggests, for experiment, the <hi rend="italic">spaying</hi> of
                    mares, thinking they would work better and have more wind than geldings.
                    (Marshall’s <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire,</hi> vol. ii. p. 169.) But he does not
                    appear to have been aware that this is by no means a new experiment; for Tusser,
                    who wrote in 1562, speaks of <hi rend="italic">folding fillies</hi> as a common
                    practice at that period. The main objection to this operation is not that
                    brood-mares would become scarce, as he supposes, but that, by incapacitating
                    them from breeding, m case of accidents and in old age, the loss on this
                    expensive species of live stock would be greatly enhanced. An old or lame mare
                    would dien be as worthless as an old or lame gelding is at present.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Feeding and Working.</hi></p>
                <p>The age at which horses are put to full work, in the labours of a farm, is
                    usually when four or five years old, according to the nature of the soil and the
                    numbers of die team; but they are always understood to be able to pay for their
                    maintenance after they are three years old, by occasional work in ploughing and
                    harrowing.</p>
                <p>lt is not so common a practice as it should be to subject young horses of this
                    kind to any regular course of training; but they are made familiar with their
                    keeper as soon as they are weaned, led about in a halter, rubbed down in the
                    stable, and treated with gentleness; and before being put to work, it is usual
                    to place them under the charge of a steady, careful servant, who very soon
                    learns them to drag a harrow alongside of an older horse, and afterwards to take
                    their share of the labour at the plough, and, by degrees, in all the other work
                    of the farm.</p>
                <p>With regard to the mode of feeding and working them, and their treatment in
                    general, the practice is so various, according to the state of agriculture in
                    different districts, and the circumstances of their owners, that all that can be
                    done here is to mention some leading points of management, in which all good
                    farmers are agreed.</p>
                <p>The selection of horses adapted to particular situations is evidently a matter of
                    primary consideration. It has been already hinted that the heavy, black
                    cart-horses, so much valued in London and a few other great towns, are but ill
                    adapted to the operations of modem husbandry ;' and the nature of the soil and
                    surface, and the situation of a farm in regard to markets, manure, and fuel,
                    require some difference in the strength, activity, and hardiness of this
                    instrument of labour. Accordingly, in the northern counties of Britain, where
                    economy in this department is more attended to than in the south, we find horses
                    of considerable strength, and a moderate share of activity, employed on firm,
                    cohesive soils; and on light, friable soils, such as are possessed of more
                    activity, not apt from their weight to be soon fatigued by working on an unequal
                    surface, and able to endure travelling, with a moderate load, for a considerable
                    distance, without injury.</p>
                <p>Whatever may be the description of horses employed, it is always a rule with good
                    managers never to allow them to fall off in condition so much as to be incapable
                    of going through their work without frequent applications of the lash. There is
                    nothing which more clearly marks the unprosperous condition of a tenant, than
                    the leanness of his working cattle, and their reluctant movements under this
                    severe stimulus. There are particular operations, indeed, such as turnip-sowing,
                    seeding fallows, harvestwork, &amp;c. which require to be executed with so great
                    dispatch in our variable climate, that unusual exertions are often
                    indispensable. At these times it is hardly possible, by the richest food and the
                    most careful treatment, to prevent the animals from losing flesh, sometimes even
                    when their spirit and vigour are not perceptibly impaired. Such labours,
                    however, do not continue long, and should always be followed by a corresponding
                    period of indulgence. It is particularly dangerous and unprofitable to begin the
                    spring labour with horses worn down by bad treatment during winter.</p>
                <p>Much has been said about the great expense of feeding horses on corn and hay, and
                    various roots have been recommended as advantageous substitutes. That these
                    animals can ever be made to perform their labour, according to the <hi
                    rend="italic">present</hi> courses of husbandry, on carrots, turnips, potatoes,
                    or other roots alone, or as their <hi rend="italic">chief</hi> food, our own
                    experience and observation lead us to consider as very improbable· They will
                    work and thrive on such food; but they will work as much more, and thrive as
                    much better, with oats or beans in addition, as fully to repay the difference in
                    expense. One of the three meals a day which farm-horses usually receive may
                    consist of roots, and a few of them every twenty-four hours are highly conducive
                    to the health of the animals; but we have never had occasion to see any horse
                    work regularly throughout the year, in the way they are usually worked in the
                    best cultivated districts, without an allowance of at least an English peck of
                    oats, or mixed oats and beans, daily, less or more at particular periods, but
                    rather more than this quantity for at least nine months in the year.</p>
                <p>It has been already observed, that machines are in some places used for cutting
                    hay and straw into chaff, for bruising or breaking down corn, and for preparing
                    roots and other articles by means of steam. The advantages of these practices,
                    both in regard to the economy of food and the health of the animals, are too
                    evident to require illustration. But the custom, which has been adopted by a few
                    individuals, and injudiciously recommended by others, of cutting down oats with
                    their straw into the state of chaff, without being previously threshed, is
                    wasteful and slovenly in the extreme. The proportion, as to quantity or quality,
                    which the oats bear to the bulk of the straw, being various in every season, and
                    almost in every field, the proper allowance of oats can be served out only <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193033969" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3969-0320"/> by first
                    separating them from the straw, and then mixing them with the cut straw or
                    chaff, in suitable proportions, before being laid into the manger.</p>
                <p>The work performed is evidently a question of circumstances, which does not admit
                    of any precise solution. It has been observed in the section on tillage,' that a
                    two-horse plough may, on an average, work about an English acre a day throughout
                    the year; and, in general, according to the nature of the soil, and the labour
                    that has been previously bestowed on it, a pair of horses, in ploughing, may
                    travel daily from ten to fifteen miles, overcoming a degree of resistance equal
                    to from four to ten hundredweights. On a well-made road, the same horses will
                    draw about a ton in a two-wheeled cart for twenty or twenty-five miles every
                    day; and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the better sort, in the slow movement of
                    the carrier or waggoner, commonly draws this weight by himself on the best
                    turnpike roads. In some places horses are in the yoke, when the length of the
                    day permits, nine hours, and in others ten hours a day; but, for three or four
                    months in winter, only from five to eight hours. In the former season they are
                    allowed to feed and rest two hours from mid-day; and, in the latter, they have a
                    little corn on the field when working as long as there is day-light, but none if
                    they work only five or six hours.</p>
                <p>In the section on farm-buildings, we have described with some minuteness the
                    construction and interior arrangement of modern stables; and it is only
                    necessary to add here, that the stable-management of horses has been greatly
                    improved of late years. It is not long since there were instances, even in the
                    Border counties, of horses being turned loose into a stable, without racks or
                    mangers, and without any other litter than the straw intended for their food,
                    which they tossed about in all directions. Even those farmers who found it
                    necessary to confine them to separate <hi rend="italic">stances,</hi> did not
                    see the advantage of separating them by partitions, but left them standing, as
                    is too generally the case at present with cattle, at liberty to inflict, and
                    exposed to endure, serious injuries and privations. When at last they were
                    confined in stalls, it was common to place two in each, by way of saving room
                    and the expense of partitions; and with the same view they were made to stand in
                    double rows, one row on each gable or side-wall, the hind legs of each row so
                    near those of the opposite one as to leave little room for carrying away their
                    dung without danger, and to afford little security against the attacks from
                    behind of vicious horses placed on the opposite sides of the stable. That all
                    these inconveniences are avoided in the present stables, must be evident from
                    the description already given, and the engraving there referred to.</p>
                <p>It is now well understood that the liberal use of the brush and the currycomb
                    twice a day,—frequent but moderate meals, consisting of a due proportion of
                    succulent joined to more solid food,—abundance of fresh litter, and great
                    attention to method and cleanliness, are as indispensable in the stable of a
                    farmer (as far as is consistent with a just regard to economy) as they have
                    always been held to be in the treatment of horses kept for pleasure. Good
                    dressing, with all well-informed and attentive men, is considered to be no less
                    necessary to the thriving of the horses than good feeding: according to a common
                    expression, it is equal to half their food. We shall conclude this section with
                    an extract from a recent publication, for the purpose of explaining the minutiae
                    of management adopted in the most improved counties of Scotland.</p>
                <p>“For about four months in summer, horses are fed on pastures, or on clover and
                    ryegrass, and tares cut green and brought home to the stable or fold-yard; the
                    latter method being by far the most economical and advantageous. For other eight
                    months they are kept on the straw of oats, beans, and peas, and on clover and
                    ryegrass hay. As soon as the grass fails towards the end of autumn, they have
                    hay for a few weeks; and when the days become so short as to allow of no more
                    than from six to eight hours’ work, they are very generally fed with different
                    kinds of straw, according to the circumstances of the farm. In the month of
                    March they are again put to hay, till the grass is ready for being cut.
                    Throughout all the year they are allowed more or less corn when constantly
                    worked; and during the time they are on dry fodder, particularly when on straw,
                    they have potatoes, yams, or Swedish turnips, once a day, sometimes boiled
                    barley, and, in a few instances, carrots. A portion of some of these roots is of
                    great importance to the health of horses, when succulent herbage is first
                    exchanged for hay at the end of autumn; and it is no less so towards the latter
                    end of spring, when hay has become sapless, and the labour is usually severe. At
                    these two periods, therefore, it is the practice of all careful managers to give
                    an ample allowance of some of these roots, even though they should be withheld
                    for a few weeks during the intermediate period.</p>
                <p>“The quantity of these different articles of food must depend on the size of the
                    horses, and the labour they perform; and the value, upon the prices of different
                    seasons, and in every season, on the situation of the farm with respect to
                    markets, particularly for hay and roots, which bring a very different price near
                    large towns, and at a few miles distance. It is for these reasons that the
                    yearly expense of a horse’s maintenance has been estimated at almost every sum
                    from L.15 to L.40. But it is only necessary to attend to the expense of feeding
                    horses that are capable of performing the labour required of them under the most
                    correct and spirited management. Such horses are fed with oats, sometimes with
                    beans, three times a day, for about eight months; and twice a day for the other
                    four, when at grass; and, at the rate of eight feeds per bushel, each horse will
                    eat fifteen quarters of oats, or twenty bolls Linlithgow measure, in the year.
                    When on hay, he will require about one stone of twenty-two pounds avoirdupois
                    daily, and five pounds more if he does not get roots. One English acre of clover
                    and ryegrass, and tares, may be necessary for four months soiling; and a quarter
                    of an acre of potatoes, yams, or Swedish turnips, during the eight months he is
                    fed with hay or straw. The use of these roots may admit of a small diminution of
                    the quantity of corn m the winter months, or a part of it may be, as it almost
                    always is, of an inferior quality.”</p>
                <p>The expense of a horse-plough must be different according to the situation, but
                    is in every case considerable. The feeding of the horses, with the interest of
                    capital, decline in value, and loss by accidents or disease, and the charges for
                    harness, shoeing, and farriery, were calculated, towards the latter end of the
                    last war, when the prices were high, at from L.90 to L.100 per annum, which,
                    with the wages of the ploughman, would be equal to 4Ós. for every acre of the
                    land which they cultivated; but with present prices an abatement may be made of
                    20 or 25 per cent.; reducing the whole charges upon a plough, wages included, to
                    about L.100 per annum, and the expense per acre to 30s. or 32s. It is no doubt
                    true that the expense is in many places considerably less than this; but we
                    speak here of horses fully employed throughout the year, and in the improved
                    system of husbandry. Farmers who keep their accounts in a proper manner charge
                    for every day’s work of a man and a pair of horses from 7s. 6d. to 10s.; and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193033982" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3982-0321"/> when land is in
                    an ordinary state of cultivation, it is sometimes let out to plough at the rate
                    of 6s. to 8s. per acre.</p>
                <p>It has been long alleged that oxen might be beneficially substituted for horses,
                    in the common operations of agriculture; and a great many calculations have been
                    submitted to the public on both sides of the question. Startling as it may seem,
                    however, these calculations prove nothing. The first point is to show, that the
                    two animals are equally adapted to every sort of farm labour. There are other
                    elements which enter into this question than the actual expenditure on either
                    side; and with reference to the present state of agriculture in this country, we
                    hold it as a fact ascertained by general experience, that oxen cannot be
                    employed with advantage, except in particular sorts of labour which do not go on
                    all the year round, but are only performed occasionally or at certain seasons.
                    The constant employment of oxen, to the entire exclusion c.f horses, is, we
                    venture to assert, impracticable in this country, and, if it were practicable,
                    would not be profitable. It is readily admitted, that oxen are well adapted t-)
                    the ploughing of coarse tough swards, .and other lands so much occupied with
                    stones or roots as to require a slow and steady power. They have also been found
                    useful for threshing-machines worked by animal power, for the same reason. But
                    in almost all the other kinds of labour necessary upon an extensive farm, oxen,
                    such at least as are bred in this country, are troublesome, inefficient, slow,
                    and improfitable labourers. They are not suited to the cart or waggon, even on
                    our fields, and far less for travelling upon our public roads. They cannot
                    perform their work with the dispatch necessary in our variable climate at
                    seedtime and harvest; and in the preparing, manuring, and seeding of large
                    fields of turnip, a process which calls for so much exertion and dispatch in
                    Norfolk and other turnip counties, the employment of oxen is entirely
                    inadmissible. Within certain limits a horse will work according as he is fed;
                    but if an ox is pushed beyond his natural step, he is soon rendered useless.</p>
                <p>On a practical question of this nature it is experience alone that can decide;
                    and there is none as to which general experience is more conclusive. In the rude
                    state of agriculture which prevailed in this country before the introduction of
                    clover and turnips, oxen were, as they still continue to be in some parts of the
                    Continent, more gene* rally employed in the home work of a farm than horses; but
                    in the progress of improvement, oxen have been gradually laid aside, till horses
                    are now, with comparatively few exceptions, universally employed in their stead.
                    So much is this the case, that one might almost estimate beforehand the state of
                    agriculture in any district where oxen are in general use. But the change from
                    oxen to horses, in the labours of agriculture, is not confined to this country.
                    A similar change has been long going on on the Continent, particularly in
                    France, where, according to their best agricultural writers, the horse is
                    preferred for the same reasons as in this country. The advocates for the use of
                    oxen, in fact, are in general persons of little or no practical knowledge, who
                    look only to the original cost and the comparative expense of maintaining the
                    animals, with the accidents and diseases to which the horse is liable; but they
                    do not take into view what that cost and that expense of maintenance would be if
                    oxen were to come into general use, and how far this change would affect the
                    supply of our butcher market; nor do they consider the loss upon the ploughman’s
                    wages, when he goes over an acre a day or more with the one species of animals,
                    and not more than half as much with the other.</p>
                <p>They might reflect too upon the necessity there is for the employment of horses
                    in drays and waggons in our public streets and in long journeys. To provide for
                    the necessary supply, these horses must be reared as a part of the farmer’s live
                    stock; and as he begins to work them so early as at three years old, they return
                    to him much more than the price of their food, before they come to the age of
                    five or six years, which is as soon as they are fit for the waggoner or the
                    drayman. With all these considerations in view, the arguments drawn from the
                    husbandry of the Greeks and Romans, and the modern practice of other countries,
                    will have no more weight with the enlightened farmers of Britain than if it were
                    attempted to prove the superiority of manual and animal labour over machinery in
                    threshing and other operations. Such men will always continue to apply each
                    species of animal to its proper use, and seek for labour from the horse, and
                    beef from the ox; improving the breeds of both with a view to these distinct
                    objects, instead of vainly attempting to obtain meat and labour from the latter
                    animal. By this management, as we shall see immediately, our cattle are now
                    prepared for the butcher at a much earlier period than formerly, and afford an
                    adequate return in their carcass alone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cattle.</hi></p>
                <p>The purposes for which cattle are kept being more various, and cattle being also
                    for the most part not so completely domesticated as horses, this species
                    includes a much greater number of breeds and varieties. The different races have
                    been distinguished generally by tlte length of their horns, or by their having
                    no horns at all; and again subdivided, and more particularly described under the
                    names of the counties or districts where they are supposed to have originated,
                    where they most abound, or where they exist in the greatest purity.</p>
                <p>In Britain, as in most other countries, horses are useful only for the labour
                    they perform, though it is probable that nothing but prejudice prevents them
                    from enlarging, at least occasionally, the supply of human food; and to render
                    them fit for labour, they must sooner or later in their lives be entirely
                    subjected to the care and control of man. Cattle, on the other hand, except the
                    few kept for labour' and for their milk, have not, till of late (and even now
                    only in particular countries), been the objects of that discipline and those
                    experiments which seek to restrain habits acquired in a state of nature—to
                    improve forms and proportions, perpetuated and somewhat varied by climate,
                    surface, and herbage—and to cultivate and bring to perfection, with the greatest
                    possible economy, all those valuable properties with which nature has endowed
                    the inferior animals for the subsistence and the comfort of man. In most parts
                    of the world cattle are still merely the creatures of soil and climate; and it
                    is a striking evidence of the greater progress of social improvement in Britain,
                    that we possess races of cattle and sheep, formed in a great measure by skill
                    and industry, which excel beyond all comparison those of every other
                    country.</p>
                <p>The three great products of cattle—meat, milk, and labour—have each of them
                    engaged the attention of British agriculturists; but experience has not hitherto
                    justified the expectation that has been entertained of combining all these
                    desirable properties, in an eminent degree, in the same race. That form which
                    indicates the property of yielding the most milk, differs materially from that
                    which we know from experience to be combined with early maturity and the most
                    valuable carcass; and the breeds which are understood to give the greatest
                    weight of meat <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033995" xml:id="kp-eb0702-3995-0322"
                    />for the food they consume, and to contain the least proportion of offal, are
                    not those which possess, in the highest degree, the strength and activity
                    required in beasts of labour.</p>
                <p>As we propose to treat of the produce and manufacture of milk in a separate
                    article (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Dairy),</hi> we shall there have occasion to
                    notice those breeds of which the females are most valuable for the dairy; only
                    referring at present to Plate XIII. for an engraving of the Ayrshire cow, an
                    excellent race, spread over that and the counties adjacent. And as cattle are
                    seldom or never reared exclusively, or even chiefly, for the purpose of labour,
                    which is now in most parts of Britain performed entirely by horses, it will be
                    sufficient to apply our remarks in an especial manner to the races themselves,
                    and the modes of treatment which are best adapted to the production of beef.</p>
                <p>“Whatever be the breed,” says Mr Culley, “I presume that, to arrive at
                    excellence, there is one form or shape essential to all, which form I shall
                    attempt to give in the following description of a bull.</p>
                <p>“The head of the bull should be rather long, and muzzle fine; his eyes lively and
                    prominent; his ears long and thin; his horns white; his neck rising with a
                    gentle curve from the shoulders, and small and fine where it joins the head; his
                    shoulders moderately broad at the top, joining full to his chine and chest
                    backwards, and to the neck-vein forwards; his bosom open; breast broad, and
                    projecting well before his legs; his arms or fore thighs muscular, and tapering
                    to his knee; his legs straight, clean, and very fine boned; his chine and chest
                    so full as to leave no hollow behind the shoulders; the plates strong, to keep
                    his belly from sinking below the level of his breast; his back or loin broad,
                    straight, and flat; his ribs rising one above another, in such a manner that the
                    last rib shall be rather the highest, leaving only a small space to the hips or
                    hooks, the whole forming a round or barrel-like carcass; his hips should be wide
                    placed, round or globular, and a little higher than the back; the quarters (from
                    the hip to the rump) long, and instead of being square, as recommended by some,
                    they should taper gradually from the hips backward, and the turls or pottbones
                    not in the least protuberant; rump close to the tail; the tail broad, well
                    haired, and set on so high as to be in the same horizontal line with his back.”
                    (Culley <hi rend="italic">on Live Stock,</hi> p. 38.)</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Breeds.</hi></p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Long-horned</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lancashire</hi>
                    breed of cattle is distinguished from others by the length of their horns, the
                    thickness and firm texture of their hides, the length and closeness of their
                    hair, the large size of their hoofs, and coarse, leathery, thick necks: they are
                    likewise deeper in their fore quarters and lighter in their hind quarters than
                    most other breeds,—narrower in their shape, less in point of weight, than the
                    short-horns, though better weighers in proportion to their size; and though they
                    give considerably less milk, it is said to afford more cream in proportion to
                    its quantity.</p>
                <p>They are more varied in their colour than any of the other breeds; but, whatever
                    the colour be, they have in general a white streak along their back, which the
                    breeders term <hi rend="italic">finched,</hi> and mostly a white spot on the
                    inside of the hough. <hi rend="italic">(Id.</hi> p. 53.)</p>
                <p>In a general view, this race, notwithstanding the singular efforts that have been
                    made towards its improvement, remains with little alteration; for, excepting in
                    Leicestershire, none of the subvarieties (which differ a little in almost every
                    one of those counties where the long-horns prevail (have undergone any radical
                    change, nor any obvious improvement. The improved breed of Leicestershire is
                    said to have been formed by Mr Webster of Can-ley, near Coventry, in
                    Warwickshire, by means of six cows brought from the banks of the Trent about 90
                    years ago, which were crossed with bulls from Westmoreland and Lancashire. Mr
                    Bakewell of Dishley, in Leicestershire, afterwards got the lead as a breeder, by
                    selecting from the Canley stock; and the stocks of several other eminent
                    breeders have been traced to the same source. (Marshall’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Midkind Counties,</hi> vol. i. p. 318.) See Plate XIV.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Short-horned,</hi> sometimes called the Dutch breed, is
                    known by a variety of names, taken from the districts where they form the
                    principal cattle-stock, or where most attention has been paid to their
                    improvement. Thus, different families of this race are distinguished by the
                    names of the <hi rend="italic">Holderness,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teeswater,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire, Durham, Northumberland,</hi>
                    and other breeds. The Teeswater breed, a variety of short-horns, established on
                    the banks of the Tees, at the head of the vale of York, is at present in the
                    highest estimation, and is alleged to be the true Yorkshire short-horned breed.
                    Bulls and cows from this stock, purchased at most extraordinary prices, are
                    spread over all the north of England and the border counties of Scotland. The
                    bone, head, and neck of these cattle are fine; the hide is very thin, the chine
                    full, the loin broad, and the carcass throughout large and well fashioned; and
                    the flesh and fatting quality equal, or perhaps superior, to those of any other
                    large breed. The short-horns give a greater quantity of milk than any other
                    cattle; a cow usually yielding 24 quarts of milk per day, making three firkins
                    of butter during the grass season. Their colours are much varied, but they are
                    generally red and white mixed, or what the breeders call <hi rend="italic"
                    >flecked.</hi> See Plate XIV.</p>
                <p>“The heaviest and largest oxen of the short-horned breed, when properly fed,
                    victual the East India ships, as they produce the thickest beef, which, by
                    retaining its juices, is the best adapted for such long voyages. Our royal navy
                    should also be victualed from these; but, by the jobs made by contractors, and
                    other abuses, I am afraid our honest tars are often fed with beef of an inferior
                    quality. However, the coal ships from Newcastle, Shields, Sunderland, &amp;c.
                    are wholly supplied with the beef of these valuable animals.</p>
                <p>“These oxen commonly weigh from 60 to 100 stone (14 lb. to the stone), and they
                    have several times been fed to 120, 130, and some particular ones to upwards of
                    150 stone, the four quarters only.” (Culley <hi rend="italic">on Live
                    Stock,</hi> p. 48.)</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Middle-horned</hi> breeds comprehend in like manner
                    several local varieties, of which the most noted are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Devons,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Sussexes,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Herefords;</hi> the two last, according to Mr Culley, being varieties of the
                    first, though of a greater size, the Herefords being the largest. These cattle
                    are the most esteemed of all our breeds for the draught, on account of their
                    activity and hardiness. They do not milk so well as the short-horns, but are not
                    deficient in the valuable property of feeding at an early age, when not employed
                    in labour.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Devonshire</hi> cattle are “of a high red colour (if any
                    white spots, they reckon the breed impure, particularly if those spots run into
                    one another), with a light dun ring round the eye, and the muzzle of the same
                    colour; fine in the bone, clean in the neck, horns of a medium length bent
                    upwards, thin-faced and fine in the chops, wide in the hips, a tolerable barrel,
                    but rather flat on the sides, tail small and set on very high; they are
                    thin-skinned, and silky in handling, feed at an early age, or arrive at maturity
                    sooner than most other breeds.” (Culley <hi rend="italic">οη</hi><pb break="no"

                    Stock,</hi> p. 51.) Another writer observes, that they are a model for all
                    persons who breed oxen for the yoke. (Parkinson <hi rend="italic">on Live
                    Stock,</hi> vol. i. p. 112.) The weight of the cows is usually from 30 to 40
                    stone, and of the oxen from 40 to 60. The North Devon variety, in particular,
                    from the fineness in the grain of the meat, is held in high estimation in
                    Smithfield. (Dickson’s <hi rend="italic">Practical Agriculture,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    120.)</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sussex</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Herefordshire</hi> cattle
                    are of a deep red colour, with fine hair and very thin hides; neck and head
                    clean; horns neither long nor short, rather turning up at the points; in general
                    they are well made in the hind quarters, wide across the hips, rump, and
                    sirloin, but narrow in the chine; tolerably straight along the back; ribs too
                    flat; thin in the thigh; and bone not large. An ox, six years old, when fat,
                    will weigh from 60 to 100 stone, the fore quarters generally the heaviest. The
                    oxen are mostly worked from three to six years old, sometimes till seven, when
                    they are turned off for feeding. The Hereford cattle are next in size to the
                    Yorkshire short-horns. Both this and the Gloucester variety are highly eligible
                    as dairy stock, and the females of the Herefords have been found to fatten
                    better at three years old than any other kind of cattle except the spayed
                    heifers of Norfolk. (Marshall’s <hi rend="italic">Economy of

                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Polled</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hornless</hi> breeds.
                    The most numerous and esteemed variety is the Galloway breed, so called from the
                    province of that name, in the south-west of Scotland, where they most abound.
                    The true Galloway bullock “is straight and broad on the back, and nearly level
                    from the head to the rump; broad at the loins, not, however, with hooked bones,
                    or projecting knobs; so that when viewed from above, the whole body appears
                    beautifully rounded, like the longitudinal section of a roller. He is long in
                    the quarters, but not broad in the twist. He is deep in the chest, short in the
                    leg, and moderately fine in the bone, clean in the chop and in the neck. His
                    head is of a moderate size, with large, rough ears, and full but not prominent
                    eyes or heavy eye-brows, so that he has a calm, though determined look. His
                    well-proportioned form is clothed with a loose and mellow skin, adorned with
                    long, soft, glossy hair.” <hi rend="italic">( Galloway Report,</hi> p. 236.) The
                    prevailing colour is black or dark brindled; and, though they are occasionally
                    found of every colour, the dark colours are uniformly preferred, from a belief
                    that they are connected with superior hardiness of constitution. The Galloways
                    are rather under-sized, not very different from the size of the Devons, but as
                    much less than the longhorns as the long-horns are less than the short-horns. On
                    the best farms the average weight of bullocks three years and a half old, when
                    the greater part of them are driven to the south, has been stated at about forty
                    stone avoirdupois. Some of them, fattened in England, have been brought to
                    nearly one hundred stone. See Plate XV.</p>
                <p>The general properties of this breed are well known in almost every part of
                    England, as well as in Scotland. They are sometimes sent from their native
                    pastures directly to Smithfield, a distance of 400 miles, and sold at once to
                    the butcher; and in spring they are often shown in Norfolk, immediately after
                    their arrival, in as good condition, or even better than when they began their
                    journey. With full feeding, there is perhaps no breed that sooner attains
                    maturity, and their flesh is of the finest quality. Mr Culley was misinformed
                    about the quantity of milk they yield, which, though rich, is by no means
                    abundant.</p>
                <p>“It is alleged not to be more than seventy or eighty years since the Galloways
                    were all horned, and very much the same, in external appearance and character,
                    with the breed of black-cattle which prevailed over the west of Scotland at that
                    period, and which still abound in perfection, the largest sized ones in
                    Argyllshire, and the smaller in the Isle of Skye. The Galloway cattle, at the
                    time alluded to, were coupled with some hornless bulls, of a sort which do not
                    seem now to be accurately known, but which were then brought from Cumberland;
                    the effects of which crossing were thought to be the general loss of horns in
                    the former, and the enlargement of their size; the continuance of a hornless
                    sort being kept up by selecting only such for breeding, or perhaps by other
                    means, as by the practice of eradicating with the knife the horns in their very
                    young state.” (Coventry <hi rend="italic">on Live Stock,</hi> p. 28.)</p>
                <p>The Galloway cattle, besides occupying almost exclusively the stewartry of
                    Kirkcudbright and the shire of Wigton, the two divisions of Galloway, are now
                    spread over the adjoining county of Dumfries, and are to be found in smaller
                    numbers in most of the other districts of Scotland. The cattle of Angus or
                    Forfarshire, on the east coast, many of which are also without horns, resemble
                    the Galloways in their colour, size, and general properties.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Suffolk Duns,</hi> according to Mr Culley, are nothing more
                    than a variety of the Galloway breed. He supposes them to have originated in the
                    intercourse that has long subsisted between the Scotish drovers of Galloway
                    cattle, and the Suffolk and Norfolk graziers who feed them. The Suffolks are
                    almost all light duns, thus differing from the Galloways; and are considered a
                    very useful kind of little cattle, particularly for the dairy.<note

                <p>5. The cattle of the Highlands of Scotland are divided into a number of local
                    varieties, some of which differ materially from others, probably owing to a
                    difference in the climate and the quality of the herbage, rather than to their
                    being sprung from races originally distinct, or to any great change effected
                    either by selection or by crossing with other breeds. It is only of late that
                    much attention has been paid to their improvement in any part of that extensive
                    district; and in the northern and central Highlands the cattle are yet, for the
                    most part, in as rude a state, and under management as defective, as they were
                    some centuries ago.</p>
                <p>These cattle have almost exclusive possession of all that division of Scotland,
                    including the Hebrides, marked off by a line from the Frith of Clyde on the west
                    to the Moray Frith on the north, and bending towards the east till it approaches
                    in some places very near to the German Ocean. Along the eastern coast, north of
                    the Frith of Forth, the Highland cattle are intermixed with various local
                    breeds, of which they have probably been the basis. There are more or less
                    marked distinctions among the cattle of the different Highland counties; and, in
                    common language, we speak of the Inverness-shire, the Banffshire, &amp;c.
                    cattle, as if they were so many separate breeds; but it is only necessary in
                    this place to notice the two more general varieties, now clearly distinguishable
                    by their form, size, and general properties.</p>
                <p>The most valuable of these are the cattle of the Western Highlands and Isles,
                    commonly called the <hi rend="italic">Argyllshire breed,</hi> or the breed of
                    the Isle of Skye, one of the islands attached to the county of Inverness. The
                    cattle of the Hebrides are called <hi rend="italic">Kyloes,</hi> a name which is
                    often applied in the south to all the varieties of the Highland cattle, not, as
                    a late writer (Dickson’s <hi rend="italic">Practical Agriculture,</hi> vol.
                    ii.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034021" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4021-0324"/>
                <p>p. 1124) has imagined, from the district in Ayrshire called Kyle, where very few
                    of them are kept, but from their crossing, in their progress to the south, the
                    <hi rend="italic">kyloes</hi> or ferries in the mainland and Western Islands,
                    where these cattle are found in the greatest perfection. (<hi rend="italic"
                    >General Re</hi><hi rend="italic">port</hi><hi rend="italic">of Scotland,</hi>
                    vol. iii. p. 26.)</p>
                <p>A bull of the Kyloe breed should be of a middle size, capable of being fattened
                    to fifty stone avoirdupois. His colour should be black, or dark brown, or
                    reddish brown, without any white or yellow spots# His head should be rather
                    small, his muzzle fine, his horns equable, not very thick, of a clear green and
                    waxy tinge; his general appearance should combine agility, vivacity, and
                    strength; and his hair should be glossy, thick, and vigorous, indicating a sound
                    constitution and perfect health. See Plate XV.</p>
                <p>For a bull of this description Mr Macneil of Colonsay refused 200 guineas; and
                    for one of an inferior sort he actually received L.170 sterling. Mr Macdonald of
                    Staffa bought one, nine years old, at 100 guineas. <hi rend="italic">(Report
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">the Hebrides,</hi> p. 425.)</p>
                <p>The lean weight of the best stock, from three to four years old, when they are
                    commonly sold to the south, is from twenty-six to thirty stone the four
                    quarters; but when brought to good pastures, they can be easily raised to fifty
                    stone and upwards. There is perhaps no other breed whose weight depends so much
                    on feeding, nor any that fattens and grows so much at the same time. They are
                    exceedingly hardy, easily maintained, speedily fattened on pastures where large
                    animals could scarcely subsist; the beef is fine in the grain, and well marbled
                    or intermixed with fat; and their milk is rich, but small in quantity.</p>
                <p>The other variety of Highland cattle is the <hi rend="italic">Norlands,</hi> or
                    North Highlanders, including the stocks of the counties of Ross, Cromarty,
                    Sutherland, Caithness, and parts adjacent. Their hides are generally coarse,
                    backs high and narrow, ribs flat, bones large, and legs long and feeble for the
                    weight of the chest; and they are considered very slow feeders. But though this
                    description be but too applicable to the cattle of the greater part of that
                    remote district, considerable improvement has been effected in many parts of it,
                    by crossing with the Skye or Argyll breeds, within the last twenty years.</p>
                <p>The cattle of the northern isles of Orkney and Zetland are of a most diminutive
                    size; an ox weighing about sixty pounds a quarter, and a cow forty-five pounds.
                    They are of all colours, and their shapes are generally bad; yet they give a
                    quantity of excellent milk, fatten rapidly when put on good pastures, and, in
                    their own district, are considered strong, hardy, and excellent workers, when
                    well trained to the yoke, and so plentifully fed as to enable them to support
                    labour.</p>
                <p>6. It has been already observed, that all along the lowlands of the eastern coast
                    of Scotland, to the north of the Frith of Forth, there are varieties of cattle
                    which, whatever may have been their origin, differ as much from the cattle of
                    the western and northern Highlands as most of those that have been described as
                    separate breeds. Of the Fifeshire cattle, Mr Culley observes, “You would at
                    first imagine them a distinct breed, from their upright white horns, being
                    exceedingly light-lyered and thin-thighed; but I am pretty clear it is only from
                    their being more nearly allied to the kyloes, and consequently less of the
                    coarse kind of short-horns in them.” (Culley <hi rend="italic">on Live</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Stock,</hi> p. 69.) Notwithstanding this opinion, the cattle of
                    the north-eastern counties of Scotland require, for every useful purpose, to be
                    mentioned separately from the Highland breeds; and as all of them have a general
                    resemblance, it will only be necessary, in this place, to notice the Fife cattle
                    in particular.</p>
                <p>There are various traditions about the origin of this variety. It is said to have
                    been much improved by English cows, sent by Henry VΠ. to his daughter, the
                    consort of James IV., who usually resided at the palace of Falkland in that
                    county; and as there is some resemblance between the cattle of Fife and
                    Cambridgeshire, they are supposed to have been brought originally from the
                    latter county. Others ascribe the origin of the present breed to bulls and cows
                    sent by James VI. (James I. of England), in payment of the money which his
                    obliging neighbours in Fife are said to have advanced for his equipment, when he
                    went to take possession of the English throne. <hi rend="italic">(Report of
                    Nairn and Moray,</hi> p. 305.)</p>
                <p>The prevailing colour of the Fife cattle is black, though sometimes spotted or
                    streaked with white, and some of them are altogether grey. The horns are small,
                    white, generally pretty erect, or at least turned up at the points, bending
                    rather forward, and not wide-spread like the Lancashire long-horned breed. The
                    bone is small in proportion to the carcass, the limbs clean but short, and the
                    skin soft. They are wide between the hook-bones; the ribs narrow, wide set, and
                    having a great curvature. They fatten quickly, and fill up well at all the
                    choice points; arc hardy, fleet, and travel well, and are excellent for labour,
                    both at plough and cart. A good cow of this breed gives from eighteen to
                    twenty-four quarts of milk per day, yielding from seven to nine pounds of
                    butter, and from ten to twelve pounds of cheese per week (twenty-four ounces to
                    the pound), for some months after calving. <hi rend="italic">(Fife Report,</hi>
                    p. 251 and 253.)</p>
                <p>'The cattle of Aberdeenshire, the largest of which are said to have been produced
                    by crossing with Fife bulls, have been long highly esteemed in the southern
                    markets. It is observed, that every succeeding generation of them has increased
                    in size for the last 30 years, and that the native breed has doubled its former
                    weight since the introduction of turnips. <hi rend="italic">(Aberdeenshire
                    Report,</hi> p. 468.) The colour is commonly black, but there are many of a red
                    and brindled colour. They are thinner in the buttock in proportion to their
                    weight, and deeper in the belly in proportion to their circumference, than the
                    West Highlanders, and they yield a much larger quantity of milk. Many of them
                    are brought to the south of Scotland, and kept during winter in the straw-yards,
                    for which they suit better than smaller cattle, as they are not so impatient of
                    confinement. The ordinary weight of middle-sized oxen, at from three to five
                    years old, is from forty to fifty stone; but after being worked for some time,
                    and thoroughly fattened, they have been known to reach double this weight.</p>
                <p>7. Of the <hi rend="italic">Welsh</hi> cattle “there seem to be two distinct
                    kinds. The large sort are of a brown colour, with some white on the rump and
                    shoulders, denoting a cross from the long-horns, though in shape not the least
                    resembling them. They are long in the legs, stand high according to their
                    weight, are thin in the thigh, and rather narrow in the chine; their horns are
                    white, and turned upwards; they are light in flesh, and, next to the Devons,
                    well formed‰ the yoke; have very good hoofs,, and walk light and nimble. The
                    other sort are much more valuable; colour black, with very little white; of a
                    good useful form, short in the leg, with round, deep bodies; the hide is rather
                    thin, with short hair; they have a lively look and a good eye; and the bones,
                    though not very small, are neither large nor clumsy; and the cows are considered
                    good milkers.” (Parkinson <hi rend="italic">on Live Stock,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    135.)</p>
                <p>8. The <hi rend="italic">Alderney</hi> cattle are to be met with only about <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193034034" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4034-0325"/> the seats of a
                    few great landholders, where they are kept chiefly for the sake of their milk,
                    which is very rich, though small in quantity. This race is considered by very
                    competent judges as too delicate and tender to be propagated to any extent in
                    Britain, at least in its northern parts. Their colour is mostly yellow or light
                    red, with white or mottled faces: they have short, crumpled horns, are small in
                    size, and very ill shaped; yet they are fine-honed in general; and their beef,
                    though high-coloured, is very well flavoured. I have seen, says Mr Culley, some
                    very useful cattle bred from a cross between an Alderney cow and a short-horned
                    bull.</p>
                <p>9. The last variety of cattle we shall mention is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ιcild</hi> breed, which is found only in the parks of a few great proprietors,
                    who preserve the animals as a curiosity. Those kept at Chillingham Castle in
                    Northumberland, a seat belonging to the earl of Tankerville, have been very
                    accurately described in the <hi rend="italic">Northumberland Report,</hi> and in
                    Mr Culley’s book <hi rend="italic">on Live Stock,</hi> so often quoted in this
                    article.</p>
                <p>“Their colour is invariably of a creamy white; muzzle black; the whole of the
                    inside of the ear, and about one-third of the outside, from the tips downward,
                    red'; horns white, with black tips, very fine, and bent upwards; some of the
                    bulls have a thin upright mane, about an inch and a half or two inches long. The
                    weight of the oxen is from 35 to 45 stone, and the cows from 25 to 35 stone the
                    four quarters (14 pound to the stone). The beef is finely marbled, and of
                    excellent flavour.</p>
                <p>“From the nature of their pasture, and the frequent agitation they are put into
                    by the curiosity of strangers, it is scarce to be expected they should get very
                    fat; yet the six-years-old oxen are generally very good beef, from whence it may
                    be fairly supposed that, in proper situations, they would feed well.</p>
                <p>“At the first appearance of any person they set off in full gallop, and, at the
                    distance of about 200 yards, make a wheel round and come boldly up again,
                    tossing their heads in a menacing manner; on a sudden they make a full stop, at
                    the distance of 40 or 50 yards, looking wildly at the object of their surprise,
                    but, upon the least motion being made, they all again turn round, and fly off
                    with equal speed, but not to the same distance, forming a shorter circle, and
                    again returning with a bolder and more threatening aspect than before; they
                    approach much nearer, probably within 30 yards, when they again make another
                    stand, and again fly off: this they do several times, shortening their distance,
                    and advancing nearer and nearer, till t!ιey come within such a short distance
                    that most people think it prudent to leave them, not choosing to provoke them
                    further.</p>
                <p>“The mode of killing them was perhaps the only modem remains of the grandeur of
                    ancient hunting. On notice being given that a wild bull would be killed on a
                    certain day, the inhabitants of the neighbourhood came mounted and armed with
                    guns, &amp;c. sometimes to the amount of 100 horse and 400 or 500 foot, who
                    stood upon walls or got into trees, while the horsemen rode off the bull from
                    the rest of the herd, until he stood at bay, when a marksman dismounted and
                    shot. At some of these huntings, 20 or 30 shots have been fired before he was
                    subdued. On such occasions the bleeding victim grew desperately furious, from
                    the smarting of bis wounds, and the shouts of savage joy that were echoing from
                    every side. But, from the number of accidents that happened, this dangerous mode
                    has been little practised of late years, the nark-keeper alone generally
                    shooting them with a rifled gun at one shot.</p>
                <p>“When the cows calve, they hide their calves for a week or ten days in some
                    sequestered situation, and go and suckle them two or three times a day. If any
                    person come near the calves, they clap their heads close to the ground, and he
                    like a hare in form, to hide themselves. This is a proof of their native
                    wildness, and is corroborated by the following circumstance that happened to the
                    writer of this narrative (Mr Bailey of Chillingham), who found a hidden calf,
                    two days old, very lean and very weak. On stroking its head it got up, pawed two
                    or three times like an old bull, bellowed very loud, stepped back a few steps,
                    and <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> at his legs with all its force; it then began
                    to paw again, bellowed, stepped back, and bolted as before; but knowing its
                    intention, and stepping aside, it missed him, fell, and was so very weak, that
                    it could not rise, though it made several efforts :—but it had done enough ;—the
                    whole herd were alarmed, and, coming to its rescue, obliged him to retire; for
                    the dams will allow no person to touch their calves, without attacking them with
                    impetuous ferocity.</p>
                <p>“λVhen a calf is intended to be castrated, the park-keeper marks the place where
                    it is hid, and when the herd are at a distance, takes an assistant with him on
                    horseback; they tie a handkerchief round the calf s mouth to prevent its
                    bellowing, and then perform the operation in the usual way, with as much
                    expedition as possible.— When any one happens to be wounded, or is grown weak
                    and feeble through age or sickness, the rest of the herd set upon it and gore it
                    to death.” (Culley <hi rend="italic">on Live Stock,</hi> p. 73.)</p>
                <p>2, <hi rend="italic">Breeding and Rearing.</hi></p>
                <p>Thŏ pedigrees of the best cattle have been preserved with no less care, in
                    several parts of England, than those of race-horses; and in the selection of
                    breeders, the properties of the family from which they have descended are
                    matters of scarcely less importance than the form of the young animals
                    themselves. In rearing calves, the <hi rend="italic">blood</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">colour</hi> seem to be more attended to by breeders in general
                    than the form. (Marshall’s <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire,</hi> vol. ii. p. 203.)
                    The extraordinary prices paid for the best bred bulls and cows, show that this
                    attention has not been without its reward.</p>
                <p>The best bulls are either let out for the season, or cows are brought to. them at
                    a certain rate per head. The practice of <hi rend="italic">letting</hi> bulls is
                    said to have originated with Mr Bakewell (Marshall’s <hi rend="italic">Midland
                    Counties,</hi> vol. i. p. 334), who, so far back as 1792, let a bull for 152
                    guineas, to be used only four months (Parkinson <hi rend="italic">on Live
                    Stock,</hi> vol. ii. p. 469); and five guineas per cow were about that time
                    commonly paid to him and other eminent breeders.</p>
                <p>The age at which bulls should begin to be employed, and the number of seasons
                    they should be allowed to serve, as well as the age at which the females should
                    begin to breed, are points regarding which practice is by no means uniform. In
                    the midland counties the bulls are pretty commonly allowed to leap while
                    yearlings, and, if good stock-getters, are kept on as long as they will serve,
                    perhaps till they are 10 or 12 years old. In other places they are employed only
                    three seasons, for the first time at two years old. The females in some
                    instances bring their first calf at the age of two years, but more commonly,
                    perhaps, not till they are a year older; and in some of the Highland districts,
                    where, owing to a want of proper nourishment in their infancy, they are later in
                    reaching their full growth, the females do not often become mothers till they
                    are about four years old.</p>
                <p>The period of gestation with cows has been found, upon an average of a great
                    number of experiments, to be about 40 weeks; and they seldom bring more than one
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034047" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4047-0326"/> calf at a
                    birth. When they produce twins, one of them a male and the other a female, the
                    latter, which is called a <hi rend="italic">free martin,</hi> is commonly
                    considered to be incapable of procreation. Yet there seem to have been
                    well-authenticated instances to the contrary. <hi rend="italic">(Farmer’s
                    Magazine,</hi> vol. vii. p. 462, and vol. viii. p. 466.)</p>
                <p>Though calves are dropped at all seasons of the year, the spring is the most
                    common period; and, except in those districts where the fatting of calves is an
                    object of importance, it is probably the most advantageous time, as the calves,
                    having all the grass season before them, become sufficiently strong for enduring
                    the change to a less agreeable food in the ensuing winter. A calf newly weaned
                    seldom thrives well during that period, unless it is pampered with better food
                    than usually falls to the share of young animals.</p>
                <p>In Galloway and the Highlands of Scotland the almost invariable practice is to
                    allow the calves to suck the cows, and this commonly as long as the cows give
                    any milk; most of them, indeed, will not give down their milk unless the calf is
                    put to one side of the udder, while the milkmaid draws the teats on the other
                    side; and if the maid gives the least interruption to her rival, the cow
                    punishes the fraud by a blow with her leg, often overturning both the offender
                    and the milking-pail. <hi rend="italic">(General Report of Scotland,</hi> vol.
                    iii. p. 47.) Where there is not an inclosure for confining the calves when they
                    are put to grass, a muzzle is made for the nose, with iron spikes fastened on
                    it, which prick the cow when the calf attempts to suck at forbidden times, and
                    obliges her to keep it off till the muzzle be removed at the stated periods' of
                    milking. But this is too troublesome where many of them are reared, in which
                    case they are kept apart from the cows till the hours of milking.</p>
                <p>This natural method of rearing calves is common, at least for a short time, in
                    other parts of Britain. Bull-calves, and sometimes high-bred heifers, are
                    suffered to remain at the teat until they be six, nine, or perhaps twelve months
                    old; letting them run either with their dams, or more frequently, especially
                    when the dairy is an object, with less valuable cows or heifers bought in for
                    the purpose, and, when the intention is fulfilled, sold or fatted; each cow
                    being generally allowed one male calf or two females.</p>
                <p>“The best method of the dairymen is this :—The calves suck a week or a fortnight,
                    <hi rend="italic">according to their strength</hi> (a good rule); new milk in
                    the pail, a few meals; next new milk and skim-milk mixed, a few meals more; then
                    skimmilk alone, or porridge made with milk, water, ground oats, &amp;c. and
                    sometimes oil-cake, until cheese-making commence; after which, whey porridge, or
                    sweet whey, in the field; being careful to house them in the night, until warm
                    weather be confirmed.” (Marshall’s <hi rend="italic">Midland Counties,</hi> vol.
                    i. p. 338.)</p>
                <p>This method of suckling is not, however, free from objection; and, in the
                    ordinary practice of rearing calves, it is held to be a preferable plan to begin
                    at once to learn them to drink from a pail. The calf that is fed from the teat
                    must depend upon the milk of its dam, however scanty or irregular it may be;
                    whereas, when fed from a dish, the quantity can be regulated according to its
                    age; and various substitutes may be resorted to, by which a part of the milk is
                    saved for other purposes, or a greater number of calves reared upon the same
                    quantity. (<hi rend="italic">General Report of Scotland,</hi> vol. iii. p. 51.)
                    Yet it would seem to be a good practice to allow calves to suck for a few days
                    at first, if there was no inconvenience to be apprehended both to themselves and
                    their dams from the separation afterwards.</p>
                <p>When fed from the pail, the average allowance to a calf is about two imperial
                    wine gallons of milk daily for 12 or 13 weeks; at first fresh milk as it is
                    drawn from the' cow, and afterwards skim-milk. But after it is three oy four
                    weeks old, a great variety of substitutes for milk are used in different places,
                    of which linseed, oil-cake, meal, and turnips, are the most common. The
                    practice, however, varies so much, no particular substitute being in general
                    use, nor the quantity, nor the time of giving it, accurately determined, that it
                    would be of no use to go into details here. For the feeding and treatment of
                    fattening calves, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Dairy.</hi></p>
                <p>It is a rule, applicable to all kinds of live stock, to perform castration, where
                    that is to be done, while the animals are yet very young, and just so strong as
                    to endure this severe operation without any great danger of its proving fatal.
                    The males, accordingly, are cut commonly when about a month old, and the females
                    at the age of from one to three months; but in Galloway, where more heifers are
                    <hi rend="italic">spayed</hi> than perhaps in all the island besides, this is
                    seldom done till they are about a year old.</p>
                <p>The treatment of young cattle from the time they are separated from their dams,
                    or able to subsist on the common food of the other stock, must entirely depend
                    upon the circumstances of the farm on which they are reared. In summer their
                    pasture is often coarse, but abundant; and in winter all good breeders give them
                    an allowance of succulent food along with their dry fodder. The following
                    description is not less applicable to the best practice in the rearing of all
                    cattle bred on arable land, than to the <hi rend="italic">short-horns</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:—</hi></p>
                <p>“The first winter they have hay and turnips; the following summer, coarse
                    pasture; the second winter, straw in the fold-yard, and a few turnips once a
                    day, in an adjoining field, just sufficient to prevent the straw from binding
                    them too much; the next summer, tolerably good pasture; and the third winter, as
                    many turnips as they can eat, and in every respect treated as fatting cattle.”
                    (Culley <hi rend="italic">on Live Stock,</hi> p. 47.) The only difference is,
                    that, where straw is in great abundance, the cattle sometimes do not eat their
                    turnips on the fields, but in the fold-yard. In those situations where turnips
                    cannot be extensively cultivated, or where cattle are sold for grazing instead
                    of being fattened, a Smaller allowance of turnips the third winter is made to
                    suffice.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Fatting.</hi></p>
                <p>Cattle are fatted on grass in summer, commonly on pastures, but in a few
                    instances on herbage cut and consumed in feeding-houses or fold-yards; and in
                    winter by far the greater number are fatted on turnips, along with hay or straw.
                    Oil-cake, carrots, potatoes, and other articles of food, are used occasionally,
                    and in particular districts; oil-cake chiefly for feeding the larger animals;
                    but few comparatively are fatted on any of these without the addition of turnips
                    of one or other of the varieties formerly mentioned. See Sect. VI. A
                    considerable number of cattle are also fatted on the offals of distilleries,
                    when working from com; a source of supply, the frequent interruption of which,
                    till of late, was much felt in those situations where the soil does not permit
                    the extensive cultivation of turnips.</p>
                <p>It is seldom or never the practice of the best managers to fatten cattle with
                    roots or other winter food on the field during that season, but to confine them
                    to houses or fold-yards, where they are well littered, regularly fed, not liable
                    to be disturbed, and sheltered from the inclemency of the weather,, and where
                    the manure they make is an object of Very considerable importance, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193034060" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4060-0327"/> of much greater
                    value than if it were dropped at random over a whole field.</p>
                <p>The age at which cattle are fatted depends upon the manner in which they have
                    been reared, upon the properties of the breed in regard to a propensity to
                    fatten earlier or later in life, and on the circumstances of their being
                    employed in breeding, in labour, for the dairy, or reared solely for the
                    butcher. In the latter case, the most improved breeds are fit for the shambles
                    when about three years old, and very few of any large breed are kept more than a
                    year longer. As to cows and working oxen, the age of fatting must necessarily be
                    more indefinite; in most instances the latter are put up to feed after working
                    three years, or in the seventh or eighth year of their age.</p>
                <p>In general it may be said that the small breeds of cattle are fattened on
                    pastures, though sometimes finished off on a few weeks’ turnips; and that large
                    cattle, at least in the north, arc chiefly fatted in stalls or fold-yards, by
                    means of turnips and the other articles before mentioned.</p>
                <p>Stall-feeding is the most common, and, when judiciously conducted, probably the
                    most eligible method in regard to the cattle themselves, the economy of food,
                    and the expense of farm-buildings. The small shed and fold-yard, called a <hi
                    rend="italic">hammd,</hi> are used only for the larger breeds; but they do not
                    seem well calculated for an extensive system of tatting by those who do not
                    breed, but purchase stock every year from different parts. See Chap. I. Sect.
                    II.</p>
                <p>Cattle, it is well known, have long been the staple produce of Scotland; and
                    since the union of South and North Britain, immense numbers have been carried
                    every year to the feeding pastures and markets of England. But besides this
                    transportation, so beneficial to both parts of the island, cattle often change
                    their pastures and their owners before leaving Scotland, according to
                    arrangements which, though not conducted with all the uniformity of system, are
                    found to be very advantageous to the individuals concerned, and ultimately to
                    the public at large.</p>
                <p>“The Highland cattle often pass through three different hands, or more, before
                    they come to the butcher. They are improved at every stage by a greater quantity
                    and better quality of food, instead of being suddenly transported from poor to
                    rich feeding; and while each successive owner applies his produce to the best
                    advantage, and receives a suitable return according to its value, from the
                    advance of price, the consumer at last purchases his beef cheaper, and of a
                    better quality, than if the cattle had been sent to the shambles from any of the
                    intermediate stages.</p>
                <p>“The West Highland cattle make this progress oftener than the larger cattle of
                    the north-eastern counties. Many of them are brought to Dumbartonshire and other
                    places at the age of two years and two years and a half, wintered on coarse
                    pastures, with a small allowance of bog-hay or straw, and moved to lower grounds
                    next summer. They are then driven farther south, where they get turnips in
                    straw-yards through the following winter, and in April are in high condition for
                    early grass, upon which they make themselves fat in the month of June.</p>
                <p>“The larger varieties of the north-eastern counties do not leave the breeder at
                    so early an age. They are seldom brought to market till they are three or three
                    years and a half old, and then frequently in good condition for being fattened,
                    either on grass or turnips. A great many of the Aberdeenshire cattle are bought
                    for the strawyards of the southern counties, get a few turnips through winter
                    and spring, and are either driven to England in April, or fattened at home in
                    the course of the ensuing summer. The Fife cattle, like the other breeds of the
                    Lowlands, are generally sold to the graziers at three years old, having got a
                    liberal allowance of turnips during the preceding winter.” (<hi rend="italic"
                    >General Report of Scotland,</hi> vol. iii.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the high degree of perfection to which some breeds of cattle have
                    been brought in England, and the great attention that is paid by the most
                    eminent breeders to every part of their management, several interesting points
                    are not by any means clearly ascertained. Much certainly remains to be known
                    regarding the nutriment afforded by different kinds of herbage and roots,— the
                    quantity of food consumed by different breeds, in proportion as well to their
                    weight at the time as to the ratio of their increase,—and the propriety of
                    preferring large or small animals in any given circumstances. Even with regard
                    to the degree of improvement made by fatting cattle generally, from the
                    consumption of a given weight of roots or herbage, no great accuracy is commonly
                    attempted; machines for weighing the cattle themselves and their food, from time
                    to time, not being yet in general use in any part of Britain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Sheep.</hi></p>
                <p>This species being still more than cattle exposed to all the influences of soil
                    and climate, displays a much greater variety in form, size, and general
                    properties. In different counties, though the breed be originally the same, a
                    very perceptible difference is found in all these respects; and there arc not
                    unfrequently considerable variations among the flocks of the same district, even
                    those of contiguous farms. Yet in other situations, where rich food is
                    abundantly supplied at all times of the year, sheep have been more highly
                    improved than any other animals; and the breeds most esteemed for the arable
                    land of Britain are in a great measure the creatures of the industry and
                    sagacity of man. Hardly any two animals are more unlike than the small dun-faced
                    sheep, supposed to be the most ancient of the kind in Britain, and the Leicester
                    or Dish-ley male, whose every point must be exactly formed according to an
                    established model of symmetry and usefulness.</p>
                <p>The various breeds of sheep, and the modes of management, almost as numerous as
                    these varieties, would require a much larger space for their description than it
                    is possible to allot to it in a section of this article.</p>
                <p>According to one writer (Culley <hi rend="italic">on Live Stock,</hi> p. 102),
                    there are fourteen different breeds of sheep in Great Britain, all of them
                    sufficiently distinguished by their horns, or by being hornless, by the colour
                    of their faces and legs, and by the length and quality of their wool. To these a
                    later writer adds two varieties more (Dickson’s <hi rend="italic">Practical
                    Agriculture,</hi> vol. ii. p. 1135); but a third work, still more recent
                    (Parkinson <hi rend="italic">on Live Stock,</hi> vol. i. p. 249), enumerates no
                    fewer than thirty-seven breeds, to each of which are assigned one or more
                    characteristic peculiarities. This great diversity renders it necessary to
                    decline a particular description of each: perhaps the most eligible mode of
                    classification would be, to consider separately those races which are best
                    adapted to inclosed arable-land; those which occupy green hills, downs, and
                    other tracts of moderate elevation; and, finally, such as inhabit the higher
                    hills and mountains. On the first description of land every sort of practicable
                    improvement may be’ effected, though there the carcass has hitherto been the
                    chief object; on the second the carcass is smaller, but the wool generally
                    finer,—and it is probably with such sheep that the greatest improvements ought
                    to be attempted on the fleece; and on the last division the breeds are
                    necessarily small and hardy, and, in regard to form and general pro <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193034073" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4073-0328"/> perties, still
                    almost in a state of nature. ’ The improvement of sheep must mainly depend on
                    the circumstances of every district, in regard to the food and shelter it
                    affords them; and it is only where these indispensable requisites are abundantly
                    provided by nature, or by human industry, that the most skilful management can
                    be successful. The sheep of the rugged heathy mountains of the Highlands of
                    Scotland must ever retain the form, the size, and the habits which the
                    uncontrollable influence of their situation has impressed on them.</p>
                <p>But this mode of classification is more applicable to the general management
                    adopted on' the several sorts of land, than to the present breeds themselves,
                    which are found intermixed in every district, and often even on the same field.
                    We shall therefore in this, as in the two former sections, describe the
                    distinguishing characteristics of the principal breeds as concisely as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>There is, however, in the case of sheep, as of all the other kinds of live stock,
                    a certain form,—a sort of standard established by experience and observation of
                    the best individuals,—to which it is wished that all the breeds of this species
                    should approach. Mr Culley, to whom we have so often referred, as being by far
                    the most skilful of our writers on live stock, thus describes the best form of a
                    ram :—</p>
                <p>“His head should be fine and small, his nostrils wide and expanded, his eyes
                    prominent and rather bold or daring, ears thin, his collar full from his breast
                    and shoulders, but tapering gradually all the way to where the neck and head
                    join, which should be very fine and graceful, being perfectly free from any
                    coarse leather hanging down; the shoulders broad and full, which must at the
                    same time join so easy to the collar forward, and chine backward, as to leave
                    not the least hollow in either place; the mutton upon his arm, or fore thigh,
                    must come quite to the knee; his legs upright, with a clean, fine bone, being
                    equally clear from superfluous skin and coarse hairy wool from the knee and
                    bough downwards; the breast broad and well forward, which will keep his fore
                    legs at a proper wideness; his girth or chest full and deep, and instead of a
                    hollow behind the shoulders, that part by some called the fore flank should be
                    quite full; the back and loins broad, flat, and straight, from which the ribs
                    must rise with a fine circular arch; his belly straight, the quarters long and
                    full, with the mutton quite down to ;the hough, which should neither stand
                    in,nor out; his twist deep, wide, and full, which, with the broad breast, will
                    keep his four legs open and upright; the whole body covered with a thin pelt,
                    and that with fine, bright, soft wool. &gt;</p>
                <p>“The nearer any breed of sheep comes up to the above description, the nearer they
                    approach towards excellence of form.” (Culley <hi rend="italic">on five
                    Stock,</hi> p. 103.)</p>

                <p>The sheep suited to arable land, in addition to such prope <hi rend="superscript"
                    > r</hi> ties as are common in some degree to all the different breeds, must
                    evidently be distinguished for their quietness and docilitj⅛ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> habits which, though gradually acquired and
                    established, by means of careful treatment, are more obvious, and may, be more
                    certainly depended on, in some b ceds. than in others. These properties are not
                    qnly valuable for the sake of the fences by which the ßheep are confined,, but
                    as a proof of the aptitude of the animals to acquire flesh in proportion to the
                    food they consume.</p>
                <p>, The long-woolled large breeds (the varieties usually preferred on good
                    grass-lands) differ much in form and size, and in their fatting quality, as well
                    as in the weight of their fleeces. The principal are, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lincoln,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Tecs-water,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dishley</hi> or <hi rend="italic">New Leicester.</hi></p>
                <p>In some instances, with the Lincolns in particular, wool seems to be an object
                    paramount even to the carcass; with the breeders of the Leicesters, on the other
                    hand, the carcass has always engaged the greatest attention; but neither form
                    nor fleece separately is a legitimate ground of preference, the most valuable
                    sheep being that which returns, for the food it consumes, the greatest
                    marketable value of produce.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lincolnshire breed</hi> have no horns; the face is white,'
                    and the carcass long and thin, the ewes weighing from 14 to 20 lb., and the
                    three-year-old wethers from 20 to 30 lb. per quarter. They have thick, rough,
                    white legs, bones large, pelts thick, and wool long,—from 10 to 18 inches,—-
                    weighing from 8 to 14 lb. per fleece, and covering a slow-feeding,
                    coarse-grained carcass of mutton.</p>
                <p>.This kind of sheep cannot be made fat at an early age, except upon the richest
                    land, such as Romney-marsh, and the rich marshes of Lincolnshire; yet the
                    prodigious weight of wool which is shorn from them every year is an inducement
                    to the occupiers of the marsh-land to give great prices to the breeders for
                    their hogs or yearlings; and though the buyers must keep them two years more
                    before they get them fit for market, they have three clips of wool in the mean
                    time, which of itself pays them well in those rich marshes. Not only the midland
                    counties, but also Yorkshire, Durham, and Northumberland, can send their
                    long-woolled sheep to market at two years old, fatter in general than
                    Lincolnshire can at three. Yet this breed, antl its subvarieties, are spread
                    through many of the English counties.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Teeswater</hi> breed differs from the Lincolnshire in’
                    their wool not being, so long and heavy; in standing upon higher, though
                    finer-boned legs, supporting a thicker, firmer, heavier carcass, much wider upon
                    their backs and sides; and in affording a fatter and finer-grained carcass of
                    mutton, the two-year-old wethers weighing from 25 to 35 lb. per quarter. Some
                    particular ones, at four years old, have been fed to 55 lb. and upwards.</p>
                <p>There is little doubt that the Teeswater sheep were originally bred from the
                    same, stock as the Lincolnshire, but, by attending to size rather than to wool,
                    and constantly pursuing that object, they have become a different variety of the
                    same original breed.</p>
                <p>“The present fashionable breed is smaller than the original species, but they are
                    still considerably larger and fuller of <hi rend="italic">bone</hi> than the
                    Midland breed. They bear an analogy to the short-horned breed of cattle, as
                    those of the Midland counties do to the long-horned. They are not so compact,
                    nor so complete in their form, as the Leicestershire sheep; nevertheless, the
                    excellency of their flesh and fatting quality is nöt doubted, and their wool
                    still remains of a superior staple. For the banks of the Tees, or any other rich
                    fat-land country, they may be singularly excellent.” (Marshall’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Yorkshire,</hi> vol. ii. p. 221.) Rams of this kind have been
                    employed of late in Northumber-land and Berwickshire, in crossing ewes of the
                    Leicester breed, but with what success there has not yet been time to
                    determine.</p>
                <p>The. <hi rend="italic">Dishley</hi> or <hi rend="italic">New .'Leicester</hi>
                    breed is distinguished from other long-wop∏ed breeds by their clean heads, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> straight, broad, flat backs, round, barrel-like
                    bodies, very fine small bones, thin pelts, and inclination to make fat at. an
                    early age. This last property is most probably owing to the .before-specified
                    qualities, and which, from long experience and observation, there is reason to
                    believe, extends through every species of domestic animals. The Dishley breed is
                    not only peculiar for its mutton being <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034086"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4086-0329"/>fat, but also for the fineness of the grain and
                    superior flavour, above all other large lòng-wooìled sheep, so as to fetch
                    nearly as good a price, in many markets, as the mutton of the small Highland and
                    short-woolled breeds. The weight of ewes three or four years old is from 18 to
                    26 lb. a quarter, and of wethers two years old from 20 to 30 lb. The wool, on an
                    average, is from 6 to 8 lb. a fleece. See Plate XVI.</p>
                <p>A fourth hornless variety of long-woolled sheep is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Devonshire Nots,</hi> having white faces and legs, thick necks, narrow backs,
                    and back-bone high; the sides good, legs short, and the bones large; weight much
                    the same as the Leicesters, wool heavier, but coarser. In the same county there
                    is a small breed of long-woolled sheep, known by the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Exmoor</hi> sheep, from the place where they are chiefly bred.
                    They are horned, with white faces and legs, and peculiarly delicate in bone,
                    neck, and head; but the form of the carcass is not good, being narrow and
                    flat-sided; the weight of the quarters and of the fleece about two-thirds that
                    of the former variety.</p>
                <p>The shorter-woolled kinds, and such as, from their size and form, seem well
                    suited to hilly and inferior pastures, are also numerous. Generally speaking,
                    they are too restless for inclosed arable land on the one hand, and not
                    sufficiently hardy for heathy, mountainous districts on the other. To this class
                    belong the breeds of <hi rend="italic">Dorset, Hereford, Sussex, Norfolk,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Cheviot.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dorsetshire</hi> sheep are mostly horned, white-faced,
                    Stand upon high, small, white legs, and are long and thin in the carcass. The
                    wethers, three years and a half old, weigh from 16 to 20 lb. a quarter. ∣The
                    wool is fine and short, from 3 to 4 lb. a fleece. The mutton is fine-grained and
                    well flavoured.</p>
                <p>This breed has the peculiar property of producing lambs at almost any period of
                    the year, even so early as September and October. They are particularly valued
                    for supplying London and other great towns with house-lämb, which is brought to
                    market by Christmas, or sooner if wanted; and after that a constant and regular
                    supply is kept up all the winter.</p>
                <p>According to Mr Culley, the <hi rend="italic">Wiltshire</hi> sheep are a variety
                    of this breed, which, by attention to size, have got considerably more weight,
                    viz. from 20 to 28 lb. a quarter. These, in general, have no wool upon their
                    bellies, which gives them a very uncouth appearance.</p>
                <p>“The variations of this breed are spread through many of the southern counties,
                    as well as many in the west, viz. Gloucestershire, Worcestershire,
                    Herefordshire, &amp;c. Though some of them are very different from the
                    Dorsetshire, yet they are, I apprehend, only variations of this breed, by
                    crossing with different tups; and which variations continue northward until they
                    are lost amongst those of the Lincolnshire breed.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Herefordshire</hi> sheep are known by their want of horns,
                    and their having white legs and faces, the wool growing close to their eyes. The
                    carcass is tolerably well formed, weighing from 10 to 18 lb. a quarter, and
                    bearing very fine short wool, from l½ to 2½ lb. a fleece: the mutton is
                    excellent.</p>
                <p>The store or keeping sheep of this breed are put into cots at night, winter and
                    summer, and in winter foddered in racks with peas-straw, barley-straw, &amp;c.
                    and in very bad weather with hay. These cots are low buildings, quite covered
                    over, and made to contain from 100 to 500 sheep, according to the size of the
                    farm or flock kept. The true Herefordshire breed are frequently called <hi
                    rend="italic">Fyeland</hi> sheep, from the land formerly being thought capable
                    of producing no bettet grain than rye, but which now yields every kind of grain.
                    See Plate XVI.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">South Down</hi> sheep are without horns; they have grey
                    faces and legs, fine bones, long small necks; are low before, high on the
                    shoulder, and light in the fore quarter; the sides are good, and the loin
                    tolerably broad, backbone too high, the thigh full, and twist good. The fleece
                    is very short and fine, weighing from 2½ to 3 lb. The average weight of two-year
                    old wethers is about 18 lb. per quarter, the mutton fine in the grain, and of an
                    excellent flavour. These sheep have been brought to a high state of improvement
                    by Mr Elman of Glynd, and other intelligent breeders. They prevail in Sussex, on
                    very dry chalky downs producing shortfine herbage. See Plate XVI.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Norfolk</hi> sheep the face is black, horns large and
                    spiral; the carcass is very small, long, thin, and weak, with narrow chines,
                    weighing from 16 to 20 lb. per quarter; and they'have very long dark or grey
                    legs, and large bones. The wool is short and fine, from 1∣ to 2 lb. per
                    fleece.</p>
                <p>This race have a voracious appetite, and a restless and unquiet disposition,
                    which makes it difficult to keep them in any other than the largest sheep-walks
                    or commons. They prevail most in Norfolk and Suffolk, and seem to have been
                    retained solely for the purpose of folding; as it does not appear they have any
                    other good property to recommend them besides being good travellers, for which
                    they seem well adapted, from their very long legs and light lean carcasses.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cheviot</hi> breed are without horns, the head bare and
                    clean, with jaws of a good length, faces and legs white. See Plate XIV. The body
                    is long, but the fore quarters generally want depth in the breast, and breadth
                    both there and on the chine, though in these respects great improvement has been
                    made of late. They have fine, clean, smallboned legs, well covered with wool to
                    the hough. The weight of their carcass, when fat, is from 12 to 18 lb. per
                    quarter; their fleece, which is of a medium length and fineness, weighs about 3
                    lb. on an average.</p>
                <p>Though these are the general characters of the pure Cheviot breed, many have grey
                    or dun spots on their faces and legs, especially on the borders of their native
                    district, where they have intermixed with their black-faced neighbours. On the
                    lower hills, at the extremity of the Cheviot range, they have been frequently
                    crossed with the Leicesters, of which several flocks, originally Cheviot, have
                    now a good deal both of the form and fleece.</p>
                <p>The best kind of these sheep are certainly a very good mountain stock, where the
                    pasture is mostly green sward, or contains a large portion of that kind of
                    herbage, which is the case with all the hills around Cheviot where those sheep
                    are bred. Large flocks of them have been sent to the Highlands of Scotland,
                    where they have succeeded so well as to encourage the establishment of new
                    colonies; yet they are by no means so hardy as the heath or blackfaced kind,
                    which they have in many instances supplanted.</p>
                <p>Of those races of sheep that range over the mountainous districts of Britain, the
                    most numerous, and the one probably best adapted to such situations, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Heath</hi> breed, distinguished by its large spiral horns, black
                    faces and legs, fierce, wild-looking eyes, and short, firm carcasses covered
                    with long, open, coarse wool. Their weight is from 10 to 16 lb. a quarter, and
                    they carry from 3 to 4 lb. of wool each. They are seldom fed until they are
                    three, four, or five years old, when they fatten well, and give excellent mutton
                    and highly flavoured gravy. Different varieties of these sheep are to be found
                    in all the western counties of England and Scotland, from Yorkshire northwards;
                    and they want nothing but a finer fleece to render them the most valuable upland
                    sheep in Britain. See Plate XV.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hcrdwick</hi> sheep are peculiar to that rocky, mountainous
                    district, at the head of the Duddon and Esk rivers, in the county of Cumberland.
                    They are without horns, have speckled faces and legs, wool short, weighing from
                    2 to 2½ lb. per sheep, which, though coarser than that of any of the other
                    short-woolled breeds, is yet much finer than the wool of the heath sheep. The
                    mountains upon which the Herdwicks are bred, and also the stock itself, have,
                    time immemorial, been farmed out to herds,· and from this circumstance their
                    name is derived.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dun-faced</hi> breed, said to have been imported into
                    Scotland from Denmark or Norway at a very early period, still exists in most of
                    the counties to the north of the Frith of Forth, though only in very small
                    flocks: Of this ancient race there are now several varieties, produced by
                    peculiarities of situation and different modes of management, and by occasional
                    intermixture with other breeds. We may therefore distinguish the sheep of the
                    mainland of Scotland from those of the Hebrides and of the northern islands of
                    Orkney and Zetland.</p>
                <p>“The Hebridean sheep is the smallest animal of its kind. It is of a thin, lank
                    shape, and has usually straight, short horns. The face and legs are white, the
                    tail very short, and the wool of various colours, sometimes of a bluish grey,
                    brown, or deep russet, and sometimes all these colours meet in the fleece of one
                    animal. Where the pasture and management are favourable, the wool is very fine,
                    resembling in softness that of Shetland; but in other parts of the same islands
                    the wool is stunted and coarse, the animal sickly and puny, and frequently
                    carries four, or even six horns.”</p>
                <p>“The average weight of this poor breed, even when fat, is only 5 or 5½ lb. per
                    quarter, or nearly about 20 lb. per sheep. It is often much less, only amounting
                    to 15 or 16 lb.; and the price of the animal’s carcass, skin and all, is from
                    10s. to 14s. We have seen fat wedders sold in the Long Island at 7s. a head, and
                    ewes at 5s. or 6s. The quantity of wool which the fleece yields is equally
                    contemptible with the weight of the carcass. It rarely exceeds 1 lb. weight, and
                    is often short of even half that quantity. The quality of the wool is different
                    on different parts of the body; and inattention to separating the fine from the
                    coarse renders the cloth made in the Hebrides very unequal and precarious in its
                    texture. The average value of a fleece of this aboriginal Hebridean breed is
                    from 8d. to Is. sterling. From this account it is plain that the breed in
                    question has every chance of being speedily extirpated.” (Macdonald’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Report of the Hebrides,</hi> p. 447.)</p>
                <p>In the Zetland Isles it would appear that there arc two varieties; one of which
                    is considered to be the native race, and carries very fine wool; but the number
                    of these is much diminished, and in some places they have been entirely
                    supplanted by foreign breeds. The other variety, carries coarse wool above, and
                    soft, fine wool below. “They have three different successions of wool yearly,
                    two of which resemble long hair more than wool, and are termed by the common
                    people <hi rend="italic">fors</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scudda.</hi> When the
                    wool begins to loosen in the roots, which generally happens about the month of
                    February, the hairs or <hi rend="italic">scudda</hi> spring up; and when the
                    wool is carefully plucked off, the tough hairs continue fast, until the new wool
                    grows up about a quarter of an inch in length, when they gradually wear off; and
                    when the new fleece has acquired about two months’ growth, the rough hairs,
                    termed <hi rend="italic">fors,</hi> spring up, and keep root, until the proper
                    season for pulling it arrives, when it is plucked off along with the wool, and
                    separated from it at dressing the fleece, by an operation called <hi
                    rend="italic">forsing.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">scudda</hi> remains upon the
                    skin of the animal, as if it were a. thick coat; a fence against the inclemency
                    of the seasons, which provident nature has furnished for supplying the want of
                    the fleece.</p>
                <p>“The wool is of various colours. The silver grey is thought to be the finest; but
                    the black, the white, the <hi rend="italic">mowrat</hi> or brown, is very little
                    inferior; though the pure white is certainly the most valuable for all the finer
                    purposes in which combing wool can be used.” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>In the northern part of Kincardineshire, as well as in most other of the northern
                    counties, there is still a remnant of this ancient race, distinguished by the
                    yellow colour of the face and legs, and by the dishevelled texture of the
                    fleece, which consists in part of coarse, and in part of remarkably fine wool.
                    Their average weight in that county is from 7 .to 9 lb. a quarter, and the
                    mutton is remarkably delicate and highly, flavoured. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Kincardineshire Report,</hi> p. 385.)</p>
                <p>The last variety we shall mention is the Spanish or <hi rend="italic">Merino</hi>
                    breed, bearing the. finest wool of the sheep species. The males usually have
                    horns of a middle size, but the females are frequently without horns; the faces
                    and legs are white, the legs rather long, but the bones fine. The average weight
                    per quarter of a tolerably fat ram is about 17 lb., and that of ewes about 11
                    lb. The shape of this race is far from being perfect,- according to the ideas of
                    English breeders, with whom symmetry of proportion constitutes a principal
                    criterion of excellence. The <hi rend="italic">throatiness,</hi> or pendulous
                    skin beneath the throat, which is usually accompanied with a sinking or hollow
                    in the neck, presents a most offensive appearance, though it is much esteemed in
                    Spain, as denoting both a tendency to fine wool and a heavy fleece. Yet the
                    Spanish sheep are level on the back and behind the shoulders; and Lord
                    Somerville has proved, that there is no reason to conclude that deformity in
                    shape is in any degree necessary to the production of fine wool.</p>
                <p>The fleece of the Merino sheep weighs upon an average from 3 to 5 lb. In colour
                    it is unlike that of any English breed. There is on the surface of the best
                    Spanish fleeces a dark brown tinge, approaching, almost to a black, which is
                    formed by dust adhering to the greasy properties of its pile; and the contrast
                    between this tinge and the rich white colour below, as well as that rosy hue of
                    the skin which denotes high proof, at first sight excites much surprise. The
                    harder the fleece is, the more it resists any external pressure of the hand, the
                    more close and fine will be the wool. Here and there indeed a fine pile may be
                    found in an open fleece, though this occurs but rarely. Nothing, however, has
                    tended to render the Merino sheep more unsightly to the English eye than the
                    large tuft of wool which covers the head: it is of a very inferior quality, and
                    classes with what is produced on the hind legs; on which account it does not
                    sort with any of the three qualities, viz. <hi rend="italic">Rejinos</hi> or
                    prime, <hi rend="italic">Finos</hi> or second best, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Terceros,</hi> the inferior sort, and consequently is never exported from
                    Spain.</p>
                <p>The Spanish flocks which yield fine wool are sometimes distinguished by the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">Trashurnante,</hi> on account of their
                    travelling from one end of the kingdom to the other, though there are flocks
                    that never travel, with wool equally fine. They are wintered in Estremadura <hi

                    &amp;c—Appendix, No. 4. (Account of the Shetland Sheep, by Thomas Johnston, <pb

                    provinces in the south; and during the summer months they graze on the northern
                    mountains of Castile, Leon, and Asturias.</p>
                <p>Merinos were first brought into England in 1788, but did not excite much interest
                    before his Majesty’s sales, which began in 1804. The desirable object of
                    spreading them widely over the country, and subjecting them to the experiments
                    of the most eminent professional breeders, was greatly promoted by the
                    institution of the Merino Society in 1811; which soon comprehended some of the
                    greatest landholders and the most eminent breeders in die kingdom. See Plate
                    XVII.</p>
                <p>It seems to be generally admitted, however, that the wool is somewhat
                    deteriorated since the sheep were brought to this country, whatever improvement
                    inay have been made on the carcass. Valuable as the fleece is, our breeders
                    still find that the carcass is the principal object; and their management must
                    therefore be conducted rather with a view to the supply of the butcher than the
                    clothier. There may be something in our climate unfavourable to the growth of
                    fine wool; but the principal cause will probably be found in the mode of
                    feeding, which is in every respect so superior to what they experience in Spain
                    and other parts of the Continent. As a means of improving the wool of our own
                    breeds, it may often be beneficial to cross with the Merinos; but as a separate
                    and distinct race, it is hardly to be expected that they will ever establish
                    themselves upon an extensive scale in this country.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Ereeding and Rearing.</hi></p>
                <p>A greater degree of perfection has been attained in the breeding of sheep than in
                    any other species of live stock; and in this branch, in particular, the breeders
                    of England stand higher than those of any other country.</p>
                <p>We have therefore purposely deferred the observations which it seems necessary to
                    offer on the different systems of breeding, to this part of our article; though
                    they may apply generally to other species of animals as well as to sheep.</p>
                <p>The males and females possessed of the properties the breeder wishes to acquire,
                    may be, 1. of the same family; 2. of the same race, but of different families;
                    or, 3. of different races.</p>
                <p>The first method is called <hi rend="italic">breeding in-and-in.</hi> This
                    requires that animals of the nearest relationship should be put together, and is
                    supposed by many to produce a tender, diminutive, and unhealthy progeny. But if
                    a male and female, got by the same sire, were never to be put together, however
                    excellent they might be, a stock that should by any means have become better
                    than others could not belong preserved from deterioration by strangers, nor
                    could it be still further improved by selection. By breeding in the same family
                    for a great many years, Mr Bakeweĭl succeeded in raising his sheep to a degree
                    of perfection which no other fattening animal ever attained in any age or
                    country.</p>
                <p>“It is certainly,” says Mr Culley, one of the most eminent of his disciples,
                    “from the <hi rend="italic">best males and females</hi> that the <hi
                    rend="italic">best breeds</hi> can be obtained or preserved.”—“When you can no
                    longer find <hi rend="italic">better males</hi> than your own, then by all means
                    breed from them, whether horses, neat-cattle, sheep, &amp;c.; for the same rule
                    holds good through every species of domestic animals; but upon no account
                    attempt to breed or cross from worse than your own; for that would be acting in
                    contradiction to common sense, experience, and that well-established rule, ‘ <hi
                    rend="italic">That best only can beget best,'</hi> or, which is a particular
                    case of a more general rule, viz. ‘ <hi rend="italic">That like begets
                    like.'"</hi></p>
                <p>This reasoning is opposed by others, who, however, rather deny the premises than
                    dispute the conclusion. It has been contended that there never “did exist an
                    animal without some defect in constitution, in form, or in some other essential
                    quality ;” that “this defect, however small it may be at first, will increase in
                    every succeeding generation, and at last predominate to such a degree as to
                    render the breed of little value.”—“Mr Bakewell very properly considered a
                    propensity to get fat as the first quality in an animal destined to be the food
                    of man. His successors have carried his principle too far; their stock are
                    become small in size, and tender, produce little wool, and are bad breeders.”

                <p>It is admitted, however, that <hi rend="italic">breeding in-and-in</hi> will have
                    the same effect in strengthening the good as the bad properties, and may be
                    beneficial if not carried too far, particularly in fixing any variety that may
                    be thought valuable. And again, the same writer observes, “There may be families
                    so nearly perfect as to go through several generations without sustaining much
                    injury from having been bred <hi rend="italic">in-and-in;</hi> but a good judge
                    would upon examination point out by what they must ultimately fail, as a
                    mechanic could discover the weakest part of a machine before it gave way.”
                    (Sebright <hi rend="italic">on improving the Ereeds of Domestic Animals,</hi> p.
                    12.)</p>
                <p>“But one of the most conclusive arguments that crossing with a different stock is
                    not necessary to secure size, hardiness, &amp;c., is the breed of wild cattle in
                    Chillingham park, in the county of Northumberland. It is well known these cattle
                    have been confined in this park for several hundred years, without any
                    intermixture, and are perhaps the <hi rend="italic">purest breed</hi> of cattle
                    of any in the kingdom. From their situation and uncontrolled state, they must
                    indisputably have bred from the nearest affinities in every possible degree; yet
                    we find these cattle exceedingly hardy, healthy, and well formed, and their
                    size, as well as colour, and many other particulars and peculiarities, the same
                    as they were five hundred years since.” (Culley <hi rend="italic">on Live
                    Stock,</hi> p. 10.)</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding all this, it must be admitted that there is a great diversity of
                    opinion among intelligent men respecting the expediency of this mode of
                    breeding, and in most instances, perhaps, a pretty strong prejudice against it.
                    The most common practice therefore is, to breed from different families of the
                    same race. When these have been for some time established in a variety of
                    situations, and have had some slight shades of difference impressed upon them by
                    the influence of different soils and treatment, it is found advantageous to
                    interchange the males, for the purpose of strengthening the excellencies or
                    remedying the defects of each family. Of this advantage Mr Bakewell could not
                    avail himself; but it has been very generally attended to by his successors. Mr
                    Culley for many years continued to hire his rams from Mr Bakewell, at the very
                    time that other breeders were paying a liberal price for the use of his own; and
                    the very same practice is followed by the most skilful breeders at present. In
                    large concerns, two or more <hi rend="italic">streams</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                    >blood</hi> may be kept distinct for several generations, and occasionally
                    intermixed with the happiest effects, by a judicious breeder, without having
                    recourse to other flocks.</p>
                <p>The only other method is, by crossing two distinct breeds or races, one of which
                    possesses the properties which it is wished to acquire, or is free from the
                    defects which it is desirable to remove. This measure can only be recommended
                    when neither of the former methods will answer the purpose. The very distinction
                    of breeds implies a considerable difference among animals in several<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193034125" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4125-0332"/> respects; and
                    although the desirable property be obtained, it may be accompanied by such
                    others as arc by no means advantageous to a race destined to occupy a situation
                    which had excluded that property from one of its parents. To cross any mountain
                    breed with Leicester rams, for example, with a view to obtain a propensity to
                    fatten at an early age, would be attended with an enlargement of size, which the
                    mountain pasture could not support; and the progeny would be a mongrel race, not
                    suited to the pastures of either of the parent breeds. If the object be to
                    obtain an enlargement of size, as well as a propensity to fatten, as is the case
                    when Cheviot ewes are crossed with Leicester rams, the progeny will not prosper
                    on the hilly pastures of their dams, and will be equally unprofitable on the
                    better pastures of their sires. But the offspring of this cross succeeds well on
                    those intermediate situations on the skirts of the Cheviot hills, where, though
                    the summer pasture is not rich, there is a portion of low land for producing
                    clover and turnips.</p>
                <p>In every case where the enlargement of the carcass is the object, the cross breed
                    must be better fed than its smaller parent. The size of the parents should also
                    be but little disproportioned at first; and when some increase has been
                    produced, one or more crosses afterwards may raise the breed to the required
                    size. With these precautions, there is little reason to fear disappointment,
                    provided both parents are well formed. <hi rend="italic">(General Report of
                    Scotland,</hi> vol. iii. p. 14—18.)</p>
                <p>The breeding of males, still more in this species than in cattle, has long been a
                    separate pursuit; and there are few flocks skilfully managed in which it is not
                    still the practice to have recourse occasionally to rams hired at a high price
                    from those men whose chief attention is devoted to this branch of business.
                    These rams are shown for hire, at certain times and places during the summer,
                    where every one may select such as promise to maintain or improve the particular
                    state of his flock, and at such prices as his means and experience may justify.
                    Two or more individuals frequently join together in the hire of one ram, to
                    which they put the best of their ewes, for the purpose of obtaining superior
                    males for the future service of the rest of their flocks; and in particular
                    cases, when the owner of the ram does not choose to part with him, even for a
                    season, ewes are sent to him to be covered at a certain price per head, superior
                    animals of this class being very seldom sold altogether. Mueh as this mode of
                    doing business has been reprobated as a monopoly, and much as there may
                    sometimes be of deception in <hi rend="italic">making up</hi> rams for these
                    shows, all intelligent practical men must agree that there can be no better
                    method of remunerating eminent breeders, and of spreading their improvements
                    most widely, in the shortest period, and at the least possible expense. A single
                    ram thus communicates its valuable properties to a number of flocks, often in
                    distant parts of the country, without distracting the attention of ordinary
                    breeders from their other pursuits. It is a striking instance of the division of
                    labour, which in this, as in other branches, has been productive of the most
                    beneficial results to all concerned, and to the community at large.</p>
                <p>Rams and ewes are allowed to copulate earlier or later, according to the prospect
                    of food for their young at the period of parturition,—usually in October and the
                    early part of November; and as the time of gestation with sheep is twenty-one
                    weeks, the lambs are accordingly dropped in March or April. The management of
                    the Leicester breed, equally applicable to all the varieties kept on low arable
                    land, having been detailed at some length in the works already referred to, we
                    shall here give a condensed view of the best practices in regard to the stocks
                    of hilly or mountainous districts, chiefly collected from the skilful management
                    of the breeders of the Cheviot sheep on the borders of South and North
                    Britain.</p>
                <p>1. In November the rams are put to the ewes, a little earlier or later, according
                    to the prospcet of spring food, but seldom before the 8th or 10th of that month.
                    The number of rams required is greater or less, according to the extent of the
                    pasture, and their own age and condition. If the ewes are not spread over an
                    extensive tract, one ram to sixty ewes is generally sufficient. It is usually
                    thought advisable to separate the gimmers (sheep once shorn) from the older
                    ewes, and to send the rams to the latter eight or ten days before they are
                    admitted to the former. Notwithstanding this precaution, which retards their
                    lambing season till the spring is farther advanced, ewes which bring their first
                    lamb when two years old, the common period on the best hill farms, are often
                    very bad nurses, and in a late spring lose a great many of their lambs, unless
                    they are. put into good condition with turnip before lambing, and get early
                    grass afterwards. This separation, and difference in the time of admitting the
                    rams to the ewes and gimmers, should therefore be always attended to.</p>
                <p>2. When a farm under this description of stock has the convenience of a few good
                    inclosures, still more minute attention is paid by skilful managers. It is not
                    sufficient that the rams arc carefully selected from perhaps double the number;
                    the ewes also are drawn out and assorted, and such a ram appropriated to each
                    lot as possesses the properties in form or fleece in which the ewes are
                    deficient. In other cases, the best ram and the best lot of ewes are put
                    together. When neither of these arrangements can be adopted, owing to the want
                    of inclosures, it is the practice to send the best rams to the ewes for a few
                    days at first, and those of an inferior description afterwards. In every case,
                    when the farmer employs rams of his own flock, he is careful to have a few of
                    his best ewes covered by a well-formed and fine-woolled ram, for the purpose of
                    obtaining a number of good ram-lambs, for preserving or improving the character
                    of his stock.</p>
                <p>3. The stock through winter, in a mere breeding farm, consists of ewes and
                    gimmers which should have lambs in spring, ewe-lambs or hogs, and a few young
                    and old rams. All these are sometimes allowed to pasture promiscuously, but on
                    the farms around Cheviot the ewes and ewe-hogs are kept separate, and the latter
                    are either put on rough pastures which have been lightly stocked in the latter
                    end of summer, or get a few turnips once a day, in addition to the femains of
                    their summer pasture. The most effectual preventive of the desolating distempers
                    to which sheep of this age are liable is turnips; and though they should never
                    taste them afterwards, a small quantity is frequently given them during their
                    first winter. After the rams have been separated from the ewes, they are usually
                    indulged with the same feeding as the hogs.</p>
                <p>4. The ewes, during winter, are seldom allowed any other food than what their
                    summer pasture affords, except that a small part of it may sometimes be but
                    lightly eaten, and reserved as a resource against severe storms. When these
                    occur, however, as they often do in the Cheviot district, there is little
                    dependence on any other food than hay. When the snow is so deep as completely to
                    cover the herbage, about two stones avoirdupois of hay are allowed to a score of
                    sheep daily, and it is laid down morning and evening in small parcels on any
                    sheltered spot near the houses, or under the shelter of <hi rend="italic"
                    >stells</hi> or clumps of trees, on different parts of the farm.</p>
                <p>5. In March, the ewes, at least the gimmers or young <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193034138" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4138-0333"/>ewes, are commonly allowed a
                    few turnips once a day, on farms on which there is any extent of arable land,
                    which are either carted to their pastures, or eaten on the ground by bringing
                    the sheep to the turnip-field through the night. A part of the field, in the
                    latter case, is cut off by nets or by hurdles, which inclose the sheep in the
                    same way as if they were intended for fattening. When they are ready to drop
                    their lambs, they are no longer kept on the turnip-field, but get what turnips
                    maybe left, on their pastures. It is seldom, however, that the turnips last so
                    long, though it is desirable to have a few remaining, to be given to the weakest
                    ewes, or to such as have twins, in a separate inclosure.</p>
                <p>6. A few days before the time of lambing, the ewes are collected for the purpose
                    of being <hi rend="italic">udder-locked.</hi> The sheep are raised upon their
                    buttocks, their backs next to the operator, who then bends forward and plucks
                    off the <hi rend="italic">locks</hi> of wool growing on or near the udders, for
                    the purpose of giving free access to the expected lambs. At the same time he
                    ascertains the condition of the ewes, and marks such as do not appear to be in
                    lamb, which may then be separated from the others. This operation is not without
                    danger, and several premature births are usually the consequence. It is
                    therefore not so general a practice as it was formerly, though still a common
                    one on many, if not on most farms.</p>
                <p>7. On those farms where the hogs have been allowed to pasture promiscuously with
                    the ewes, which is seldom permitted on the Cheviot hills, a separation should
                    always take place at the commencement of the lambing season; and the lowest and
                    finest part of the pasture ought to be exclusively appropriated to the nursing
                    ewes.</p>
                <p>8. The ewes begin to drop their lambs in the first or second week of April,
                    according to the time at which the rams were admitted; and such as have twins
                    generally lamb among the first of the flock. At this season the most constant
                    attention is indispensable on the part of the shepherds, both to the ewes in
                    labour and to the newly dropped lambs. Though the Cheviot ewes are not so liable
                    to losses in parturition as some larger breeds which are in higher condition,
                    and though they make good nurses, unless they are very lean, and their food
                    scanty, yet among a large flock there are always a number that need assistance
                    in lambing, and in a late spring not a few that have not milk sufficient for
                    their lambs, particularly among the gimmers or young ewes. A careful shepherd at
                    this time always carries a bottle of milk along with him, which he drops from
                    his own mouth into that of the lamb that may need it,—brings the ewes that have
                    little milk to a better pasture, or to turnips,—and confines such as have
                    forsaken their lambs in a small pen, or <hi rend="italic">barrack</hi> as it is
                    called, temporarily erected in some part of the farm-steading. The same
                    confinement is necessary when it is wished to make a ewe that has lost her own
                    lamb nurse that of another ewe that has had twins, or that has perished in
                    lambing, or is from any other cause incapable of rearing her lamb. The ewe,
                    after being shut up for a few hours with the stranger lamb, usually admits it to
                    the teat, and ever after treats it as her own; though sometimes a little
                    deception is necessary, such as covering the stranger with the skin of her own
                    lamb, At this important season, an inclosure of rich early grass, near the
                    shepherd’s cottage, is of vast advantage. Thither he carries the ewes and
                    twins,—such as have little milk,—those that have been induced to adopt another’s
                    offspring,—and, generally, all that need to be frequently inspected, and are in
                    want of better treatment than the rest of the flock.</p>
                <p>9. As soon as the weather is favourable, after a considerable number of the ewes
                    have lambed, they are collected into a fold, and all the male lambs are
                    castrated, except a few of the best, reserved for rams. The ewe-lambs are never
                    spayed. It is advisable to perform this severe but necessary operation when the
                    lambs are but a few days old, if the weather will permit, instead of delaying
                    till the end of the lambing season, as is still the case in some instances.</p>
                <p>10. Towards the end of the lambing season the ewes that have not yet dropped
                    lambs are separated from the flock and kept by themselves, that they may be more
                    under the eye of the shepherd, than if scattered over all the pasture. It is
                    desirable to allow them finer grass for a few weeks after lambing, that their
                    lambs may come to be nearly equal to the rest of the flock when weaned; or, if
                    they are too late for this, that they may get ready for the butcher by the month
                    of August, beyond which period the ewes must be much injured by suckling
                    them.</p>
                <p>11. When the'wool has risen sufficiently (and the proper time is easily known by
                    the appearance of a new growth), the barren sheep are brought to the
                    washingpool. Sometimes they are hand-washed by men, who stand in the pool and
                    have the sheep forced towards them singly; but more commonly the Cheviot sheep,
                    especially if the flock be numerous, are compelled to leap into the pool in a
                    body for three or four times successively; and it is desirable that they should
                    have room to swim a little, and come out on a green low bank on the opposite
                    side. After being washed, the sheep are preserved as far as possible from
                    rubbing against earthen dikes or banks, and from lying down on any dirty spot
                    which might soil their wool. There are two methods of shearing; in the one, the
                    operator sits on the floor or on the ground, lays the sheep on its back between
                    his knees, begins with the belly, and afterwards, having tied the animal’s legs,
                    proceeds very expeditiously, at the rate of four or five sheep in the hour, or
                    from forty to fifty a day. This is the common method of shearing Cheviot sheep.
                    In the other, which is a much more perfect method, the shearer raises the animal
                    on its buttocks, and, beginning at the neck, clips in a circular direction from
                    the belly to the backbone, for some time with one hand, and then on the opposite
                    side with the other. The fleeces are neatly lapped up, after any filthy spots
                    have been cut off, the shorn side outwards, beginning at the breech-wool, and
                    using that of the neck and shoulders as a bandage. Before the shorn sheep are
                    turned out to pasture, they are marked, commonly with the owner’s initials, by a
                    stamp, or <hi rend="italic">boost</hi> in provincial language, dipped in tar
                    heated to a thin fluid state; and it is not unusual to place this mark on
                    different parts of the body, according to the sheep’s age.</p>
                <p>12. The principal markets for Cheviot lambs in the south of Scotland are held in
                    the month of July, the first on the fifth of July; so that the lambs may
                    commonly be weaned when about three months old, and sometimes sooner. When the
                    ewes are gathered to be washed or shorn, the ewe-lambs to be kept for supplying
                    the place of the old ewes, annually sold, are stamped in the same way as the
                    ewes. The store-lambs are sent to some clean grassy pasture for a few weeks; and
                    where the farm does not afford this accommodation, they must be <hi
                    rend="italic">summered,</hi> as it is called, at a distance. Several farms near
                    Cheviot, and on the Lammermuir hills in Berwickshire, are appropriated to this
                    purpose, the owner of the lambs paying so much a head for six or eight weeks. In
                    the mean time the ewe-hogs, or gimmers, as they are denominated after shearing,
                    have joined the ewe stock; and the lambs, when brought home, go to the pasture
                    which they had occupied. Wherever they may be kept in winter, it is always
                    desirable to allow them a few turnips, along with a full bite of coarse
                    herbage.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034151" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4151-0334"/>
                <p>13. When the lambs had been separated from the ewes, it was formerly the practice
                    to milk the ewes for six or eight weeks or more; and this most objectionable
                    management is still continued by several farmers. The most skilful
                    store-masters, however, have either laid aside milking, unless for a few days,
                    or have shortened the period to two or three weeks. The value of the milk for
                    eight weeks will not exceed from one shilling to one shilling and sixpence a
                    head, and the sheep are injured to at least three times that amount, independent
                    of accidents at the milking fold. The cream is separated from the ewe-milk, and
                    made into butter for smearing, and the milk itself mixed with cow-milk, and
                    converted into cheese.</p>
                <p>14. The next object of attention is the drafting of the old ewes to be sold in
                    September or October. Their age, on the Lower hills, is usually four years and a
                    half, or they are disposed of after having reared lambs for three years. In some
                    situations they are kept on till a year older; but when they are purchased, as
                    they usually are, to be kept another year on lower grounds, it is commonly for
                    the interest of the store-farmer to sell them when still in their full vigour.
                    Skilful managers do not content themselves with drafting them merely according
                    to age; and as there is no disadvantage in keeping a few of the best another
                    year, they take this opportunity of getting rid of such of the flock of other
                    ages as are not of good shapes, or are otherwise objectionable. As soon as the
                    ewes to be disposed of are drawn from the flock, they are kept by themselves on
                    better pasture, if the circumstances of the farm will admit of it. Sometimes
                    they are carried on till they are fattened, and turnips are often purchased for
                    them at a distance. When this is the case, it is not thought advisable to keep
                    them longer than till between Christmas and Candlemas, as an old ewe does not
                    improve like a wether in the spring months.</p>
                <p>15. The last operation of the season is salving or smearing, which is usually
                    performed towards the end of October or beginning of November, before the rams
                    are sent to the ewes. The most common materials are butter and tar, mixed in
                    different proportions; a greater proportion of tar being employed for the hogs
                    or young sheep than for the older ones. The butter is slowly melted and poured
                    upon the tar, and the mixture is constantly stirred till it becomes cool enough
                    for use. The wool is accurately parted into rows from the head to thie tail of
                    the animal, and the salve is carefully spread upon the skin with the point of
                    the finger, at the bottom of each row. The object of this operation is to
                    destroy vermin, to prevent cutaneous diseases, and to promote the warmth and
                    comfort of the animal during the storms of the ensuing winter. It is not
                    necessary with sheep kept on low grounds, and well fed during winter; and it may
                    be occasionally omitted for one season, particularly with old sheep, without
                    material injury; but notwithstanding the ridicule that speculative writers have
                    attempted to throw upon the practice, it is almost universally considered
                    necessary and beneficial, on high exposed situations, by the store-farmers of
                    the border hills. (<hi rend="italic">General Report of Scotland,</hi> vol. iii.)
                    Inconsequence of the great depression of late in the price of tarred wool,
                    however, various attempts have been made to use in its stead other mixtures,
                    which are laid on the sheep either in a liquid form, such as tobacco liquor and
                    turpentine, or of the consistency of a salve, which is composed of oil and
                    butter or tallow, with a mixture of turpentine. There has not been sufficient
                    experience to ascertain whether tar can be altogether dispensed with in the case
                    of the mountain flocks; but in general it is now used much more sparingly than
                    formerly.</p>
                <p>Besides those general rules of management which are applicable, with slight
                    modifications, to all the numerous breeds of sheep, there are practices more or
                    less extensively followed in particular districts, or with particular breeds,
                    the most important of which are <hi rend="italic">cotting</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">folding.</hi> In describing the Herefordshire sheep, the practice
                    of keeping them in cots through the night has been already noticed; and a
                    similar one is followed in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland with the
                    small dun-faced flocks of that district.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Folding</hi> is adopted as a regular part of the system of
                    management in several counties of England, for the purpose of turning the dung
                    of the animals to the best account in promoting the fertility of their arable
                    land. The same thing has been done to a small extent in Scotland, but it forms
                    no part of general management there, and is confined to those situations where,
                    from the want of inclosures, it is necessary to the protection of the crops, and
                    to small patches of what is still in the ancient state of <hi rend="italic"
                    >outfield,</hi> as a preparation for corn.</p>
                <p>The sheep best adapted to the fold are those of the more active short-woolled
                    varieties, such as the Norfolk, Wiltshire, and South Down breeds; the heavy
                    long-woolled kinds being less hardy, and some of them, as the Leicesters, much
                    too valuable for a mode of treatment that converts them into dung carriers. The
                    following calculation will show, that though in open lands the practice may be
                    in some cases tolerated on the ground of conveniency or expediency, it can
                    possess no recommendation as a profitable mode of management in other
                    circumstances; and the best farmers, indeed, from Bakewell, who used to say that
                    it was robbing Peter to pay Paul, down to the present time, agree in reprobating
                    sheep-folding as a branch of general management.</p>
                <p>“This morning (September 22d, 1780) measured a sheep-fold set out for 600 sheep,
                    consisting of ewes, wedders, and grown lambs. It measures 8 by 5½ rods, which is
                    somewhat more than 7 rods to 100, or 2 yards to a sheep.”</p>
                <p>“August 29, 1781. Last autumn made an accurate experiment, on a large scale, with
                    different manures for wheat, on a sandy loam, summer-fallowed.</p>
                <p>“Part of an 18 acre piece was manured with 15 or 16 loads of tolerably good
                    farm-yard dung an acre, part with three chaldrons of lime an acre; the rest
                    folded upon with sheep twice; the first time at the rate of 600 sheep to a
                    quarter of an acre (as in first Minute), the second time thinner.</p>
                <p>“In winter and spring the dung kept the lead; and now, at harvest, it has
                    produced the greatest burden of straw.</p>
                <p>“The sheep-fold kept a steady pace from seedtime to harvest, and is now evidently
                    the best corned and the cleanest crop.</p>
                <p>“The lime, in winter and spring, made a poor appearance; but after some showers
                    in summer, it flourished much, and is now a tolerable crop, not less, I
                    apprehend, than three quarters an acre.</p>
                <p>“From these data, the value of a sheep-fold, <hi rend="italic">in this ease,</hi>
                    may be calculated.</p>
                <p>“It appears from the first Minute that 100 sheep manured seven square rods daily.
                    But the second folding was thinner,—suppose nine rods; this is, on a par of the
                    two foldings, eight rods a day each folding.</p>
                <p>“The dung could not be worth less than half-a-crown a load, and the carriage and
                    spreading ten shillings an acre; together, fifty shillings an acre; which
                    quantity of land the hundred sheep teathed twice over in forty days.</p>
                <p>“Supposing them to be folded the year round, they would at this rate fold nine
                    acres annually; which, at 50s. an acre, is L.22. 10s. a hundred, or 4s. 6d. a
                    head.</p>
                <p>“In some parts of the island the same quantity of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193034164" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4164-0335"/>dung would be worth L.5 an
                    acre, which would raise the value of the teathe to nine shillings a head; which,
                    at twopence a head a week, is more than the whole year’s keep of the sheep.</p>
                <p>“It does not follow, however, that all lands would have received equal benefit
                    with the piece in consideration, which perhaps had not been folded upon for many
                    years, perhaps never before; and sheep-fold, like other manures, may become less
                    efficacious the longer it is used on a given piece of land.” (Marshall’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Rural Economy of Norfolk,</hi> vol. ii. p. 29.)</p>
                <p>It must readily occur, that to fold on land in tillage all the year is nearly
                    impracticable; and that where it could be done, the manure would be greatly
                    diminished in value from rain and snow, to say nothing of The injury to the
                    sheep themselves; so that the estimate of four shillings and sixpence, or nine
                    shillings a head, is evidently in the extreme.</p>
                <p>According to the experience of Mr Arthur Young <hi rend="italic">{Farmers
                    Kalendar),</hi> the same land will maintain one-fourth more stock when the
                    animals are allowed to depasture at liberty, than when confined during the night
                    in folds. The injury to the stock themselves, though it is not easy to mention
                    its precise amount with any degree of accuracy, cannot well be doubted, at least
                    in the ease of the larger and less active breeds, when it is considered that
                    they are driven twice a day, sometimes for a distance of two or even three
                    miles, and that their hours of feeding and rest are in a great measure
                    controlled by the shepherd and his boy. “When they are kept in numerous parcels,
                    it is not only driving to and from the fold that affects them, but they are in
                    faet driving about in a sort of march all day long, when the strongest have too
                    great an advantage, and the flock divides into the head and tail of it, by which
                    means one part of them must trample the food to be eaten by another. All this
                    proves the very reverse of their remaining perfectly quiet in small parcels.”
                    Another writer observes, that “were the pasture sheep of Lincolnshire to be got
                    into a fold once a week, and only caught one by one and put out again
                    immediately,, it would prevent their becoming fat.” (Parkinson <hi rend="italic"
                    >on Live Stock,</hi> vol. i. p. 367.) The only sort of folding ever adopted to
                    any extent by the best breeders is on turnips, clovers, tares, and other rich
                    food, where the sheep feed at their ease, and manure the land at the same
                    time.</p>
                <p>Another mode of management somewhat akin to this practice, and which is similar
                    to one that has been warmly recommended in a recent publication (Sir J.
                    Sinclair’s <hi rend="italic">Husbandry of Scotland),</hi> as if it had been
                    formerly unknown, is described and commented on by Mr Young as follows :—“This
                    practice is, to confine them at night in a sheep-yard, well and regularly
                    littered with straw, stubble," and fern; by which means you keep your flock warm
                    and healthy in bad seasons, and at the same time raise a surprising quantity of
                    dung,—so great a quantity, if you have plenty of litter, that the profit will be
                    better than folding on the land. A great improvement in this method would be,
                    giving the sheep all their food (except their pasture) in such yard, viz. hay
                    and turnips, for which purpose they may be brought up not only at night,' but
                    also at noon, to be baited; but if their pasture be at a distance, they should
                    then, instead of baiting at noon, come to the yard earlier in die evening, and
                    go out later in the morning. This is a practice that cannot be too much
                    recommended; for so warm a lodging is a great matter to young lambs, and will
                    tend much to forward their growth: the sheep will also be kept in good health;
                    and, what is a point of consequence to all farms, the quantity of dung raised
                    will be very great If this method is pursued through the months of December,
                    January, February, March, and April, with plenty of litter, 100 sheep will make
                    a dunghill of at least 60 loads of excellent stuff, which will amply manure two
                    acres of land; whereas 100 sheep folded (supposing the grass dry enough) will
                    not in that time equally manure an aere.”</p>
                <p>That such a method may be advantageous in particular eases, it would be rash to
                    deny; but, generally, it is not advisable, either on account of the sheep, or
                    any alleged advantage from the manure they make. As to the sheep, this driving
                    and confinement, especially in summer, would be just as hurtful as folding them
                    in the common way; and it has been found that their wool was much injured by the
                    broken litter mixing with the fleece, in a manner not to be easily separated;
                    besides, now that it is the great object of every skilful breeder to accelerate
                    the maturity of his sheep, as well as other live stock,—among other means, by
                    leaving them to feed at their ease, and, if circumstances permit, in small
                    parcels,—such a practice as this can never be admissible in their management.
                    And with regard to manure, there can be no difficulty in converting into it any
                    quantity of straw, stubble, and fern, by cattle fed in fold-yards, on green
                    herbage in summer, and turnips or other succulent food in winter; while the
                    soil, especially if it be of a light, porous quality, is greatly benefited, both
                    by the dung and treading of sheep allowed to consume the remainder of both sorts
                    of food on the ground. It is true that the dung of sheep has been generally
                    supposed to be more valuable than that of cattle; but accurate experiments have
                    not been made to determine the difference in this respect among these and other
                    polygastric animals. The greater improvement of pastures by sheep is probably
                    owing as much to their mode of feeding as to the richer quality of their
                    dung.</p>
                <p>On the subject of breeding and rearing sheep, it would be improper to omit
                    noticing the judicious and successful experiments of Dr Parry and others, in
                    crossing our native breeds with the Merino race, having for their object to
                    improve the carcass without deteriorating the quality of the wool.</p>
                <p>The land on which Dr Parry began his experiments was high, of a thin staple, dry,
                    unsheltered, and consequently unproductive; and as his other avocations did not
                    permit him constantly to superintend its management, he became impressed with
                    the belief that its most profitable application would be to a breed of sheep,
                    the return of which should chiefly depend on the fleece; and such a breed he
                    proposed to obtain by means of crossing with the Merinos, some of which had then
                    (1792) been recently imported by the king. Accordingly he fixed, as the basis of
                    his experiments, on the Ryeland breed, which has long been reputed as affording
                    some of the finest wool in the island.</p>
                <p>Dr Parry objects to washing the wool on the sheep’s back before shearing. The
                    fleece is so thick, that when thoroughly soaked with water it is very long in
                    drying; and if the weather prove wet and cold, the sheep are evidently much
                    incommoded. He therefore recommends public lavatories, as in Spain, for
                    cleansing the wool after being shorn. His sheep are shorn about the second week
                    of June; and if the weather be then unfavourable, he thinks it would be fit to
                    house them for two or three nights or days after the operation. The lambs have
                    been always shorn unwashed at the end of July or beginning of August, without
                    appearing to have suffered any injury. The fleece of such lambs as are rather
                    coarse, he thinks, should be always shorn, as he has shown that the wool of many
                    of this race is comparatively coarse, even in those individuals in which the
                    fleeces afterwards acquire the finest <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034177"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4177-0336"/>quality. The finer-fleeced lambs may be left
                    unshorn, as it has been proved that no loss is sustained by delaying shearing
                    them till the usual period.</p>
                <p>The effects of successive crosses, both on the form and the fleece of the
                    progeny, are ably illustrated by this accurate experimentalist. With regard to
                    the former, Dr Parry candidly declares that his only object, the improvement of
                    the fleece, did not allow him to give attention to the best 'forms in selecting
                    his breeders; but, notwithstanding this, “my sheep,” he observes, “are in
                    general shorter in the legs and necks, have smaller bones, a rounder barrel, a
                    wider loin, and consequently a better hind quarter, than any pure Merinos I have
                    happened to see, except one particular ram belonging to Lord Somerville.” This
                    change he attributes to the female or Ryeland blood, which, in forming the
                    progeny, acts most on the carcass, while that of the male or Merino chiefly
                    affects the skin and fleece.</p>
                <p>According to the general opinion of cultivators on the Continent, any breed of
                    ewes, however coarse and long in the fleece, will, on the fourth cross of the
                    Merino ram, give progeny with short wool equal to the Spanish. Of the truth of
                    this proposition, however, Dr Parry justly expresses some doubts, derived from
                    his own experience and that of others. But it is certain, he adds, that one
                    cross more will, in most cases, effect the desired purpose.</p>
                <p>“If we suppose the result of the admixture of the blood of the Merino ram to be
                    always in an exact arithmetical proportion, and state the native blood in the
                    ewe as 64, then the first cross would give ½⅜ of the Merino; the second, the
                    third, ½∣; the fourth,; the fifth, ∣⅛; the sixth, and so on. In other words, the
                    first cross would leave 32 parts in 64, or half of the English quality; the
                    second 16 parts, or one fourth; the third 8 parts, or one eighth; the fourth 4
                    parts, or one sixteenth; the fifth 2 parts, or one thirty-second; the sixth 1
                    part, or one sixty-fourth; and so on.</p>
                <p>Now, if the filament of the Wiltshire or any other coarse wool be in diameter
                    double that of the Ryeland, it is obvious that, according to the above
                    statement, it would require exactly one cross more to bring the hybrid wool of
                    the former to the same fineness as that of the latter. This, I believe, very
                    exactly corresponds with the fact. The difference between one eighth and one
                    sixteenth is very considerable, and must certainly be easily perceived, both by
                    a good microscope, and in the cloth which is manufactured from such wool. In the
                    latter method it certainly has been perceived; but I have hitherto had no
                    opportunity of trying the difference by the former. The fifth cross, as I have
                    before observed, brings the Merino-Wilts wool to the same standard as the fourth
                    of the Merino-Ryeland.” <hi rend="italic">( Communications to the Board of
                    Agriculture,</hi> vol. v. p. 438.)</p>
                <p>Several other distinguished individuals have taken a lead in improving the
                    fleeces of our native short-woolled breeds, by crossing them with the Merinos,
                    and, while their patriotic exertions deserve well of their country, have
                    considerably increased their own profits. At the head of these, perhaps, we
                    ought to place Lord Somerville, who undertook a voyage to Portugal for the sole
                    purpose of selecting from the best Spanish flocks such sheep as united in the
                    greatest degree the merit of a good carcass to a superior fleece.
                    Notwithstanding the difficulties he had to encounter, augmented by the war
                    between Great Britain and Spain, he brought home, in 1801, a flock of the first
                    quality, selected from the <hi rend="italic">Trashumante</hi> or travelling
                    breeds of Merinos, which was the admiration of the Spanish shepherds through
                    whose flocks they passed in their journey to England. Small flocks of Merinos
                    are now established in Ireland and Scotland; and the late Mr Malcolm Laing was
                    very successful with a numerous one, so far north as the Orkney Isles.</p>
                <p>We shall conclude our account of this valuable race and its cross-breeds with an
                    extract from a letter sent by Mr Birkbeck, a professional farmer of the highest
                    class, to Dr Parry, and quoted by the doctor in the essay above referred to.
                    “The fleeces of the first cross (between Merinos and South Downs), washed, are
                    to the parent South Downs as six to five in weight, and as three to two in value
                    per pound. Thus,</p>
                <p>100 South Down fleeces, 2½ lb. each at 2s. L.25.</p>
                <p>100 First cross 3 lb 3s. L.45.</p>
                <p>“So much for wool; and were it not for the air of extravagance it might give my
                    statement, I should add, that there is an evident improvement, as to usefulness
                    of form and disposition to fatten, in a large proportion of individuals. I had
                    the courage to exhibit at Lord Somerville’s show, in March last, five ewe-hogs
                    from your rams, and the honour to bear away the prize from all competitors, by
                    the merit of carcass and fleece jointly. On the whole, I believe that the
                    improvement of the wool may go on, without detriment to the carcass, until we
                    shall attain a breed of sheep with Spanish fleeces and English constitutions;
                    but I am also convinced that this must be the result of careful and judicious
                    selection.”</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Fatting.</hi></p>
                <p>After what has been said in the chapter on arable land (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Turnips,</hi> page 286), and in the second chapter (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pastures,</hi> page 310), little remains to be added on this point. The age at
                    which sheep are fatted depends upon the breed, some breeds, such as the
                    Leicester, maturing at an earlier age than others under the same circumstances;
                    and also on the abundance and quality of the food on which they are reared, a
                    disposition to early obesity, as well as a gradual tendency towards that form
                    which indicates a propensity to fatten, being materially promoted by rich food,
                    while the young animals are yet in a growing state. On good land, the Leicester
                    wethers are very generally brought to a profitable state of fatness before they
                    are eighteen months old, and are seldom kept on for fatting beyond the age of
                    two years. The Highland breeds, on the other hand, though prepared, by means of
                    turnips, a year at least sooner than they could be in former times, usually go
                    to the shambles when from three to four years old. The ewes of the first
                    description are commonly fatted after having brought lambs for three seasons,
                    that is, after they have completed their fourth year; and those of the small
                    breeds at from five to seven years of age, according to circumstances.</p>
                <p>Besides the numerous flocks fatted on pastures for the supply of the market
                    during summer, a very large proportion, especially of the sheep kept on arable
                    land, is fatted chiefly on turnips, the winter and spring consumption of
                    butcher-meat being now abundantly provided for by means of this root, in all
                    those districts where the best courses of husbandry prevail. We have already
                    mentioned the weight of the different breeds in the description of them —the
                    mode of feeding, under the heads of <hi rend="italic">Pastures</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Turnips</hi> —and shall now only add, that it is an invariable
                    rule with all good managers, never to allow this, or any other animal reared
                    solely for the shambles, ever to lose flesh, from its earliest age till it is
                    sent to the butcher;— that it is found of much advantage, with a view to speedy
                    fattening, as well as to the economy of food, to separate a flock into divisions
                    corresponding with its different ages, and the purpose of the owner as to the
                    time of carrying them to market ;—and that the change from the food of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193034190" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4190-0337"/> store to
                    fattening stock—from that which is barely capable of supporting the condition
                    which they have already attained, to that which is adapted to their speedy
                    improvement in fatting—ought to be gradual and progressive. Thus, very lean
                    sheep are never, in good management, put to full turnips in winter, nor to rich
                    pastures in summer; they are prepared for turnips on good grassland—often on the
                    aftergrass of mown grounds; and kept on second year’s leys, and afterwards a
                    moderate allowance of turnips, if they are to be fatted on pastures. It is a
                    common practice, in the instance of the Leicesters, to keep all that are not
                    meant for breeding always in a state of fatness; and, after full feeding on
                    turnips through winter and spring, to finish them on the first year’s clovers
                    early in summer, when the prices of meat are usually the highest.</p>
                <p>The luxury of the age has called forth the ingenuity of man to accelerate the
                    course of nature, at an expense which, in this species in particular, is in no
                    degree compensated by the intrinsic value of the young animal as human food. <hi
                    rend="italic">House-lambs</hi> are fed in such numbers as the demand may
                    require, in the vicinity of London and other large towns, where they are sold in
                    the early part of the season, commonly at much higher prices than fat sheep of
                    full growth. The Dorsetshire breed, as we formerly observed, can be made to yean
                    at almost any season of the year, and they arc therefore the only kind kept near
                    London. But in the neighbourhood of those towns where the rich are willing to
                    dispense with lamb during the early part of winter, other breeds arc made to
                    furnish the supply at a more advanced period of the season.</p>
                <p>The following account of the London practice may be useful to those farmers who
                    find it their interest to give their attention to this branch of management
                    ;—</p>
                <p>“The sucklers, salesmen, and butchers of London arc aware that such lambs as have
                    <hi rend="italic">sharp barbs</hi> on the inside of their lips are certainly of
                    a <hi rend="italic">deep colour</hi> after being butchered; and all those whose
                    <hi rend="italic">barbs</hi> are naturally <hi rend="italic">blunt</hi> do as
                    certainly <hi rend="italic">produce fair meat.</hi></p>
                <p>“This knowledge has been the occasion of <hi rend="italic">many lambs of the
                    latter kind being kept far rams, and sent into Dorsetshire, expressly far the
                    purpose of improving the colour of the flesh of house-lambs.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">The issue of such rams can generally be
                    warranted fair, and such meat always sells at a higher price</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> hence arose the mistaken notion, that Middlesex rams were
                    necessary to procure house-lambs.</p>
                <p>“The sheep, which begin to lamb about Michaelmas, are kept in the close during
                    the day, and in the house during the night, until they have produced twenty or
                    thirty lambs. These lambs are then put into a lamb-house, which is kept
                    constantly well littered with clean wheat-straw; and chalk, both in lump and in
                    powder, is provided for them to lick, in order to prevent looseness, and thereby
                    preserve the lambs in health. As a prevention against gnawing the boards, or
                    eating each other’s wool, a litttle wheβt-straw is placed, with the ears
                    downwards, in a rack within their reach, with which they amuse themselves, and
                    of which they eat a small quantity. In this house they are kept with great care
                    and attention until fit for the butcher.</p>
                <p>“The mothers of the lambs are turned, every night at eight o’clock, into the
                    lamb-house to their offspring. At six o’clock in the morning these mothers are
                    separated from their lambs and turned into the pastures; and, at eight o’clock,
                    such ewes as have lost their own lambs, and those ewes whose lambs are sold, are
                    brought in and held by the head till the lambs by turns suck them clean: they
                    are then turned into the pasture; and at twelve o’clock, the mothers of the
                    lambs are driven from the pasture into the lamb-house for an hour, in the course
                    of which time each lamb is suckled by its mother. At four o’clock all the ewes
                    that have not lambs of their own are again brought to the lamb-house, and held
                    for the lambs to suck; and at eight the mothers of the lambs are brought to them
                    for the night.</p>
                <p>“This method of suckling is continued all the year. The breeders select such of
                    the lambs as become fat enough, and of proper age (about eight weeks old), for
                    slaughter, and send them to market during December and three or four succeeding
                    months, at prices which vary from one guinea to four, and the rest of the year
                    at about two guineas each. This is severe work for the ewes, and some of them
                    die under excess of exhaustion. However, care is taken that they have plenty of
                    food; for when green food (viz. turnips, cole, rye, tares, clover, &amp;c.)
                    begins to fail, brewers’ grains are given them in troughs, and second-crop hay

                <p>Though there are many^instances of this, species of live stock being kept in such
                    numbers as to be a source of very considerable emolument to their owners, yet,
                    generally speaking, swine are viewed by farmers merely as a subordinate concern;
                    and perhaps, in most cases, their chief value is held to consist in their being
                    maintained on what would otherwise be entirely lost. With millers, brewers,
                    distillers, and dairymen, they are an object of more importance, and return, for
                    the offals they consume, a greater weight of meat (according to some, double the
                    weight) than could be obtained from cattle. In those parts where potatoes arc
                    raised as a fallow crop, much beyond the demand for them as human food, as is
                    the case in particular in Ireland and the west of Scotland, the rearing and
                    feeding of swine, most of which are sent to a distance in the state of bacon and
                    pickled pork, is a branch of management on which great dependence is placed for
                    the payment of their rents and other charges.</p>
                <p>It has been made a question, whether swine will pay for being wholly fed on crops
                    raised for this purpose; and various calculations have been offered, to show how
                    much they will return for a given quantity of corn and roots; but the results
                    are so discordant, that much more accurate experiments must be made before any
                    thing certain can be stated on this point Perhaps the principal consideration
                    which affects the question is, the extremely prolific nature of the animal,
                    which renders it easy, in a very short time, to supply them in too great numbers
                    for the demand. It is this circumstance, probably, that has, more than any
                    other, prevented the farmers of arable land from employing any large portion of
                    their crops in feeding swine, the flesh of which varies in price more than that
                    of other butcher-meat, and often at very short intervals. Yet if their food be
                    herbage and roots, with a small allowance of corn or pulse in the last stage of
                    fatting, and if the breeds arc judiciously chosen and well managed, there seems
                    no reason to doubt that, in many situations, swine will yield as much, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193034203" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4203-0338"/> perhaps, on an
                    average of years, a greater profit, for the food they consume, than any other
                    species of live stock.</p>
                <p>It is only in particular districts that so much attention has been paid to this
                    animal as to give rise to any accurate distinction of breeds; and nowhere has it
                    received any considerable portion of that care in breeding which has been so
                    advantageously employed on the other animals of which we have treated. Yet among
                    none of the varieties of those is there so great a difference as among the
                    breeds of this species, in regard to the meat they return for the consumption of
                    a given quantity of food. Some races can with difficulty be made fat, even at an
                    advanced age, though fed from the trough with abundance of such food as would
                    fatten any other animal; while others contrive to raise a valuable carcass out
                    of materials on which no other creature could subsist.</p>
                <p>Mr Culley mentions only three breeds, viz. the Berkshire, the Chinese, and the
                    Highland or Irish; but other writers have found a distinct breed in most of the
                    counties of England, which they have thought proper to de- * scribe separately.
                    The Chinese race has been subdivided into seven varieties or more; and it would
                    be easy to point out twice the number of as prominent distinctions among the
                    sorts in the third class. But such an affectation of accuracy is as useless as
                    it would be tedious. One general form, approaching to that of other animals kept
                    for their carcass, ought certainly to be preferred; and the size, which is the
                    other distinguishing characteristic, must be chosen with a view to the food
                    provided for their maintenance, and not because it is possible to raise the
                    individuals to a great and probably unprofitable weight. The fineness of bone,
                    and the broad though also deep form of the chest, denote in this, as in the
                    other species, a disposition to make fat with a moderate consumption of food;
                    and, while it may be advisable to prefer the larger breeds in those places where
                    bacon and flitches are in most demand, the smaller breeds are most esteemed for
                    pickling, and are, beyond all doubt, most profitable to those farmers who allow
                    them little else than the range of the farm-yard and the offals of the
                    kitchen.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Berkshire</hi> pigs, now spread through almost every part
                    of England and several places of Scotland, are in general of a reddish colour,
                    with black spots, large ears hanging over their eyes, short-legged, small-boned,
                    and inclined to make fat. The surprising weight that some of these hogs have
                    been fed to would be altogether incredible, were not the facts well attested.
                    “On Monday the 24th of January 1774, a pig (fed by Mr Joseph Lawton of Cheshire)
                    was killed, which measured, from the nose to the end of the tail, three yards
                    eight inches, and in height four feet five inches and a half. When alive,- it
                    weighed 12 cwt. 2 qrs. 10 lb.; when killed and dressed, it weighed 10 cwt. 3
                    qrs. 11 lb. or 86 stones 11 lb. avoirdupois.” (Culley <hi rend="italic">on Live
                    Stock,</hi> p. 173.)</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hampshire</hi> breed of hogs is also very large, being
                    longer in the body and neck, but not of so compact a form, as the Berkshire:
                    they are mostly white, and well disposed to fatten.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sussex</hi> pig is distinguished by being black and white,
                    but not spotted, frequently black at both ends, and white in the middle. Their
                    general size, when full-grown, is about 18 or 20 stone.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Suffolk</hi> white pig stands high, is narrow on the back,
                    with a broad forehead; the hair is short, with many bristles; weight 16 to 19
                    stone.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cheshire</hi> breed is distinguished by their gigantic
                    size: in colour they are black and white, blue and white (not spotted, but in
                    large patches of black or blue), and some all white. Their heads are large, with
                    very long ears, remarkably long in the body, very narrow in proportion to their
                    size, with large bones, long legs, and much loose skin.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Shropshire</hi> pig is also a large, coarse animal, with
                    much bone and hair, and many bristles; their colour mostly white, with black
                    patches, some rather sandy. They are said to be much liked by the
                    distillers.</p>
                <p>The largest breed of the island is supposed to be kept about Ruagcwick, on the
                    borders of Sussex and Surrey. They feed to an extraordinary size, and weigh, at
                    two years old, nearly double or triple the weight of most other sorts at that
                    age. <hi rend="italic">{Middlesex Reports</hi></p>
                <p>The Chinese breed is of different colours, white, black, black and white in
                    irregular patches, and of a sandy hue; and their size is no less varied, though
                    all of them smaller than the breeds already mentioned. The larger sort, such as
                    weigh 10 or 12 stones when about a year old, or rather perhaps a cross with some
                    native breed, may be recommended as the most suitable kind for arable farms,
                    when their maintenance is to be got chiefly in the fold-yards. The form of the
                    Chinese pig is generally good, and their flesh excellent; but it is easily made
                    too fat for delicate stomachs.</p>
                <p>The most numerous in the lowland counties of Scotland were, and in many places
                    still are, very unprofitable animals. They are of a white colour; have light,
                    narrow carcasses, with bristles standing up from nose to tail; long legs; and
                    are very slow feeders, even at an advanced age. In the Highlands and Hebrides
                    the breed, supposed by Dr Walker to be the aboriginal, is of “the smallest size,
                    neither white nor yellow, but of a uniform grey colour, and shaggy, with long
                    hair and bristles. They graze on the hills like sheep; their sole food is
                    herbage and roots, and on these they live the whole year round, without shelter,
                    and without receiving any other sustenance. In autumn, when they are in the best
                    order, their meat is excellent, and without any artificial feeding; but when
                    driven to the low country, they fatten readily, and rise to a considerable
                    bulk.” (Walker’s <hi rend="italic">Hebrides,</hi> vol. ii∙ p. 17.) In the Orkney
                    Islands they are commonly of a dark red, or nearly black colour, and have long
                    bristles, with a sort of coarse wool beneath them.</p>
                <p>The mode of <hi rend="italic">breeding,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">food,</hi> and
                    the general <hi rend="italic">management</hi> of swine, are all of them so much
                    dependent on local circumstances, and are so much varied in consequence, that it
                    is neither possible, nor would it be of any utility, to describe the practice of
                    different counties, or rather of almost every different individual.</p>
                <p>The period of gestation with swine is 16 weeks. The pigs are commonly weaned when
                    six weeks old; soon after which the sow is again in season, so that two litters
                    are usually farrowed within the year; sometimes, though very rarely, five
                    litters in two years. There are two things of particular importance to be
                    attended to in the breeding of swine. They should not be allowed to farrow in
                    winter, as young pigs are exceedingly tender, and can with difficulty be
                    preserved in very cold weather; nor at a time when food is scarce, as is
                    generally the case upon corn-farms in summer, if the stock of them is large. Ike
                    months of February and August have been recommended as the best periods for
                    parturition. (Henderson <hi rend="italic">on Swine,</hi> p. 27.) Twenty swine
                    are estimated to bring at an average seven pigs and a half each for their first
                    litter <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 17); but the number varies much, and
                    many young pigs are lost soon after their birth by the unkindness of their dam,
                    and by casualties, to which they are more exposed than most other young
                    animals.</p>
                <p>A sow in pigs should be· separated from the herd some time before she is expected
                    to farrow, carefully watched, and littered with a small quantity of dry short
                    straw. Too much straw is improper, both at the time of farrowing <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193034216" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4216-0339"/>and for a week or two
                    afterwards, as the pigs are apt to nestle beneath it unperceived by the sow, and
                    are thus in danger of being smothered when she lies down. A breeding sow should
                    be well fed, particularly when nursing; and it is advantageous early to accustom
                    the pigs to feed from a low trough, on milk or other liquid food mixed with meal
                    or bran. Such of the pigs of both sexes as are not to be kept for breeding are
                    usually castrated or spayed when about a month old, and the whole may be weaned
                    at the end of six or seven weeks. They should then be fed regularly three times
                    a day, with meal and water a little warmed, until they are able to shift for
                    themselves among the rest of the stock.</p>
                <p>The food allowed, whether to growing or fattening swine, depends on the
                    circumstances of their owners. The cottager’s pig must be contented with the
                    scanty offals of his kitchen and of his dairy, the produce generally of a single
                    cow. Towards the end of autumn a few potatoes are added, for the purpose of
                    preparing it for slaughter, and perhaps a little meal is mixed with boiled
                    potatoes for a week or two before. Such pigs, however, often thrive amazingly,
                    make themselves moderately fat, and form a must valuable addition to the winter
                    stores of their owners. In the south-eastern counties of Scotland, the hinds or
                    married ploughmen are commonly allowed to keep a pig each, which they feed in
                    this manner, and from which their families derive much benefit at very little
                    expense. On many corn-farms, the chief, and not unfrequently the only dependence
                    of swine, is on the strawyards. The sweepings of the barn-floor, corn left upon
                    the straw, and oats found among the dung of horses, with a share of the turnips
                    given to the cattle in winter, and of the clover in summer, afford ample
                    subsistence to swine, in the proportion, perhaps, of one to every five or six
                    acres under corn, clover, and turnips. The kitchen and dairy give some
                    assistance to pigs newly weaned, and also to such as are soon to be slaughtered.
                    A great many are killed when about a year old that have never been fed at any
                    expense that can be estimated. A fbw pigs, if of a good breed, will always be
                    moderately fat at that age with the run of the straw-yards, and their flesh is
                    of an excellent quality.</p>
                <p>When farmers find it profitable to keep large swine that cannot be fattened for
                    bacon, as is the practice in some of the western counties, without a regular
                    supply of food being served up to them, the method is, to rear them chiefly on
                    raw potatoes and Swedish turnips, and to fatten them on these roots boiled or
                    prepared by steam, with a mixture of oat, barley, or bean and peas meal. Their
                    troughs should be often replenished with a small quantity of food at a time, and
                    kept always clean; and their food changed occasionally, and seasoned with salt.
                    “If proper care be taken,” says a late writer, “a feeding pig should not consume
                    more than six Winchester bushels of oats made into meal. It ought to be shelled
                    before it is ground, the same as for family use, but need not be sifted.”
                    (Henderson’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Swine,</hi> p. 26.)</p>
                <p>Swine, it is well known, are very apt to get into forbidden ground: upon tillage
                    farms they are seldom, for this reason, permitted to go at large, unless
                    sometimes for a few weeks on the stubbles, or where the number is so large as to
                    afford the expense of constant herding. In many cases they are almost always
                    confined to the cattleyard, or a fold-yard beside their styes. Another bad
                    property in this animal is, the habit of digging into the soil; for which the
                    most effectual preventive is, to cut the two strong tendons of their snout, by a
                    slight incision with a sharp knife, about an inch and a half from the nose. This
                    may be done with little pain, and no prejudice to the animal, when about two or
                    three months old. The common practice of restraining them by rings fixed in the
                    snout is painful and troublesome: they must be replaced as often as they give
                    way; and that happens so frequently, that rings afford but little security
                    against this nuisance.</p>
                <p>Styes or swine-houses arc set down in different situations, according to the
                    numbers kept, and the manner of feeding them. The cottager erects a little hut
                    contiguous to his dwelling, and many small farmers also choose to lodge them
                    near the kitchen. If swine are kept chiefly in the straw-yard, their houses are
                    so situated as to give ready access by a door which opens into it. See Plate XI.
                    The gentleman-farmer erects a range of low buildings on that side of his
                    farm-offices which is least exposed to view, and incloses and subdivides a small
                    yard for their use. Where this branch of husbandry is carried on in all its
                    parts, there must be separate houses for sows heavy with young, for such as are
                    nursing, for pigs newly weaned, and for rearing and for fattening stock. <hi

                <p>In the pickling and kitting of pork, a branch of business which is carried on to
                    a considerable extent at many of our seaports, the carcass is cut in pieces, and
                    packed in kits made for the purpose, containing from one to two cwt. Salt is
                    dissolved in water till the mixture be strong enough to swim an egg; it is then
                    boiled, and, when cold, poured upon the pork. When the end of the kit is fixed
                    in, the article is ready for being sent to market.</p>
                <p>A late writer has given particular directions for the curing of bacon, founded
                    upon a long course of experience, which therefore deserve to be more generally
                    known. We shall give them in his own words.</p>
                <p>“After the carcass has hung all night, lay it upon a strong table or bench, upon
                    its back, cut off the head close by the ears, and cut the hinder feet so far
                    below the hough as will not disfigure the hams, and have plenty of room to hang
                    them by. Then take a cleaving knife, and, if necessary, a hand-mallet, and
                    divide the carcass up the middle of the back-bone, laying it in two equal
                    halves. Then cut the ham from the side by the second joint of the back-bone,
                    which will appear on dividing the carcass; then dress the ham, by paring a
                    little off the flank or skinny part, so as to shape it with a half-round point,
                    clearing off any top fat that may appear. The curer will next take off the sharp
                    edge along the back-bone with his knife and mallet, and slice off the first rib
                    next the shoulder, where he will perceive a bloody vein, which he must take out,
                    for if it is left in, that part is apt to spoil. The corners must be squared off
                    where the ham was cut out.</p>
                <p>“In killing a number of swine, what sides you may have dressed the first day lay
                    upon some flags or boards, piling them across each other, and giving each flitch
                    a powdering of saltpetre, and then covering it with salt. Proceed in the same
                    manner with the hams by themselves, and do not omit giving them a little
                    saltpetre, as it opens the pores of the flesh to receive the salt, and besides
                    gives the ham a pleasant flavour, and makes it more juicy.</p>
                <p>“Let them lie in this state about a week, then turn those on the top undermost,
                    giving them a fresh salting. After lying two or three weeks longer, they may be
                    hung up to dry in some chimney or smoke-house. Or, if the curer chooses, he may
                    turn them over again, without giving them anymore salt; in which state they may
                    lie for a month or two without catching any harm, until he has convenience for
                    drying them. I practised for many years the custom of carting my flitches and
                    hams through the country to farm-houses, and used to hang them in their chimneys
                    and other parts of the house to dry, some seasons to the amount of five hundred
                    carcasses. This plan I <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034229"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4229-0340"/>soon found was attended with a number of
                    inconveniences, yet it is still common in Dumfries-shire.</p>
                <p>“About twenty years ago I contrived a small smokehouse, of a very simple
                    construction. It is about twelve feet square, and the walls about seven feet
                    high. One of these huts requires six joists across, one close to each wall, the
                    other four laid asunder at proper distances. To receive five rows of flitches,
                    they must be laid on the top of the wall. A piece of wood, strong enough to bear
                    the weight of one flitch of bacon, must be fixed across the belly end of the
                    flitch by two strings, as the neck end must hang downwards. The piece of wood
                    must be longer than the flitch is wide, so that each end may rest upon a beam.
                    They may be put so near to each other as not to touch. The width of it will hold
                    24 flitches in a row, and there will be five rows, which will contain 120
                    flitches. As many hams may be hung at the same time above the flitches,
                    contrived in the best manner one can. The lower end of the flitches will be
                    within 2½ or 3 feet of the floor, which must be covered five or six inches thick
                    with sawdust, which must be kindled at two different sides. It will burn, but
                    not cause any flame to injure the bacon. The door must be kept close, and the
                    hut must have a small hole in the roof, so that part of the smoke may ascend.
                    That lot of bacon and hams will be ready to pack up in a hogshead to send off in
                    eight or ten days, or a little longer, if required, with very little loss of
                    weight. After thebacon is salted, it may lie in the salt-house as described,
                    until an order is received, then immediately hang it up to dry.</p>
                <p>“I found the smoke-house to be a great saving, not only in the expense and
                    trouble of employing men to cart and hang it through the country, but it did not
                    lose nearly so much weight by this process.</p>
                <p>“It may be remarked, that whatever is shipped for the London market, or any
                    other, both bacon and hams, must be knocked hard, and packed into a sugar
                    hogshead, or something similar, to hold about ten hundredweights. Bacon can only
                    be cured from the middle of September until the middle of April.” (Henderson’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Swine,</hi> p. 39.)</p>
                <p>The treatment of boars for brawn, and the after-preparation of the article, is
                    carried on in Kent and some other parts of England; but it is the object of
                    those concerned in this business to keep the process secret. According to
                    answers returned to queries transmitted by the Board of Agriculture in 1804, the
                    boars are put up for feeding at all ages, and in an entire state; but they are
                    preferred when only two years old. They were usually kept apart, each of them in
                    a case so small as not to be able to turn round, but sometimes eight together in
                    larger pens. Their food is beans, with sulphur given in their water. A large
                    animal is preferred, producing a collar of about 30 lb. weight, which then
                    brought 2s. per lb.; the lean parts being made into sausage meat, and sold at6d.

                <p>The value of these animals, as agricultural live stock, is comparatively
                    inconsiderable in Britain, notwithstanding their importance in some other
                    countries; and, in an economical view, some of them are undoubtedly wasteful and
                    pernicious. <hi rend="italic">Asses</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mules</hi> are
                    seldom or never employed in field labour, though it was the opinion of Mr
                    Bakewell, and a few other eminent agriculturists, that there would be some
                    advantage in propagating the ass on account of its hardiness, and the coarse
                    food on which it may be maintained. Trials have been made to improve our present
                    breeds, by crosses with males introduced from foreign parts, without having had
                    the effect, however, of bringing them into use, either for the plough or the
                    cart; and wherever the services of a small animal are required, we have horses
                    of all sizes, from nine to eighteen hands high, which seem better adapted to
                    every purpose than asses or mules. <hi rend="italic">Goats</hi> are to be found
                    only in small numbers, except in some parts of the Highlands, and are kept

                    are justly considered as a nuisance by every respectable writer on rural
                    economy, and certainly by every farmer who is within the reach of their
                    depredations.</p>

                    opinion still exists among intelligent men, though there are perhaps very few
                    situations in which they can be considered as more profitable than any other
                    mode of occupancy. It is not merely that they in general return less for their
                    food than other stock, but that they are also very difficult to confine, and
                    most destructive to the crops and fences in their vicinity. Their number, though
                    still considerable, has accordingly decreased, and continues to decrease, with
                    the progress of improvement; and unless their skins shall become of much greater
                    value than at present, they can be an object of consideration only on such
                    tracts as must otherwise be left to the animals that are still in a state of
                    nature. In the present state of our agriculture, however, if it be found
                    advantageous to retain this species, it is proper that the best breeds and the
                    best mode of management, as well as their value, should be known.</p>
                <p>A deep, sandy, poor soil is the most suitable for rabbits, though, under good
                    management, as turnips must be provided for winter, there should be parts of it
                    capable of bearing that and other crops; and the situation may be either on the
                    sides of hills or on a flat surface. Artificial burrows are made with an auger,
                    to reconcile them to the ground, and to preserve them from vermin, until they
                    have time to make their own burrows; and on level warrens, this implement may be
                    usefully employed from time to time afterwards. Warrens are commonly fenced with
                    a sod wall, capped with furze or black thorn, in all about six feet high, and
                    should always be kept in complete repair. Besides the rabbits, a number of sheep
                    are usually kept in these grounds during the summer.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">silver-haired</hi> rabbit is now more esteemed than the <hi
                    rend="italic">grey,</hi> though the latter is so much hardier, that if a warren
                    be stocked with both, there will in a few years be nothing but greys. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lincolnshire Report,</hi> p. 382.) The skin of the grey rabbit is
                    <hi rend="italic">cut,</hi> that is, the “wool” is pared off the pelt, as a
                    material of hats; whereas that of the silver-haired, which sells much higher, is
                    dressed as fur, and goes, it is said, principally to the East Indies.
                    (Marshall’s <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire,</hi> vol. ii. p. 265.)</p>
                <p>One buck will serve one hundred does; the doe takes the buck the day she brings
                    forth, and goes thirty-one days with young, which she suckles for about
                    twenty-two days, for the first half of which they are blind. But when confined
                    in warrens, rabbits seldom breed more than twice a year, and some of them only
                    once: in particularly wet, cold seasons, few or none bring more than one litter.
                    (Parkinson <hi rend="italic">on Live Stock,</hi> vol. ii. p. 299.) The skins are
                    in their best state from the middle of November till Christmas, during which
                    period all that are not to be kept for breeding are slaughtered. Silver skins
                    have been sold of late at from 15s. to 21s. a dozen.</p>
                <p>“The best manner of taking rabbits is by folds, by means of nets and cords. The
                    day before the rabbits are intended to be taken, the warrener, with his
                    assistants, incloses many acres of ground, the bank generally making <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193034242" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4242-0341"/> one end, and
                    sometimes part of a side: the fore part of the fold is left entirely open.
                    Rabbits form their colonies in some part all together, at a distance from their
                    feeding ground, and nearly all leave their home or burrows at the time of
                    feeding, when the warrener fixes his nets, by two men beginning at each end, who
                    meet in the middle. Thus, in fine dry weather they can nearly take all that is
                    wanted at once; but it is a general practice to fold at two separate times from
                    each colony. Within the fold are formed what are termed angles, in that part
                    nearest to the burrows; as the rabbits, when they return, and find themselves
                    checked in getting home, will beat about by the nets. These angles are therefore
                    so contrived as to afford them an opportunity of secreting themselves, and are
                    made thus :—an irregular groove or channel is cut, about twelve or fourteen
                    inches deep, and about twelve inches wide, the sods being set up one against
                    another over the groove, so as to form a ridge like the roof of a house. These
                    channels are made of equal lengths, both ends being left open, so that when the
                    rabbits meet they are head to head. When the rabbits find themselves prevented
                    from returning to their former homes, and the day-light appears, hearing the
                    warrener and his dogs enter the fold, they quickly run into the angles, when the
                    warrener puts a sod against the open ends, to prevent their return. The few
                    straggling rabbits remaining in the fold are hunted by boys with dogs; but the
                    warreners have recourse to that method as little as possible, the dogs being apt
                    to tear the skin, and injure the carcass.” (Parkinson <hi rend="italic">on Live
                    Stock,</hi> vol. ii. p. 299.)</p>
                <p>“Turnips, clover, and sainfoin are the most proper kinds of winter food for
                    rabbits, as also threshed oats or barley, when corn is tolerably cheap, may be
                    given them with great propriety. The two latter need only be allowed when the
                    ground is covered with snow, and when it does not blow about so as to cover the
                    corn when laid down; but in severe storms, turnips are the most proper food, as
                    they can find them by their scent, and will scratch the snow off when covered.
                    Three large cart-loads of turnips a day will fodder one thousand or one thousand
                    one hundred couples of rabbits, which are about a proper quantity to be left as
                    breeding stock on 500 acres of inclosed warren land. In heavy snows, a great
                    deal of money must be expended in clearing the snow from the warren walls, in
                    order to keep as much as possible the rabbits within their bounds.” <hi

                    feeding chiefly on pernicious insects, are probably deserving of more attention
                    than has hitherto been paid to them. But <hi rend="italic">common fowls</hi> are
                    by far the most numerous, and everywhere add something not inconsiderable to the
                    income of the inhabitants of the country, and to the stock of food for the
                    consumption of the people at large. The trade in eggs alone, between the country
                    and the towns, is a matter of some importance, as affording profitable
                    employment to those who collect them, and to others who afterwards send them in
                    large quantities to the principal towns. According to the statistical account of
                    Scotland, the people of Hawick, a small town in the county of Roxburgh, more
                    than twenty years <hi rend="italic">ago</hi> received L.50 weekly through the
                    year, for eggs collected in the neighbourhood, and sent to Berwick for the
                    London market; and in 1796 it was calculated that the peasantry of Mid-Lothian
                    drew L.8000 a year for poultry and eggs. But in the way these fowls are commonly
                    managed by farmers, there is reason to doubt whether they pay for the food they
                    consume, and the waste they are too often allowed to commit. The number kept by
                    any individual is commonly so small as to obtain little of that attention that
                    is given to other domesticated animals, and their ravages are accordingly
                    greater, and the returns smaller, than they would otherwise be.' Yet in the warm
                    cottages of country labourers, the common farm-yard hen makes a valuable return
                    for the food she requires, which is frequently potatoes, boiled and mashed, with
                    a little oat-meal porridge, a portion of the daily meal of its owner. A
                    comfortable degree of warmth is so essential, that some gentlemen have had
                    stoves placed under their roosts.</p>
                <p>The results of an experiment made with six hens and a cock in 1807 and 1808 were,
                    that they ate half a peck of barley weekly, with very little other food, and
                    laid 764 eggs in 52 weeks, the greatest number in the months of <pb break="no"

                    smallest in November and December. The eggs were sold in the London market at
                    l½d. each, and the net profit, besides 11 chickens, was L.2. 12s. 2d. They were
                    confined in a small yard, well sheltered and heated by the fires of the houses

                <p>CHAP. IV.</p>
                <p>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE AGRICULTURE OF BRITAIN.</p>
                <p>The husbandry of a great part of Britain, both in respect to the cultivation of
                    the soil and the breeding and management of live stock, is confessedly superior
                    to that of any other country in Europe; and the quantity and value of its
                    products, considering the character of the climate, as well as the industry,
                    wealth, and respectability of its husbandmen, are without any parallel either in
                    ancient or modem times. We find from Columella, that, under the Romans, the
                    produce of the greater part of Italy was less than four times the seed (lib.
                    iii. cap. 3); and this notwithstanding an unproductive fallow every second year,
                    and apparently a much greater attention to minutiae than would be compatible
                    with the more extensive concerns of the British farmer. The average crops of
                    Britain have been stated so high as nine times the seed, and certainly, wherever
                    the management is tolerably correct, cannot be less than double the proportion
                    assigned by Columella to the richer soil and more genial climate of Italy. Of
                    the agriculture of France before the Revolution a very full and accurate account
                    has been furnished by Mr Arthur Young, from which it is sufficiently evident how
                    much the general produce of that country, the best cultivated perhaps next to
                    Britain, was inferior to that of even our middling lands; and the progress it
                    has made since has not, according to the latest and apparently exaggerated
                    accounts, been marked by any very great improvement either in live stock or
                    machinery, the two most distinguishing parts of British husbandry.</p>
                <p>It is natural to ask, to what causes this superiority is owing; and why it is
                    confined to a part of our territory, instead of being extended, as our great
                    demand of late for foreign corn would have led us to expect, to all soils that
                    are capable of profitable improvement. On these two points we now propose to
                    offer a few very general remarks; and we shall submit them to the reader without
                    affecting that precision of arrangement which more ample details would have
                    required.</p>
                <p>1. The territory of Britain is not engrossed by a few individuals, like the
                    northern countries of Europe, nor divided into such minute portions as that of
                    some of the small states of the Continent. The vast tracts of country held by a
                    Russian or Polish nobleman, and the diminutive possessions of the Swiss, and
                    more lately of the French peasantry, are almost equally inconsistent with the
                    more productive systems of rural economy. The former are too large for the
                    superintendence of one individual with a view to profitable cultivation; and the
                    existence of such extensive properties implies the degradation and poverty of
                    the great body of the people, and the absence of a middle class, possessed of
                    disposable capital, or at least of opportunities for its investment in the soil.
                    The latter, on the other hand, afford no room for the employment of capital, nor
                    of those inventions by which the charges of cultivation are diminished, and its
                    products augmented. Such small landed properties return little more than the
                    wages of the manual labour by which they must necessarily be cultivated. Their
                    small surplus produce, which every bad season annihilates, cannot afford
                    subsistence to those other classes whose labours are necessary to national
                    prosperity and individual comfort; and a part of the families of the cultivators
                    themselves, having neither food nor employment at home, must either emigrate or
                    perish. To a certain extent these consequences have been already experienced,
                    both in Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland; for it would be idle to maintain
                    that a minute division of land in tenancy does not produce all the unhappy
                    effects which must result from the minute division of land in absolute
                    property.</p>
                <p>Of two counties, in one of which estates are in general too large for the
                    personal superintendence of the proprietors, and, in the other, the land is
                    parcelled out into shares little more than sufficient for the subsistence of
                    their owners, the condition of the great body of the people must be very much
                    alike. In neither can there exist that middle class from which all valuable
                    improvements proceed, nor any of those inventions which multiply and augment the
                    productive powers of human industry. Both of these states of property must
                    appear decidedly unfavourable to national prosperity, when measured by this
                    unerring test—the quantity of the products of the soil which remains after
                    defraying the charges of obtaining them; for upon this net surplus depend all
                    the enjoyments of mankind beyond the mere necessaries of life, as well as the
                    means of repelling foreign aggression, and preserving internal tranquillity.</p>
                <p>The distribution of the landed property of Britain is equally distant from both
                    these extremes. Though it is necessary, perhaps, to the political constitution
                    of the country, that there should be a number of large estates, yet their extent
                    is seldom so great as to produce any of the bad effects just mentioned, even
                    within the bounds of a single county. Over the rural economy of the nation these
                    large properties exert scarcely any influence at all, excepting such of them as
                    are held by entail, which is certainly a mode of tenure greatly at variance with
                    the full improvement of the soil. Many instances might be pointed out, of very
                    extensive estates, fully as well cultivated, and yielding as large a surplus for
                    the general consumption, as our agriculture, in its present state, obtains from
                    any equal extent of similar land. It is true, that to increase the political
                    influence of great proprietors, too many of these estates are possessed by
                    tenants at will; but this grievance is not peculiar to such estates, the largest
                    estates of Scotland being occupied on leases. This most serious obstacle to
                    spirited cultivation must therefore be ascribed to political causes, and not to
                    the engrossing of landed property.</p>
                <p>2. Another arrangement, which may serve to account for the superiority of British
                    agriculture, is somewhat akin to that division of labour by which all the arts
                    have been carried to so great a degree of perfection in this country. Few great
                    proprietors, comparatively, cultivate their own lands beyond the demands of
                    pleasure and convenience. The far greater part of Britain is cultivated by
                    professional men, with their own capital, and for their own profit. The price
                    which they must pay for their temporary rights in the soil, in the shape of
                    rent, instead of checking their exertions, has a powerful tendency to promote
                    every profitable improvement, to discourage dangerous speculation, and to
                    restrain wasteful expenditure. And as it is clearly the interest of such <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193034268" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4268-0343"/> men, still more
                    than of proprietors themselves, to obtain the largest produce at the least
                    possible expense, the intermediate portion of the produce—that which is
                    disposable for the general consumption—is consequently as large as industry and
                    economy, in the present state of our agriculture, can make it. It is true almost
                    to a proverb, that farming upon an extensive scale is never profitable to a
                    great landholder; and, with a view to the interest of the nation, it ought to be
                    discouraged, as both wasteful and unproductive. In some countries this mode of
                    farming is a matter of necessity, as in the north of Europe, where a class of
                    free tenants does not exist; in others the business of cultivation must be
                    carried on as a sort of partnership, or joint concern between the proprietor and
                    tenant, as on the <hi rend="italic">métairies</hi> of France. Fortunately, the
                    general distribution of wealth has long since removed the necessity for either
                    of these methods in Britain.</p>
                <p>To give full effect to the professional system, it is necessary that the rights
                    of the landlord and tenant, respectively, should be clearly defined and well
                    secured by law and the private contract of the parties. The general principle
                    which should regulate the terms of this connection seems to be, that while the
                    farm ought to be restored to the owner at the expiration of the tenant’s
                    interest, at least without deterioration, the tenant should be encouraged to
                    render it as productive as possible during his possession. In both of these
                    views a lease for a term of years is scarcely less nécessary for the interest of
                    the landlord than of the tenant; and so much is the public interested in this
                    measure, that it has been proposed by intelligent men to impose a penal tax on
                    the rent of lands held by tenants at will.</p>
                <p>That the value of the property is enhanced by the security which such a lease
                    confers on the tenant, will be put beyond all doubt, if the rents of two estates
                    for half a century back are compared; the one occupied by tenants at will, and
                    the other by tenants on leases for a moderate term, and where the soil and
                    situation are nearly alike in every respect. If the comparison be made between
                    two tracts originally very different in point of value, the advantages of leases
                    will be still more striking. While that which is held by tenants at will remains
                    nearly stationary, the other is gradually yet effectually improved, under the
                    security of leases, by the tenant’s capital; and, in no long period, the latter
                    takes the lead of the former, both in the amount of the revenue which it yields
                    to the proprietor, and in the quantity of produce which it furnishes for the
                    general consumption. The higher rents and greater produce of some parts of
                    Scotland, than of many of the English counties, where the soil, climate, and
                    markets are much more favourable, must be ascribed to the almost universal
                    practice of holding on leases in the former country, in a much greater degree
                    than to any of the causes which have been frequently assigned. Less than a
                    century ago, what are now the best cultivated districts of Scotland were very
                    far behind the greater part of England, and indeed had made very little progress
                    from the time of the feudal system. It is not 50 years since the farmers of
                    Scotland were in the practice of going to learn from their southern neighbours
                    an art which was then very imperfectly known in their own country. But in
                    several parts of England there has been little or no improvement since, while
                    the southern counties of Scotland have uniformly advanced, and at present
                    exhibit, very generally, a happy contrast to their condition at the middle of
                    last century.</p>
                <p>In respect to farmers themselves, it cannot be necessary to point out the
                    advantages of leases. It may be true that, under the security of the honour of
                    an English landlord, tenants at will have been continued in possession from
                    generation to generation, and acquired wealth which he has never, like the
                    landholders of some other countries, attempted to wrest from them. But there are
                    few individuals in any rank of life who continue for a length of time to
                    sacrifice their just claims on the altar of pure generosity. Something is almost
                    always expected in return. A portion of revenue in this case is exchanged for
                    power, and that power is displayed not only in the habitual degradation of the
                    tenantry, but in the control over them, which the landlord never fails to exert
                    at the election of members of Parliament, and on all other political
                    emergencies. No prudent man will ever invest his fortune in the improvement of
                    another person’s property, unless, from the length of his lease, he has a
                    reasonable prospect of being reimbursed with profit; and the servility which
                    holding at will necessarily exacts is altogether incompatible with that spirit
                    of enterprise which belongs to an enlightened and independent mind.</p>
                <p>The people at large are evidently most deeply affected by every measure which has
                    a tendency to fetter the productive powers of the soil, and, at the same time,
                    to depress one of their largest and most valuable classes. It is clearly their
                    interest that corn and other provisions should be supplied in abundance; and the
                    people of England may justly complain of the want of leases as one of the
                    principal causes which check the improvement of their own territory.</p>
                <p>Wliat ought to be the term of a lease, can only be determined by a reference to
                    the circumstances of each particular case. Lands naturally rich, or such as have
                    already been brought to a high degree of fertility, requiring no great
                    investment of capital, and returning all or nearly all the necessary outlay
                    within the year, may be advantageously held upon short leases—such perhaps as
                    give time for two or at most three of the rotations or courses of crops to which
                    the quality of the soil is best adapted. The practice of England in this respect
                    is extremely various,—almost every term, from twenty years downwards, being
                    found in different parts of it In Scotland, by far the most common period is
                    nineteen years, to which it was formerly the practice, in some places, to add
                    the life of the tenant. In that country, even when it is thought expedient to
                    agree for a much longer term, this is still expressed in periods of nineteen
                    years,—a sort of mysterious cycle, which seems to be no less a favourite with
                    the courts of law than with landholders and farmers. Yet this term is somewhat
                    inconvenient, as it can never correspond with any number of the recognised
                    rotations of arable land.</p>
                <p>It has been maintained by several writers, that a lease for twenty years is not
                    sufficient to reimburse a tenant for any considerable improvements; and
                    landholdershave often been urged to agree to a much longer term, which, it is
                    alleged, would be not less for their own interest than for that of the tenant.
                    This is a question which our limits do not permit us to discuss; but after
                    viewing it in different lights, assisted by the experience of long leases in
                    different parts of Scotland, we cannot help expressing some doubts of their
                    utility, even as regards the parties themselves; and we are decidedly of
                    opinion, that a greater produce will be brought to market, from any given extent
                    of land held on successive leases of twenty years, for half a century, than if
                    held on one lease of that duration, whether the term be specified or indefinite,
                    as in the case of a lease for life. As a general mode of tenure, leases for
                    lives seem to us particularly objectionable.</p>
                <p>The great advantages of a lease are so well known in Scotland, that one of her
                    best agricultural writers, himself <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034281"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4281-0344"/>a landed proprietor, has suggested a method of
                    conferring on it the character of perpetu,ity, to such an extent as, he thinks,
                    would give ample security to the tenant for every profitable improvement,
                    without preventing the landlord from resuming possession upon equitable terms,
                    at the expiration of every specified period. But the author of this plan (Lord
                    Kames), in his ardent wishes for the advancement of agriculture, at that time in
                    a very backward state in his native country, seems to have overlooked the
                    diffi-cultiés that stood in the way of its adoption; and the great advance in
                    the price of produce, and consequently in the rate of rents, since his Lordship
                    wrote, has long since put an end to the discussion which his proposal excited.
                    For a form of a lease on his plan, the reader may consult Bell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise on Leases</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the objections
                    to the plan itself are shortly stated in the supplement to the sixth edition of
                    Kames’s <hi rend="italic">Gentleman Farmer,</hi> published in ’ 1815.</p>
                <p>Long leases have been sometimes granted upon condition of receiving an advance of
                    rent at the end of a certain number of years; but covenants of this kind, meant
                    to apply to the circumstances of a distant period, cannot possibly be framed in
                    such a manner as to do equal justice to both parties; and it ought not to be
                    concealed, that, in every case of a very long lease, the chances are rather more
                    unfavourable to the landholder than to the farmer. If the price of produce rise
                    as if has done for the last fifty years, no improvements which a tenant can be
                    expected to execute will compensate the landlord’s loss; and if, on the other
                    hand, prices shall decline, the capital of most tenants must be exhausted in a
                    few years, and the lands will necessarily revert to the proprietor, as has often
                    been the case of late. Hence a landholder, in agreeing to a long lease, can
                    hardly ever assure himself that the obligations on the part or the tenant will
                    be fully discharged throughout its whole term, while the obligations he incurs
                    himself may always be easily enforced. He runs the risk of great loss from a
                    depreciation of money, but can look forward to very little benefit from a
                    depreciation of produce, except for a few years at most. Of this advantage a
                    generous man would seldom avail himself; and, indeed, in most instances,'the
                    advantage must be only imaginary, for it would be overbalanced by the
                    deterioration of his property.</p>
                <p>Where the circumstances of ä landholder, the state of his property, and the
                    wealth and enterprising character of the tenantry, are such as to render long
                    leases, or leases for an indefinite period, expedient, the most equitable mode,
                    in regard to rent, would be to make it·rise and fall with the price of corn or
                    other produce. ' A rent paid in corn is, indeed, liable, to serious objections,
                    and can seldom be advisable in a commercial country. It necessarily bears
                    hardest on a tenant when he is least able to dis^ charge it. In very bad seasons
                    his crop may be so scanty as scarcely to return seed and the expenses of
                    cultivation; and the share which he ought to receive himself, as the {ι'rofits
                    of his'capital, as well as the quantity allotted to the ahdTord, may not exist
                    at all. Though, in this case, if he pays a money rent, his loss maybe
                    considerable, it maybe twice or thrcc times greater if the rent is to be paid in
                    corn, or according to the high price of such seasons. In Jess favourable years,
                    which often occur in " the variable climate of 'Britain, a corn-rent would, in
                    numerous instances, absórb nearly the whole free or disposable’produce, as it is
                    by no, means uncommon to find, the gross produce of even good land reduced from
                    twenty to fifty per cérit. belowan average, in particular ∙seasons. And it ought
                    to be considered, m regard to the landlςrd hiniself, that his income woùld
                    thus’be doubled or trebled, ata time when all other classes were suffering from
                    scarcity and consequent dearth; while, in times of plenty and cheapness, he
                    might find it difficult to make his expenses correspond with the great
                    diminution of his receipts. It is of much importance to both parties that the
                    amount of the rent should vary as little as possible from any unforeseen causes,
                    though tenants in general would be perhaps the most injured by such
                    fluctuations.</p>
                <p>To obviate these and other objections to a corn-rent, and to do equal justice at
                    all times to both landlord and tenant, a plan has been suggested for converting
                    the corn into money, adopting for its price, not the price of the year for which
                    the rent is payable, but the average price of a certain number of years. The
                    rent, according to this plan, may be calculated every year, by omitting the
                    first year of the series, and adding a new one; or, it may continue the same for
                    a certain number of yςars, and then be fixed according to a new average. Let us
                    suppose the lease to be for twenty-one years, the average agreed on being seven
                    years, and the first year’s rent, that is, the price of so many quarters of
                    corn, will be calculated from the average price of the crop of that year, and of
                    the six years preceding. If it be meant to take a new average for the second and
                    every succeeding year’s rent, all that is necessary is, to strike off the first
                    of these seven years, adding the year for which the rent is payable, and so on
                    during all the years of the lease. But this labour, slight as it is, may be
                    dispensed with, by continuing the rent without variation for the first seven
                    years of the lease, according to the average price of the seven years
                    immediately preceding its commencement, and, at the end of this period, fixing a
                    new rent, according to the average price of the seven years just expired, to
                    continue for the next seven years. Thus, in the course of twenty-one years, the
                    rent would be calculated only three times; and for whatever quantity of corn the
                    parties had agreed, the money payments would be equal to the average price of
                    fourteen years of the lease itself, and of the seven years preceding it; and the
                    price of the last seven years of the old lease would determine the rent during
                    the first seven years of the new One.</p>
                <p>The landlord and tenant, it has been thought, could not suffer either from bad
                    seasons or any change in the value of the currency, should such a lease as this
                    be extended to several periods of twenty-one years. The quantity of corn to be
                    taken as rent is the only point that would require to be settled at the
                    commencement of each of these periods; and though this would no doubt be greater
                    or less, according to the state of the lands at the time, yet it may be expected
                    that, in the twenty-one years preceding, all the tenant’s judicious expenditure
                    had been fully replaced. Instead of the twofold difficulty in fixing a rent for
                    a long lease, arising from uncertainty as to the quantify of produce, which must
                    depend on the state of improvement, and still more perhaps from the variations
                    in the price of that produce, the latter objection is <hi rend="superscript"
                    >!</hi> entirely removed by this plan; and in all cases where land is already
                    brought to a high degree of fertility,’ the question about the quantity of
                    produce may likewise be dispensed</p>
                <p>Upon this plan we shall take leave to observe, that if it be applied to leases of
                    nineteen or twenty-one years, the inconvenience resulting from uncertainty as to
                    the amount of rent, as well as other difficulties which must necessarily attend
                    it, would be as great perhaps as any advantages which it holds out to either of
                    the parties. If it be said that, a rent determined by’ a seven years’ average
                    could not suddenly nor materially altér, this is at once to admit the inutility
                    of the contrivance. The first thing which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034294"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4294-0345"/>must strike every practical man is, that corn is
                    not the only produce of a farm, and, in most parts of Britain, perhaps not the
                    principal source from which rent is paid; and there is no authentic record of
                    the prices of butchermeat, wool, cheese, butter, and other articles in every
                    county to refer to, as there is of corn. This is not the place to inquire
                    whether the price of corn regulates the price of all the other products of land,
                    in a country whose statute-books are full of. duties, bounties, drawbacks,
                    &amp;c. to say nothing of its internal regulations; but it is sufficiently
                    evident, that, if corn does possess this power, its price operates too slowly on
                    that of other products, to serve as a just criterion for determining rent on a
                    lease of this duration. Besides, in the progress of agriculture, new species or
                    varieties of the <hi rend="italic">cerealia</hi> themselves are established even
                    in so short a period as twenty-one years, the price of which may be very
                    different from that of the corn specified in the lease. What security for a full
                    rent, for instance, would it give to a landlord, to make the rent payable
                    according to the price of barley, when the tenant might find it more for his
                    interest to cultivate some of the varieties of summer wheat? or according to the
                    price of a particular variety of oats, when, within a few years, we have seen
                    all the old varieties superseded, throughout extensive districts, by the
                    introduction of a new one, the potato-oat, which may not be more permanent than
                    those that preceded it? There may be no impropriety in adopting this plan for
                    ascertaining the rent of land kept always in tillage, but it would be idle to
                    expect any important benefits from it during such a lease as we have mentioned.
                    In some instances it is the practice to agree for a certain rent in money, which
                    does not vary; and another portion is determined from time to time by the price
                    of corn, the quantity and kinds of the corn only being previously fixed by the
                    lease. This, we think, is a better plan than to make the whole rent vary with
                    the price of corn.</p>
                <p>With regard to much longer leases, this plan will no doubt diminish the evils
                    which we think are inseparable from them, but it cannot possibly reach some of
                    the most considerable. Its utmost effect is to secure to the landholder a rent,
                    which shall in all time to come be an adequate rent, according to the state of
                    the lands and the mode of cultivation known at the date of the lease. But it can
                    make no provision that will apply to the enlargement of the gross produce from
                    the future improvement of the lands themselves, or of the disposable produce
                    from the invention of machinery and other plans for economizing labour. Old
                    corn-rents, therefore, though much higher at present than old money-rents, are
                    seldom or never so high as the rents that could now be paid on a lease of
                    twenty-one years. But, independently of these considerations, which more
                    immediately bear upon the interests of die parties themselves, one insuperable
                    objection to all such leases is, that they partake too much of the nature of
                    entails, and depart too far from that commercial character which is most
                    favourable to the investment of capital, and consequently to the greatest
                    increase of land produce.</p>
                <p>A lease for a term of years is not, however, in all cases a sufficient
                    encouragement to spirited cultivation: its covenants in respect to the
                    management of the lands may be injudicious; the tenant may be so strictly
                    confined to a particular inode of culture, or a particular course of crops, as
                    not to be able to avail himself of the beneficial discoveries which a
                    progressive state of agriculture never fails to introduce. Or, on the other
                    hand, though this is much more rare, the tenant may be left so entirely at
                    liberty, that either the necessity of his circumstances dur.</p>
                <p>ing the currency of the lease, or his interest towards its expiration, may lead
                    him to exhaust the soil, instead of rendering it more productive. When a lease
                    therefore is either redundant or deficient in this respect—when it either
                    permits the lands to be deteriorated or ptevents their improvement—the
                    connection between landlord and tenant is formed upon other views, and regulated
                    by some other principle, than the general one on which we think it should be
                    founded.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the high authority of Adam Smith, restrictive covenants are
                    always necessary to the security of the landlord, and in some cases beneficial
                    also to the tenant. Their expediency cannot well be questioned in those parts of
                    the country where an improved system of agriculture has made little progress. A
                    landholder, assisted by the advice of experienced men in framing these
                    covenants, cannot adopt any easier or less offensive plan for the improvement of
                    his property, and the ultimate advantages of his tenantry. Even in the best
                    cultivated districts, while farms continue to be let to the highest responsible
                    offerers, a few restrictive covenants cannot be dispensed with. The supposed
                    interest of the tenant is too feeble a security for correct management, even
                    during the earlier part of a lease; and in the latter part of it, it is thought
                    to be his interest, in most cases, to exhaust the soil as much as possible, not
                    only for the sake of immediate profit, but frequently in order to deter
                    competitors, and thus to obtain a renewal of his lease at a rent somewhat less
                    than the lands would otherwise bring.</p>
                <p>With tenants at will, and such as hold on short leases, restrictive covenants are
                    more necessary than with tenants on leases of 19 or 20 years; but in many
                    instances they are too numerous and complicated, and sometimes even inconsistent
                    with the best courses of modern husbandry. The great error lies in prescribing
                    rules by which a tenant is positively required to act; not in prohibiting such
                    practices, and such crops, as experience has not sanctioned. The improved
                    knowledge and the liberality of the age have now expunged the most objectionable
                    of these covenants; and throughout whole counties, almost the only restriction
                    in reference to the course of crops is, that the tenant shall not take two
                    culmiferous crops, ripening their seeds, in close succession. This single
                    stipulation, combined with the obligation to consume the straw upon the farm,
                    and to apply to it all the manure made from its produce, is sufficient not only
                    to protect the land from exhaustion, but to insure, in a great measure, its
                    regular cultivation; for half the farm at least must in this case be always
                    under either fallow or green crops. The only other necessary covenant, when the
                    soil is naturally too weak for carrying annual crops without intermission, is,
                    that a certain portion of the land shall be always in grass, not to be cut for
                    hay, but depastured. According to the extent of this will be the interval
                    between the succession of corn crops on the same fields: if it is agreed that
                    half the farm, for instance, shall always be under grass, there can be only two
                    crops of corn from the same field in six years. In this case, not more than
                    two-sixths being in corn, one-sixth in green crops or fallow, and three-sixths
                    in clovers or grasses, it becomes almost impossible to exhaust any soil at all
                    fitted for tillage. There are few indeed that do not gradually become more
                    fertile under this course of cropping. It is sufficiently evident that other
                    covenants are necessary in particular circumstances, such as permission to
                    dispose of straw, hay, and other crops from which manure is made, when a
                    quantity of manure equal to what they would have furnished is got from other
                    places, and a prohibition against converting rich old grazing lands or meadows
                    into corn-lands. In <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034307"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4307-0346"/>this place we speak only of general rules, such as
                    are applicable to perhaps nine-tenths of all the arable land of Britain, and
                    such as are actually observed in our best cultivated counties.</p>
                <p>For the last four years of a lease the same covenants are generally sufficient,
                    only they require to be applied with more precision. Instead of taking it for
                    granted that the proportion of the farm that cannot be under corn will be
                    properly cultivated, from the tenant’s regard to his own <hi rend="subscript">
                    ¾</hi> interest, it becomes necessary to take him bound to this effect in
                    express terms; the object generally being to enable the tenant, upon a new
                    lease, to carry on the cultivation of the lands, as if the former lease had not
                    terminated. What these additional stipulations should be, must depend in part on
                    the season of the year at which the new lease commences, and in part on the
                    course of crops best adapted to the soil and the particular circumstances of
                    every farm.</p>
                <p>3. The enlargement, of farms to such a size as admits of arrangements and
                    machinery for saving labour, is the natural consequence of the progress of
                    agriculture, and the acquisition of capital by cultivators, and becomes, in its
                    turn, the cause of further improvements. We have not room to examine here the
                    various objections to large farms which were urged by Dr Price, Lord Kames, and
                    most of the economical writers of the last oentury. Much stronger reasons,
                    certainly, than any that have been hitherto advanced must be required to justify
                    the interference of the legislature with the rights of the agricultural
                    classes,—with that of a landholder to draw the greatest revenue from his
                    property, and with that of a farmer to extend his concerns as far as his capital
                    and abilities will permit. Even though it should be conceded to Dr Price, that a
                    given extent of land yields a greater produce in the hands of several small
                    farmers than of one great farmer, it still remains to inquire, what part of that
                    produce can be spared for the general consumption,—and whether the labour of
                    these people might not be. employed with more advantage than on such minute
                    portions of land as yield, even in the best seasons, little more than food for
                    their own subsistence. In Britain, of which the families employed in agriculture
                    are to those of the whole population only as 1 to 3, and in which the proportion
                    of lands cultivated, or that may be cultivated, is not four acres to every
                    individual, the great object ought certainly to be, to increase the <hi
                    rend="italic">disposable</hi> produce of the country for the supply of the
                    general population.</p>
                <p>The grand objection to large farms, that they depopulate the country, is not
                    supported by facts. The population of the country has not only greatly increased
                    since the enlargement of farms, but this increase appears to have been little
                    less than that of the town population. The fact is, the increase of the rural
                    population has been in a greater ratio than that of the towns, in those
                    counties, such as Northumberland, where very large farms abound, and where,
                    indeed, as is usually the case, this state of things is combined with a spirited
                    and productive system of agriculture. Even in Lancashire, the ratio of increase
                    in the 10 years from 1801 to 1811 was only two per cent, in favour of the towns;
                    but no one will ascribe this to the enlargement of .farms, The truth seems to
                    be, that wherever agriculture has made the greatest progress, whatever may be
                    the size of farms, the increase of employment has been attended with a
                    corresponding increase of population; and that the ratio of increase has been
                    kept down below that of towns by no other causes than the stationary condition
                    or slow progress of agriculture in some parts,.and the superior allurements of
                    manufactures, and commerce in others.</p>
                <p>It is further to be remarked, that, throughout the whole of the arable districts
                    of Scotland, the number of people is proportionally greater on large than on
                    small farms. The number of hands required on the former is too great to be
                    lodged in the farmer’s own house; and therefore, on all such farms, cottages are
                    built for their residence. These cottages are generally inhabited by married
                    men, whose families find employment in hoeing green crops, and other easy work,
                    from a very early age. In the less-improved counties, on the other hand, where
                    small farms still prevail, unmarried servants are preferred, as, on such farms,
                    there is little or no employment for the families of married servants. Our
                    limits dp not permit us to inquire how far the poor-laws of England operate
                    against the employment of married servants, living in cottages on every farm;
                    but the happy effects of this arrangement are manifest in the south-eastern
                    counties of Scotland, as we shall notice immediately.</p>
                <p>The possession of land is held by some writers to be so important, with a view to
                    the comforts of the labouring classes, as well as to the increase of the rural
                    population, that they have not been contented with objecting to large farms, but
                    have proceeded to recommend what are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cottage-farms,</hi> for country labourers generally. Of this plan we might say
                    at once, that it must be limited everywhere by the demand for labour; and that,
                    wherever such small allotments are required by the state of agriculture, they
                    will gradually be formed from motives of interest, without the necessity of any
                    higher control. They are at this time common in many parts of Britain; and a
                    different system has been established in other parts, for no other reason than
                    because of its superior advantages to all concerned. Yet as cottage-farms bear a
                    very plausible appearance in the eye of speculative men, it seems necessary to
                    offer some further remarks on a question which has been so often agitated.</p>
                <p>If every labourer had a comfortable cottage and four acres of land at .a low
                    rent, as recommended by some of the correspondents of the Board of Agriculture,
                    there is reason to believe that his condition might be much improved for a few
                    years, supposing the demand for labour to continue the same as at present. Even
                    the colonies which this class would every year send forth in quest of new
                    cottages might be supplied for a time; and though the wages of labour would sink
                    very fast, still this premium might enable the labourers to multiply with little
                    interruption for several generations. At last, however, the multiplication of
                    cottage-farms must necessarily stop, and a great proportion of the people,
                    without land and without the means of employment, would either sink into
                    helpless misery, or be driven by despair to the commission of every species of
                    enormity. Such was the state of England at the breaking up of the feudal system,
                    the policy of which also was to increase the number of the people, without
                    regard to the means of their employment; and such, though in a much less degree,
                    is the present state of those parts of the united kingdom in which cottagefarms
                    are the most prevalent.</p>
                <p>The whole question, we think, is capable of being most satisfactorily decided by
                    an appeal to the plain mercantile criterion of rent. If a. hundred labourers,
                    each of them possessing four acres, can pay a higher rent than one farmer can
                    pay for the whole four hundred, buildings, fences, and repairs being estimated,
                    we can see no reason why they should not be preferred; but if-this be not the
                    case, we are greatly at a loss to conceive with what justice landholders can be
                    called upon to submit to sacrifices which no other class of the community is
                    ever expected to make. We might, with just as much reason and jus<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193034320" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4320-0347"/>tice, require a manufacturer
                    to employ a certain number of hands in proportion to the amount of his capital,
                    however unprofitable to him might be their labour.</p>
                <p>In all our best agricultural counties there are two sorts of cottages, occupied
                    by two distinct classes of labourers. Of the first sort are the small
                    agricultural villages, where those mechanics and other labourers reside, who
                    could not find full employment on any one farm. To such men small farms are
                    advantageous, or otherwise, according to the nature and the constancy of their
                    employment.</p>
                <p>The other class of cottagers, to which we have already alluded, are ploughmen and
                    other servants employed throughout the year on a particular farm. To these men
                    small possessions of land are almost as unsuitable as they would be to a country
                    gentleman’s domestics. But a small garden is usually attaohed to each cottage;
                    and they are often allowed to keep a cow as part of their wages, not upon any
                    particular spot of their own, but along with their master’s cows. Their fuel is
                    carried home by their master’s teams; and a part of∙his own field, ready
                    dressed, is assigned them for raising potatoes, flax, or other crops, for their
                    families. Thus, with little risk from the seasons or markets, and without any
                    other demand on their time than a few leisure hours will satisfy, these people
                    enjoy all the advantages which the occupancy of land can confer on a labourer.
                    And there is not a more useful, we may also add, a more comfortable, body of men
                    among the industrious classes of society.</p>
                <p>To give this class of labourers four acres of land along with every cottage,
                    would be to render them bad servants and worse farmers, and either a nuisance to
                    the person on whose farm they reside, or his abject dependents for employment.
                    The only proper residence for men who do not choose to engage, or are not wanted
                    as constant labourers, is in such central agricultural villages as we have just
                    mentioned, and not on separate farms, where they are excluded from the general
                    market for labour.</p>
                <p>But it has been lately suggested, that our poor soils might be cultivated by
                    another description of cottagers, with benefit to the public generally, by the
                    improvement of such lands and the diminution of the poor-rates, as well as with
                    profit to those who advance the necessary capital. As far as there has yet been
                    time to judge, some well-digested and economically executed plans of this kind
                    have been very successful in Holland. The leading points deserving notice in
                    these poor colonies are, the amount of capital sufficient to purchase the land,
                    and to defray the necessary expense of buildings and stock; its division into
                    farms of seven acres; the vigilant superintendence exercised over the colonists,
                    whose operations are almost all performed by manual labour, and much of whose
                    time is employed in collecting manure; their moral and religious instruction;
                    and the surplus produce obtained to replace the original outlay, and afford a
                    permanent clear income or rent in all time coming. The most considerable of
                    these colonies was established at Frederick’s Oord in 1818, at an expense of
                    L.22. 6s. 7d. for every individual; and after a few years’ experience, the
                    annual excess of produce over subsistence for each family was found to be
                    L.8.2s. 4d. after allowing for a rent of 12s. per acre. The whole outlay, it was
                    calculated, would be replaced in sixteen years. The crops raised are barley,
                    clover, potatoes, rye; and about one acre out of the seven is kept permanently
                    in grass. The only sorts of live stock seem to ∙be cows and pigs. About the end
                    of 1825 the number of colonists composing this settlement was 6778, and the
                    population of all the other colonies of this description in Holland was then
                    estimated at more than 20,000.</p>
                <p>The founders of on¢ of these, formed near Antwerp in 1822, soon after made a
                    contract with government to rhain-tain '1000 mendicants for sixteen years, at
                    the rate of 35 guildèrs, or L.2. 18s. 4d., for each per annum; and more recently
                    an individual possessing a portion of heath land near Bruges agreed to take
                    another thousand on the same terms. But for a particular account of these
                    colonies we must refer to Jacob’s <hi rend="italic">Tracts on the Corn-Trade and
                    Com-Laws,</hi> 1828.</p>
                <p>But with regard to the size of farms in the agriculture of this country, we may
                    add, that of all the witnesses examined before the committees of Parliament on
                    the cornlaws, there was only one whose sentiments were opposed to the general
                    feeling of all well-informed men, regarding the advantages that have resulted
                    from the enlargement of farms. We shall therefore content ourselves with
                    noticing what appears to be the natural progress in the size of farms,—the
                    circumstances which prevent any possible enlargement of them from ever becoming
                    injurious to the public,—and the influence which perfect liberty in this respect
                    has exerted in the improvement of our agriculture.</p>
                <p>During the feudal system, that part of an estate which was not cultivated under
                    the direction of the proprietor himself, was let out in small allotments to his
                    vassals, from whom he received military or other services, or a portion of the
                    produce, in return. In those times of turbulence and insecurity, the power of
                    the chief mainly depended on the number of his tenants; and it was therefore his
                    policy to increase them as much as possible, by dividing his land into very
                    small possessions. That they might assist one another in their rural labours,
                    and in repelling the incursions to which they were incessantly exposed, these
                    tenants were collected in a village near the castle of their lord. A certain
                    extent of arable land was appropriated to it, on which they raised corn, and a
                    much larger tract of waste or wood land, where their live stock pastured in
                    common. Spirited cultivation could never be introduced into this system of
                    occupancy; nothing more than the means of subsistence was sought by the
                    tenantry; and power, not revenue, was the great object of the landholder.</p>
                <p>For a long time after the fall of the feudal system, this arrangement continued
                    to prevail with little alteration; its vestiges are still to be traced in every
                    part of Britain; and it exists in several counties, though in a modified form,
                    even at the present time. The common fields and co⅛mons of England, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">infield</hi> and <hi rend="italic">outfield</hi> divisions of
                    Scotland, did not originate in any regal’d for the welfare of the lower classes,
                    to whom the tenancy of land is now thought to be so necessary, but in the
                    anarchy and oppression of those dark ages in which all the landed property of
                    the island was engrossed by a few great barons.</p>
                <p>When these petty sovereigns were at last overthrown, and when commerce and the
                    arts held up to them new objects of desire, and to their depressed tenantry new
                    modes of employment and subsistence, the bond which had hitherto connected the
                    landholder and cultivator became more and more feeble, and it was soon found
                    necessary to establish it upon other foundations than those of feudal protection
                    and dependence. The connection between landlord and tenant came gradually and
                    generally to assume that commercial form, which is at once most conducive to
                    their own interests and to the general welfare.</p>
                <p>One great obstacle to this change was the want of capital ready to be embarked in
                    agricultural pursuits. Under the feudal system there could be little or no
                    accumulation. Property in land was the only means of obtaining the command of
                    labour, and a share of the produce its <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034333"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4333-0348"/>only recompense. Accordingly, upon the breaking up
                    of the feudal system, large tracts were taken into the immediate possession of
                    landholders themselves, because no suitable tenants could be found. The constant
                    superintendence required in cultivating com-lands, as well as the absurd
                    restrictions of those times upon the corntrade, and the constant demand for
                    British wool pn the Continent, occasioned these tracts to be laid to grass and
                    pastured with sheep. Hence the grievous complaints, during two centuries, of the
                    decay of husbandry and farm-houses.</p>
                <p>But this resource of land proprietors was effectual only On soils of an inferior
                    description: on good arable land, the only method by which a part of the produce
                    could reach them in the shape of rent was to enlarge their farms. The old
                    occupiers were too numerous to spare any considerable part of the produce, and
                    generally too indolent and unskilful to make any great exertions to augment it.
                    In these circumstances the landholder must either have virtually abandoned his
                    property, or reduced the number of its inhabitants, who were no longer permitted
                    by Iaw to make him that return which had been the original condition of their
                    tenures. But the population of the towns was now gradually increasing, and it
                    was necessary, for the supply of their wants, as much as for the benefit of the
                    landholders, that a large disposable produce should be obtained from the soil.
                    The measure of enlarging farms was, therefore, in every view, indispensable.
                    Even such of the tenants themselves as it was necessary to displace might have
                    felt but a slight and temporary inconvenience had the change been gradual. Some
                    of them would have found employment in towns, and others as hired labourers and
                    artisans in the country. The dismission of the small tenants seemè, however, to
                    have been the occasion of much misery; for, in the sixteenth century,
                    manufactures and commerce had made comparatively little progress in Britain. In
                    the present times, any length to which the private interest of landholders could
                    operate in this manner would, in a national point of view, be too inconsiderable
                    to deserve notice.</p>
                <p>It is in this way that farms have been enlarged. The most skilful and industrious
                    of these small tenants were naturally preferred, and their possessions
                    afterwards extended as their capital increased. The consequence everywhere has
                    been, a better system of cultivation, affording a higher rent to the land
                    proprietor, and a greater supply of land produce for the general
                    consumption.</p>
                <p>But it is only for a time, and to a very limited extent, that the enlargement of
                    farms can proceed. The interest of the landlord, which gave the first impulse,
                    is ever vigilant to check its progress, when it is attempted to carry the
                    measure beyond due bounds. It is in this that the security of the public
                    consists, if it were ever possible that the public interest should be endangered
                    by the enlargement of farms. Accordingly, in most of our counties, a few
                    tenants, of superior knowledge and capital, have been seen to hold considerable
                    tracts of land, which after a few years were divided into a number of separate
                    farms. The practice of these men is a lesson to their neighbours; and their
                    success never fails to bring forward, at the expiration of their leases, a
                    number of competitors. Whenever skill and capital come to be generally diffused,
                    there can be few instances of very large farms, if a fair competitión be
                    permitted. No individual, whatever may be his fortune and abilities, can then
                    pay so high a rent for several farms, each of them of such a size as to give
                    full room for the use of machinery and other economical arrangements, as can be
                    got from separate tenants. The impossibility of exercising that vigilant
                    superintendence which is so indispensable in agricultural concerns, cannot long
                    be compensated by any advantages which a great farmer may possess. His
                    operations cannot be brought together to one spot, like those of the
                    manufacturer; the materials on which he works are seldom in .the same state for
                    a few days; and his instruments, animated and mechanical, are exposed to a great
                    many accidents, which his judgment and experience must be called forth instantly
                    to repair.</p>
                <p>It has been said, indeed, that a great farmer may pay a higher rent, because he
                    saves the family expenses of a number of small tenants. But from what fund do
                    these tenants maintain their families? It ought to be either from the profits of
                    their capital, or the wages of their labour, or from both combined, and
                    certainly not from the landlord’s just share, in the shape of an abatement of
                    rent. If they cannot pay so high a rent, it must be . because their capital and
                    labour are less productive to the public than those of the large farmer. Such
                    men might, in most cases, be employed with more advantage, even to themselves,
                    in some other profession.</p>
                <p>The various other reasons assigned for the great enlargement of farms are equally
                    nugatory. There is generally no saving to the landlord in buildings and fences;
                    and a very small difference of rent will pay for the trouble of keeping
                    accounts, and settling with twenty tenants instead of one. The fact certainly
                    is, that the principal, if not the only reason, why farms have been enlarged,
                    is, the higher rent paid by their occupiers. To pay this rent, they must bring
                    to market more produce; and this they are enabled to do, by the distribution of
                    their crops and live stock to suitable soils and pastures; by an economical
                    arrangement and regular succession of labour throughout the year; by the use of
                    machinery; and, still more than all, perhaps, by the investment of capital in
                    those permanent improvements which augment both the quantity and value of their
                    products. Rent, in fact, is an almost unerring measure of the amount of - the
                    free produce; and there is no better criterion for determining whether a tract
                    of country be laid out in farms of a proper size, than the amount of the rent
                    paid to its proprietors. Their interest is, in this instance,
                    completely-identified with t⅛t of the great body of the people.</p>
                <p>If we examine the various sizes of farms in those districts where the most
                    perfect freedom exists and the best management prevails, we shall find them
                    determined, with few exceptions, by the degree of superintendence which they
                    require. Hence pastoral farms are the largest; next, such as are composed both
                    of grazing and <hi rend="underline">tillag</hi> e lands; then, such rich soils
                    as carry cultivated crops every year; and, finally, the farms near large towns,
                    where the grower of corn gradually gives way to the market-gardener, cultivating
                    his little spot by manual labour. The hills of the squth of Scotland are·
                    distributed into farms of the first class; the counties of Berwick and Roxburgh
                    into those of the second; and the smaller farms of the Lothians and of the Carse
                    of Gowrie, where there seems to be no want of capital for the management of
                    large farms, are a sufficient proof of the general principle which determines
                    the size of farms. ∙</p>
                <p>It must readily appear from these remarks, in what manner the enlargement of
                    farms, or rather the absence of all restraint upon the transactions of the
                    landholder and farmer, has promoted the improvement of our agriculture. To
                    confine the practice of this important art to the manual labour of men in a
                    state of poverty and dependence, would be no less injudicious, and much more
                    ruinous in a national point of view, than to destroy all the extraordinary
                    inventions for saving labour in our manufactures. The effects of capital and
                    machinery are the same in both <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034346"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4346-0349"/>departments. But no man of education, and in
                    circumstances much above the condition of a common labourer, would ever engage
                    in farming, if his concerns could be no farther extended than to fifty or one
                    hundred acres held at rack-rent; and on such farms there is no room for the most
                    economical machinery,—for convertible husbandry, by which land is preserved in
                    its highest fertility,—or, indeed, for any of those arrangements which approach
                    in their effects to the division of labour in other arts.</p>
                <p>Besides those general causes of the improvement of the agriculture nf Britain,
                    arising from the division of landed property,—the existence of a distinct class
                    of professional farmers, whose rights are secured by leases, and whose exertions
                    are stimulated by a rent settled by competition,—and the opportunities held out
                    for the investment of capital as far as it promises to be profitable,—there are
                    several others of a more limited or temporary nature, but which it is only
                    necessary barely to mention. The most important of these is the extent of the
                    British market, which for many years has required more corn than was grown in
                    the country. The gradual rise of price, which was the necessary consequence of
                    this, and still more the enormous prices during the late war, in which foreign
                    supplies were obtained with difficulty or altogether withheld, have contributed
                    in no small degree to the improvement of our own ample resources. This has been
                    further promoted by the facility and expedition with which commodities of every
                    kind are transported by means of canals, roads, and railways. We may add, that
                    the liberal accommodations afforded by the banking establishments during the
                    suspension of cash payments enabled British farmers to operate upon extensive
                    wastes, of which the improvement must be advantageous in a national point of
                    view, though, in consequence of the change that has taken place since the peace,
                    it may not in many cases have been profitable to individuals.</p>
                <p>The progress of a correct system of agriculture is generally allowed to have been
                    more rapid in Scotland than in England; the effects, at least, have been more
                    conspicuous. Not only the rents paid in Scotland, but the actual produce per
                    acre, and still moré the disposable produce, seem to be greater than in England,
                    wherever the comparison is made with land of a similar quality, and with an
                    allowance for the difference in climate and markets. The remark naturally leads
                    us to advert to some circumstances which seem materially to impede the
                    agricultural improvement of the country, particularly the southern part of it;
                    arid with one or two observations on this head we shall conclude this
                    article.</p>
                <p>The low state of agriculture in many parts of Britain, with the advance in the
                    price of corn, on the one hand, and the abundance of capital displayed in the
                    manufactures and commerce of the country, on the other, are circumstances
                    sufficient to convince every reflecting mind that there is no want either of
                    means or of inducements to the improvement of our territory. It is impossible,
                    indeed, to travel through, the country in any direction, without feeling a
                    strong conviction that there must be some serious obstacles to the investment of
                    capital iri agriculture. The circumstances which seem to have the most weight in
                    determining men of capital to engage in any particular profession, are, the
                    secùrity and productiveness of that capital, the power of transferring it, and
                    the degree of estimation in which the profession is held by the public. To the
                    absence of these essential requisites we must ascribe the backward state of this
                    art, notwithstanding all the other motives, both of a public and private nature,
                    which have long existed for it’s advancèmént.</p>
                <p>To the class of drawbacks upon agriculture, and impediments ' to ' its
                    improvement, belong tithes, poor-rates, payments in the shape of fines, and
                    services exacted by the lords of manors; entails; tenancy at will, or on very
                    short leases; unfair restrictions on the tenant as to the disposal of his lease,
                    and as to the management of the lands during its currency; the game-laws; and
                    the complicated regulations under which commons and common fields are
                    cultivated, and the great expense required to place them in a state of
                    severalty.</p>
                <p>It appears that nearly three-fourths of the lands of England and Wales are
                    exposed to claims which wrest from the husbandman one-tenth of the gross produce
                    of his labour and capital, and this whether the remainder of the produce be or
                    be not sufficient for his remuneration. Though no rent were paid for poor soils,
                    this burden alone would effectually prohibit their correct cultivation; and even
                    in the case of rich soils, tithes diminish the rent so considerably as to make
                    it the interest of landholders, in many parts of England, to restrain their
                    tenants from converting grass-lands into tillage; that is, from placing them
                    under the most productive management for the community, both in regard to the
                    supply of food and of employment-</p>
                <p>To the enlightened inquirer it must appear abundantly clear, that all plans for
                    the extension and improvement of British agriculture must prove ineffectual so
                    long as these capital obstacles are left untouched; and that their removal is
                    all that need be done, and all that ought to be done by a wise government, for
                    securing an abundant supply of the first necessaries of life. Let all land be
                    held and occupied in severalty; let it be exempted from all indefinite
                    exactions, particularly such as diminish or altogether absorb the just returns
                    of capital and industry; let the connection between the land proprietor and the
                    farmer be everywhere formed upon equitable principles, to the exclusion of all
                    remnants of feudal ideas, all notions of favour and dependence, and all
                    obligations that do not appear in the lease itself, or are not imposed by the
                    general principles of law; let the rights of a tenant be so far enlarged as that
                    he may be enabled to withdraw his capital by a transference , of his lease, and
                    to regulate the succession to it after his death; then there can be little doubt
                    that a large part of the disposable capital of the nation, now embarked in much
                    less profitable pursuits, would of its own accord turn towards the improvement
                    of our lands, and thus furnish employment and subsistence for our population,
                    secure from the caprice of fashion and the rivalry and jealousy of other
                    countries. (<hi rend="smallcaps"> d.</hi>)</p>

                    bird’s-eye view of the machine), that the horses are yoked one on each side of a
                    pole, which runs back from the frame of the carriage. The person who drives the
                    horses and directs the machine walks behind, having command of the horses by a
                    set of common plough-reins, and directing the machine by a hold of the end of
                    the pole. The horses draw from a cross bar at the end of the pole by common
                    plough chains, the back-weight of the carriage resting on their common
                    cart-saddles by means of an apparatus such as is used in curricles. On the fore
                    part of the carriage is hung a horizontal circular cutter, surmounted by a drum,
                    the blade of the cutter projecting ð½ inches beyond the periphery of the lower
                    end of the drum. When the carriage is moving forward, a rapid rotatory motion is
                    communicated to the cutter and drum, from the motion of the carriage-wheels, by
                    means of a series of wheels, pinions, and shafts. The diameter of the cutter
                    projects beyond the carriage-wheels on each side, so as to cut a breadth
                    sufficient to allow the carriage and horses to pass along without risk of
                    treading down the uncut corn. The corn being cut by the rapid motion of the
                    cutter, the lower ends rest upon the blade of the cutter, and the upper parts
                    coming in contact with the drum, the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034372"

                    the heads fall outwards, the stalks lying parallel to each other, and at nearly
                    a right angle to the line of motion of the machine. The corn lying thus in
                    regular rows, is easily gathered into sheaves by the hand, or by a rake, fork,
                    or other convenient instrument, and is bound in the usual way.</p>

                    yoked to the cross bar, D, by common plough-chains. The breeching-chains are
                    linked to the draught-chains, and a breast-chain, which passes through a ring
                    made fast to the <hi rend="italic">kames,</hi> is drawn up to an eye at N. Fig.

                    slight springs to keep the catches in gear. By this means the wheels carry the
                    axle in revolution with them when the carriage is moved forward, but move, round
                    upon it when the carriage is drawn in a contrary direction. This construction is
                    necessary, to facilitate the turning of the machine. The axle moves in two
                    cast-iron seats with caps, on which the frame of the carriage rests. A wheel, 0
                    (fig. 2), of 24 teeth of 1½ inch pitch, works into an intermediate wheel of the
                    same dimensions. This wheel is in gear of a pinion of 12 teeth, fast on the end
                    of the cross shaft Q. At the centre of this shaft, two bevelled wheels, R, with
                    long sockets, are fitted loose. These wheels have each 28 teeth of 1½ inch
                    pitch: in the bosom of these is a double reversing catch, which will be best
                    explained by reference to fig. 3, which is a longitudinal section of the cross
                    shaft with the wheels and catch; a, the shaft; <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the
                    pinion; <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the bevelled wheels, R, of fig. 2, having long
                    sockets fitted loose on the shaft; <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> a double catch,
                    which is movable longitudinally on the shaft, but is carried in revolution with
                    it, by means of the feather, <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> upon the shaft, fitted
                    into a corresponding groove n the catch. This catch can be put into gear of
                    either, if the wheels at pleasure, by means of the lever, «.(fig. 2), movable on
                    a stool at T, and kept to its place when set, by notches in an iron stand at U.
                    Both of the wheels are constantly in gear of a pinion of 14 teeth, V (fig. 2),
                    and/ (fig. 3). By thus reversing the gearing, the cutter and drum can be made to
                    revolve to the right or left, and consequently will throw the cut corn to either
                    side of the machine at pleasure. On the opposite end of the shaft, W (fig. 2),
                    on which the pinion V is fixed, is a bevelled wheel X of 28 teeth, in gear of a
                    pinion of 14 teeth on the upright axle, (fig. 7 and 8). The velocity is so
                    raised by these wheels and pinions, that the. cutter makes 128 revolutions per
                    minute when the machine moves at the rate of 2½ miles per hour, the edge of the
                    cutter passing through 32 feet per second. The upright spindle, shown in fig. 1
                    and 8, has three bearings, one in a brass bush fixed in an iron stay-frame, <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>; a second bearing in a wooden bush with a cap on the front
                    of the cross bar at <hi rend="italic">c</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a third
                    in a socket resting on the small wheels, <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> These wheels
                    serve to keep the cutter always at an equal height from the ground. The
                    particular construction of these wheels, with that of the frame and socket, will
                    be better understood by reference to fig. 7 and 8. Fig. 8, a perpendicular
                    section of the foot of the upright spindle and socket; <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    the spindle; <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the socket; <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> a
                    groove in the spindle, into which the points of two screw pins, <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> passing through the sides of the socket, are fitted. These
                    are necessary to keep the spindle in its place, and to bear up the wheels when
                    the spindle is raised. Fig. 7 is a bird’s-eye view of the wheels and carriage,
                    with a transverse section of the socket and spindle; α, the wheels, 14inches in

                    rend="italic">;</hi> the bar <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is one inch square, having
                    a long ruff’ at <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> which is turned and fitted to the eye,
                    <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> of the socket, fig. 8. The bar is bent so as to pass
                    close under the cutter, and runs up to the pole. This bar is necessary to
                    relieve the point of the upright spindle of the resistance opposed to the wheels
                    in moving along. The cutter can be placed higher or lower on the spindle, so as
                    to cut the straw to any height, by means of a series of holes through the
                    spindle; pins passing through holes in the sockets of the arms, and the most
                    suitable of the series. The cutter can also be screwed to any height from the
                    ground, from two to eighteen inches, by means of an iron lever, on the point of
                    which is a brass socket, in which the upright spindle runs, and on which it
                    rests. The lever is hung by an iron chain passing over a pulley at ∕ and joining
                    two iron rods at <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> which connect it with a screw box, I,
                    which is moved backwards and forwards, by turning round the screw, <hi
                    rend="italic">m.</hi> To the end of this screw is connected an iron rod, which
                    runs along the upper side of the pole to a bearing at <hi rend="italic">h.</hi>
                    At the end of this rod is a winch, <hi rend="italic">ο,</hi> of 9 inches radius,
                    by which the person who guides the machine can turn round the screw, and so
                    raise or lower the cutter at pleasure. This is principally of use to raise the
                    cutter when passing over a deep furrow, or in going from one field to another. P
                    is a hollow piece of wood put upon the end of the rod, by which the man holds
                    with one hand when guiding the machine. In most cases the cutters will cut ½ of
                    an acre without requiring to be sharpened, which can be done in two minutes by a
                    common scythestone, two of which are conveniently carried in two leather
                    pockets, <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> fig. 2. When it is necessary to go with the
                    machine to a distance, the upright spindle, with the drum and cutter, are taken
                    from their place, and placed on the top of the carriage; and the small wheels
                    are drawn close up to the cross bar. The draught bar, D, is taken from the end
                    of the pole and placed ncar the frame <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034385"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4385-0352"/> of the carriage. The horses are turned to draw
                    from it, and can in this way travel any distance, and over any roads.</p>

                    water, with the new-invented apparatus for yoking horses.</p>
                <p>A, the perpendicular axle (see A, fig. 2), in which are fixed the arms or levers
                    D, that carry the great wheel B; and upon these arms are fixed the limbers, by
                    which the cattle pull the machine when threshing. No. 1 and 2 represent two
                    frames fixed in the axle A, and supported by the arms D; upon these frames are
                    placed the two shifting-blocks, as 3 4 and 5 6, which have liberty to move or
                    slide, either inwards to the axle or outwards from it. In each of these
                    shifting-blocks are placed two running sheeves or whorles. F F, an endless chain
                    or rope, which passes over the two sheeves that are placed in the
                    shifting-blocks at the ends 4 and 5. By this chain the two blocks are so
                    connected, that if the one is pulled outwards from the axle A, the other is
                    pulled inwards alternately. 15 and 15 are two sheeves, by which the chain F F is
                    kept clear of the axle A when turning round. Y Y are two ropes that pass oyer
                    the sheeves which are placed in the shifting-blocks at their ends 3 and 6: upon
                    each end of these ropes is fastened a small block, in which are placed the
                    running sheeves 7, 8, 9, 10, and over these sheeves pass the double ropes, by
                    which the horses pull when working this machine, <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, d,
                    e,f</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g, h,</hi> represent the limbers or ears, fixed
                    by screw-bolts on the arms D D D D (see D D D in fig. 2), and in each of these
                    ears are placed two running sheeves, by which the ropes are conveyed to the line
                    of draught (see 1 and 2 in fig. 2); each horse is yoked to the ends of the
                    chains or ropes, as at 11, 12, 13, and 14, these ropes passing over the sheeves
                    7, 8, 9, 10, which turn on their axis. By this means the draught will always
                    press the collars equally upon the horses’ shoulders; and though they are
                    walking in a circle, yet the strains of the draught must press fairly or equally
                    on their shoulders, without twisting their body to either side. This advantage
                    cannot be obtained in the common way of yoking horses in a threshing-machine,
                    unless the draught-chains on each side of the horse be made in exact proportion
                    in length to the diameter of the circle in which he walks, or the chain next to
                    the centre of the walk made a little shorter than the one farthest from it,
                    which is often neglected; but in this way of yoking the horses the strain of the
                    draught will naturally press equally on his shoulders when pulling, which of
                    course must be less severe on the animal when walking in a circle.</p>
                <p>Thus, the draught-chains, or ropes, being all connected by means of the endless
                    chain F F, and the shifting blocks, with their sheeves, having liberty to move
                    either inwards to the axle A, or recede from it, it is apparent, that if one of
                    the horses relax, the other horse will immediately press the collar hard to his
                    shoulders, and excite him to exertion. For instance, if the horse hooked to the
                    draught-chains at 12 were to relax, then the one yoked at 14 would instantly
                    take up his chain, and pull the collar close to his shoulders; so that the horse
                    at 12 must either exert himself or be pulled backward. And, supposing the horses
                    at 12 and 14 were both to relax, then the exertions of the horses at 11 and 13
                    would immediately pull the shifting block from 5 towards 3, and of course press
                    the collars hard on the horses at 12 and 14, which would tend to drag them back
                    ward, and by this means push them to exertion. Thus, the horses being all
                    connected by the draught-chains and shifting-blocks, their exertions are all
                    united completely round the circle, so as to form one power applied to the
                    machine, instead of as many independent powers as there are horses employed when
                    yoked in the common way. It may sometimes be convenient to employ fewer horses
                    than the whole number of which the machine admits. This is easily accomplished;
                    for example, were the horse at 12 to be left out, then the two chains must be
                    fastened or tied to the ears <hi rend="italic">c d,</hi> and thus the horse at
                    12 is left out of the circle, whilst the horses at 11, 13, and 14, are
                    nevertheless still united, so as to make one combined power act on the machine.
                    This apparatus is the invention of Walter Samuel, an ingenious blacksmith at
                    Niddry, in the county of Linlithgow. C C C C C C represent the pillars which

                    being smooth, and of the other fluted, or having small teeth its whole length,
                    in order to keep hold of the unthreshed corn; and as they revolve on their
                    pivots, they feed the grain regularly forward, to receive the strokes from the
                    threshers, by which the corn is detached from the straw. T T represent the axle

                    gudgeon P of the threshing-drum R; from this sheeve passes the belt or band 14,
                    over the sheeve 24, which is fixed upon the iron spindle Y, attached to the axle
                    of the fans W: by this means the fans arc driven with such velocity as to blow
                    all the chaff and light refuse away from the grain. 19 represents the
                    water-wheel, placed on the axle G G: upon the circumference of this wheel are
                    fixed the toothed segments 20, that turn the wheel 21, which is fastened on the
                    axle H; so that motion is by this means carried from the water-wheel to the
                    threshing-drum; and when there is not a sufficient quantity of water, then the
                    horses can be applied to drive· the machine. In this ease the frame or bearer
                    that carries the wheel 19, must either be dropt a little down, so as , its teeth
                    may be clear of the wheel 21, or else one of the segments 20 taken off, to allow
                    the wheel 21 to run freely. But when there is plenty of water for turning the
                    machinery, then the wheel 11 must be raised up clear of the wheel B, which is
                    easily done by turning round the screw-bolts 25, and raising the bearer 26 a
                    little upwards", until the teeth of the wheel 11 be fully clear of the wheel B,
                    so as it may revolve freely when the wheel 21 is turned, by the teeth of the
                    segments 20 acting upon its teeth, , Thus’ the threshing may be carried on
                    without interruption, either with water or horses separately, or a small
                    quantity of water may be applied to assist the horses at any time, when ή

                    the other half, of the wheel, being quite empty, give very little resistance to

                    sheeve No. 6, which is fixed upon the iron spindle Z: by this means the balls in
                    the frame are driven round. This frame, having movable joints at F F F, has
                    liberty to yield; so that when the wind is very strong, the vans of course must
                    move with too great velocity, and be apt to break some part of the machine. But
                    by this quick motion the balls are thrown outwards from the spindle Z, by which
                    the teethed rod G is pulled downwards, and turns the wheel No. 8, upon the axle
                    of which is fixed a pinion, that drives the wheel No. 9; and upon its axle is
                    fixed the pinion No. 10. This pinion acts on the teeth of an iron rod, that goes
                    through a hole in the centre of the axle B, to N; this rod having teeth also at
                    Μ, which act on the teeth of the segments PPM, that have liberty to move on
                    their pivots at K, so that when the rod Μ is pushed by the pinion either outward

                    end of the iron rods P P is hooked to these segments, and their other ends
                    attached to the frames X X, by this means the frames are moved either inward to
                    the axle B or outwards from it; and as the pivots of the cylinders on which the
                    sails are rolled turn in these frames, of course they are either rolled on or

                <p>Figs. 6 and 7. <hi rend="italic">The Odometer.</hi></p>
                <p>The wheel A is made of light iron, and measures two yards in circumference, being
                    divided by six spokes into feet. One spoke must be painted white.</p>
                <p>The handle B is divided at C like a fork, and embraces each end of the axis by
                    its elasticity. Through the axis is a hole, into which the end H of the
                    way-wiser fits, and is held fast by a nut D.</p>
                <p>The way-wiser consists of a frame F G, F being hollow to receive a perpetual
                    screw H, a part of which is visible near the index Μ. At the other end of the
                    screw is a nut I, which keeps it in its place. The screw turns two brass
                    concentric cogged wheels K and L; K conceals the scale of L, except where a
                    piece is cut out, leaving an index at the beginning of the scale of K, and
                    which, in the drawing, points to 78 of L.</p>
                <p>The scale of K is numbered towards the left, and that of L to the right.</p>
                <p>The wheel K has 100 eogs or teeth, and L 101; consequently, as the same endless
                    screw turns both wheels, it is evident that when K has made a complete
                    revolution of 100 teeth, L will also have made a revolution of 100 teeth; and
                    the index of K will point to 1 of L, because L has 101 teeth. After a second
                    revolution, it will point to 2, and so on; the number it points to marking the
                    number of revolutions, each revolution showing 100 turns of the iron wheel
                    A.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, A measures six feet, or 1 turn; K 100 times 6 feet, or 600 feet, or
                    1 revolution; and L 101 times 600 feet, or 60,600 feet, equal to nearly 11½
                    English miles, the range of the instrument.</p>
                <p>880 turns of this wheel make a mile.</p>
                <p>It is advisable always to commence with the way-wiser set at 0 or zero. To do
                    this, take out the screw in the centre, when the brass wheels K and L can both
                    be set at zero, and the screw replaced. Set the wheel A upon the ground, with
                    the white spoke undermost, and fix the way-wiser into the wheel by means of the
                    nut D, always observing to put it on the left side, as shown in the plate at
                    E.</p>
                <p>At any period of measuring, you can tell exactly how far you have gone, and
                    proceed without again setting the way-wiser at 0.</p>
                <p>Suppose, as in the drawing, the spoke No. 2 at the ground, the index Μ pointing
                    at 26 of K, and the index of K pointing at 78 of L; then the distance measured
                    is 7826 turns of A and two feet; and as A measures two yards, 7826 × 2 = 15652
                    yards, to which add the two feet.</p>
                <p>In reading off, particular care should be taken always to read the large figures
                    (viz. those on the wheel L) first, and afterwards to add the small figures (viz.
                    those on the wheel K); and if the figures on K amount to less than 10, a 0 must
                    be prefixed, so that K shall always show two figures: for instance, L being at
                    46, and K at 4, the sum is 4604. The easiest way to guard against error, is'to
                    read 46 and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034424" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4424-0355"

                    water-wheel, A A, is represented as being of the over-shot kind; it is included
                    between the two walls, B B, upon the top of which, the pivots or gudgeons of its
                    axis are supported in brass bearings. A square formed on the end of one of the
                    gudgeons is received into a square socket at the end of the connecting axis, D,
                    which communicates the motion to the lowest, F, of the two rollers, the latter
                    having a similar square on the end of its axis, to be received into the socket
                    at the end of the connecting axis, D. The rollers are supported by a wooden
                    frame, G G. Two iron frames, H H, are bolted down upon it, having grooves or
                    openings in them, of nearly the whole length, to receive the brasses for the
                    pivots of the rollers, as shown in fig. <hi rend="italic">2.</hi> At the upper
                    ends of these grooves are screws, <hi rend="italic">h h,</hi> by which the
                    rollers can be made to act at a greater or less distance from each other, as the
                    size of the bones which are to pass through them may require. Two pinions, <hi
                    rend="italic">k l,</hi> arc placed upon the ends of the axles of the two
                    rollers, and by their teeth acting together, they compel the two rollers to
                    accompany each other. The surfaces of the rollers are filled with indentations
                    and strong teeth, which penetrate and break the bones to pieces. This is
                    accomplished by employing separate cast-iron wheels, placed side by side upon an
                    axis, to compose the rollers; the wheels have coarse teeth, similar to those of
                    a saw or ratchet-wheel; each wheel of the lower roller, F, is an inch thick, and
                    they are placed at distances of an inch and a half asunder, having circles of
                    hard wood or iron placed between them, which are two inches less in diameter.
                    Thus they leave grooves between the toothed wheels, which have the effect of
                    rendering the teeth upon the surface of the roller insulated. The wheels of the
                    opposite roller, E, are 1½ inch wide, and the spaces between them only 1 inch;
                    and the two are so situated with respect to each other, that the teeth upon one
                    are opposite to the spaces between the teeth of the other, as is clearly
                    explained by the figure. A hopper, 11, is fixed above the machine, over the
                    rollers, and into this the bones are filled, so that they rest upon the two
                    rollers, and are drawn in by their motion, the teeth penetrating and breaking
                    every piece, however large or solid it may be. The bones should be supplied
                    rather gradually to the machine at first, to avoid choking it, and the rollers
                    should then be adjusted to a considerable distance asunder; but when the bones
                    have once passed through in this way, the rollers are screwed closer by the
                    screws, <hi rend="italic">h lι,</hi> and the fragments ground a second time.
                    This will generally be found sufficient, as it is not advisable to reduce the
                    bones to a state of extreme division. The pinions,must have deep cogs, to enable
                    them to take deep hold of each other, when the rollers are set at only half an
                    inch distance to grind fine, and without the cogs being liable to slip when the
                    centres arc separated, so far as to leave a space of 1 inch, or 1½ inch, between
                    the rollers, for the passage of the large bones the first time. The rollers will
                    act most effectually if the different wheels are fixed upon their axles in such
                    a position that the teeth will not correspond, or form lines parallel to the
                    axes, and then no piece of bone can escape without being broken by some of the
                    teeth. The bones which have passed through the rollers slide down the inclined
                    board, R, and collect at the bottom in a large heap. When all the stock of bones
                    is thus coarsely broken, a labourer takes them up in a shovel, and throws them
                    again to the hopper, to be ground a second time.</p>
                <p>Fig. 3. <hi rend="italic">A Machine for grinding Potato-flour.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> A, a cylinder covered with tin-plates, pierced with holes,
                    so as to leave a rough surface, in the same manner as the graters used for
                    nutmegs, &amp;c. but the holes in this are larger. This cylinder is situate
                    beneath a hopper, B, into which the potatoes arc thrown, and thence admitted
                    into a kind of trough, C, where they are forced against the cylinder, which, as
                    it revolves, grinds the potatoes to a pulp. Motion is given to the machine by a
                    handle fixed upon the end of the axis of the grating cylinder, A; and on the
                    opposite extremity of this axis is a fly-wheel, D, to regulate and equalize the
                    movement. The potatoes, when put into the hopper, press by their weight upon the
                    top of the cylinder; and, as it revolves, they are in part grated away. On one
                    side of the lower part of the hopper is an opening, closed or opened, more or
                    less at pleasure, by a slider, <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and the degree of opening which this has regulates the passage of the potatoes
                    from the hopper into the trough, C. This is as wide as the length of the
                    cylinder, and has a concave board, R, fitted into it, which slides backwards and
                    forwards by the action of levers, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fixed to an axis
                    extended across the frame of the machine; and a lever, N, is fixed upon this
                    axis, and carries a weight which acts upon the board, R, by means of the levers,
                    to force or press forwards the potatoes contained in the trough C against the
                    cylinder, and complete the grating of them into a pulp. The tin-plate covering
                    the cylinder is of course pierced from the inside outwards, and the bur or rough
                    edge left round each hole forms an excellent rasping surface.</p>
                <p>Fig. 4. <hi rend="italic">A Potato-Scoop.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> A, the end
                    of the handle, having a round stem, which passes through a piece of metal, D,
                    and has then a semicircular knife or cutter, E, fixed to it. This is sharp on
                    both edges, and turns upon a pivot, fitted in a similar piece of brass to D,
                    which, as well as the latter, is formed out of a piece of plate, B C. This forms
                    a shield to hold the instrument firm upon the potato, by placing the thumb of
                    the left hand upon the shield, B C, and pressing the points of D into the root,
                    which is grasped in the hand; then, by turning the handle half round with the
                    right hand, the semicircular knife makes a sweep, and cuts out a piece or set,
                    which is a segment of a small sphere. Fig. 5 is an end view of the shield, B C,
                    and the knife, E, also the piece of brass, D, placed upon the surface of a
                    potato, F, in which the dotted line F G shows the piece the knife will cut out
                    by its motion. The only attention necessary in the use of this tool is, that it
                    be placed upon the potato, with the eye or part from whence the shoot springs in
                    the centre of the semicircle of the knife, when it is laid flat upon the root.
                    The advantage of this scoop, besides that it is very quick in its operation, is,
                    that the pieces, being all of one exact size, which is about one inch diameter,
                    they can be planted, by a bean-barrow or drill-machine, with much less labour
                    and more accuracy than by the hand.</p>
