                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">AMBOISE</label>, a town of France, in the former province of
                    Touraine, now the department of the Indre and Loire, seated at the confluence of
                    the rivers Loire and Masse. The town is the capital of a district, and has been
                    rendered famous in history by the conspiracy of the Protestants in 1560, which
                    opened the fatal wars of religion in France. The castle is situated on a craggy
                    rock, extremely difficult of access, and the sides of which are almost
                    perpendicular. At its foot flows the Loire, which is divided into two streams by
                    a small island. To this fortress the duke of Guise, when he expected an
                    insurrection among the Huguenots, removed Francis II. as to a place of perfect
                    security. Only two detached parts of the ancient castle now remain, one of which
                    was constructed by Charles VIII. and the other by Francis I. The former of these
                    princes was born and died at Am-boise. The town is situated in long. 0. 34. E.

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amboise,</hi><hi rend="italic">Francis d',</hi> son of a
                    surgeon to Charles IX. of France. He very early obtained the patronage of that
                    prince, and was supported by his liberality in the prosecution of his studies at
                    the university of Navarre, where he devoted his talents to rhetoric and
                    philosophy with great assiduity and success. His eloquence and extensive
                    information raised him in 1572 to the place of solicitor of the French nation.
                    He afterwards applied to the study of the law, and became one of the most
                    accomplished advocates of the parliament of Paris. He was next advanced to be
                    counsellor in the parliament of Bretagne, and afterwards to be a master of
                    requests and counsellor of state. He visited different countries, and published
                    the history of his travels, with several poetical pieces. He prefixed an
                    apologetical preface to the edition of Abelard’s works in 1616, and with much
                    industry collected many of his manuscripts. His brother Adrian rose to
                    considerable consequence in the church; and his brother James was not less
                    eminent as a physician.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amboise,</hi><hi rend="italic">George d',</hi> a French
                    cardinal and minister of state, was born in the year 1460. His father was a
                    descendant of the renowned house of Amboise, and, through the influence of his
                    powerful connections, he beheld the path of church preferment open before his
                    son; therefore he destined him to the clerical order. In these sanguine
                    expectations he was not disappointed; for he <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037557"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-7557-0596"/>had sufficient influence to procure for him the
                    bishopric of Montauban at the early age of fourteen. Louis XI. appointed him one
                    of his almoners; and, in the course of political events, he became strongly
                    attached to the duke of Orleans, and suffered imprisonment in his cause. When
                    this prince, however, had regained his favour at court, he was elevated to the
                    archbishopric of Narbonne. After he had remained there for some time, he changed
                    that station for the archbishopric of Rouen. When the duke of Orleans was
                    governor of Normandy, he made him lieutenant-general; and in that situation he
                    was of essential service to the province, in restoring justice and order. When
                    the duke of Orleans became Louis XII. Amboise was suddenly raised to the
                    elevated station of cardinal and prime minister. The same regard to equity which
                    characterized his conduct when lieutenant-general, induced him to diminish the
                    imposts, which rendered him very popular as first minister of France. In 1499,
                    by his advice, the king undertook the conquest of the Milanese, and, on their
                    revolt, the prime minister was sent to quell the rebellion. The great confidence
                    which Louis had reposed in him induced the pope to make him his legate in
                    France; and, in that station, he piously laboured to reform the ecclesiastical
                    orders. He enforced his doctrine by precept, and not only set them an example of
                    holding only one benefice at a time, but also devoted two thirds of its revenue
                    to the poor, and to the repair of religious edifices. According to his own
                    account, he was ambitious of the papal chair “merely for the purpose of
                    effecting the reformation of abuses and the correction of manners.” It is
                    reported that, upon the death of Pius HL, he would have been elected pope had he
                    not been deceived by the Italian cardinals. Disappointed in his views with
                    regard to the papal honours, he persuaded his master to declare war against the
                    Venetians, to whose influence he attributed his failure. But this imprudent
                    undertaking was suddenly interrupted; for, in the prosecution of his journey for
                    the Venetian war, he was seized with an illness, and confined in the city of
                    Lyons. Affliction rouses the reflecting powers of the mind, and calls to
                    remembrance the past actions of life. From the consciousness of his past errors
                    and faults he was induced to express his contrition to a brother of the
                    infirmary who attended him at the convent of the Celestines. In the year 1510,
                    and in the 50th of his age, he breathed his last in that place. Industry,
                    steadiness, and good intention, characterized his conduct as a prime minister.
                    He shone with peculiar brightness as a man of literature. By his liberality and
                    patronage the arts and sciences flourished under his administration. It may be
                    proper to add, that, assisted by some of the ablest lawyers in the kingdom, he
                    formed a code of laws to reform the reigning abuses in the nation. Thus, by
                    steadily pursuing the general welfare, he obtained the appellation of the
                    “father of the people.”</p>
