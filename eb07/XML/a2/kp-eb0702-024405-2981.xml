                <p><label type="entry">AGESILAUS</label>, king of the Lacedemonians, the son of
                    Archidamus, was raised to the throne in opposition to the superior claim of his
                    nephew Leotychides. As soon as he came to the throne, he advised the
                    Lacedemonians to anticipate the king of Persia, who was making great
                    preparations for war, and to attack him in his own dominions. He was himself
                    chosen for this expedition, and gained so many advantages over the enemy, that
                    if the league which the Athenians and the Thebans formed against the
                    Lacedemonians had not obliged him to return home, he would have carried his
                    victorious arms into the very heart of the Persian empire. He gave up, however,
                    all these triumphs readily, to come to the succour of his country, which he
                    happily relieved by his victory over the allies in Boeotia. He obtained another
                    near Corinth; but, to his great mortification, the Thebans afterwards gained
                    several over the Lacedemonians. These misfortunes at first raised a clamour
                    against him. He had been sick during the first advantages which the enemy
                    gained; but as soon as he was able to act in person, his valour and prudence
                    prevented the Thebans from reaping the advantages of their victories; so that it
                    was generally believed, had he been in health at the beginning, the
                    Lacedemonians would have sustained no losses, and that all would have been lost
                    had it not been for his assistance. It cannot be denied but he loved war more
                    than the interest of his country required; for if he could have lived in peace,
                    he would have saved the Lacedemonians several losses, and they would not have
                    been engaged in many enterprises which in the end contributed much to weaken
                    their power. He died in the third year of the 104th Olympiad, being the 84th
                    year of his age and 41st of his reign, and was succeeded by his son Archidamus.
                    Agesilaus would never suffer any picture or sculpture to be made of him, and
                    prohibited it also by his will. This he is supposed to have done from a
                    consciousness of his own deformity; for he was of a short stature, and lame of
                    one foot, so that strangers used to despise him at the first sight. Agesilaus
                    was extremely fond of his children, and would often amuse himself by joining in
                    their diversions. One day when he was surprised riding upon a stick with them,
                    he said to a person who had seen him in this posture, “Forbear talking of it
                    till you are a father.”</p>
