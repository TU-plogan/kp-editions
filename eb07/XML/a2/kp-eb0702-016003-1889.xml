                <p><label type="entry">ADOPTION</label>, an act by which any one takes another into
                    his family, owns him for his son, and appoints him for his heir.</p>
                <p>The custom of adoption was very common among the ancient Greeks and Romans; yet
                    it was not practised but for certain causes expressed in the laws, and with
                    certain formalities usual in such cases. It was a sort of imitation of nature,
                    intended for the comfort of those who had no children: wherefore, he that was to
                    adopt was to have no children of his own, and to be past the age of getting any;
                    nor were eunuchs allowed to adopt, as being under an actual impotency of
                    begetting children: neither was it lawful for a young man to adopt an elder,
                    because that would have been contrary to the order of nature; nay, it was even
                    required that the person who adopted should he eighteen years older than his
                    adopted son, that there might at least appear a probability of his being the
                    natural father.</p>
                <p>Among the Greeks it was called <hi rend="italic">υιοrης, filiation.</hi> It was
                    allowed to such as had no issue of their own, excepting those who were not <hi
                    rend="italic">κύριοι εαυτών,</hi><hi rend="italic">their own masters, e. g.</hi>
                    slaves, women, madmen, infants, or persons under twenty years of age; who being
                    incapable of making wills, or managing their own estates, were not allowed to
                    adopt heirs to them. Foreigners being incapable of inheriting at Athens, if any
                    such were adopted, it was necessary first to make them free of the city. The
                    ceremony of adoption being over, the adopted had his name enrolled in the tribe
                    and ward of his new father; for which entry a peculiar time was allotted, viz.
                    the festival 3α^λ∕α. To prevent rash and inconsiderate adoptions, the
                    Lacedemonians had a law, that adoptions should be transacted, or at least
                    confirmed, in the presence of their kings. The children adopted were invested
                    with all the privileges, and obliged to perform all the duties, of natural
                    children; and being thus provided for in another family, ceased to have any
                    claim of inheritance or kindred in the family which they had left, unless they
                    first renounced their adoption, which by the laws of Solon they were not allowed
                    to do, unless they had first begotten children to bear the name of the person
                    who had adopted them; thus providing against the ruin of the families, which
                    would otherwise have been extinguished by the desertion of those who had been
                    adopted to preserve them. If the children adopted happened to die without
                    children, the inheritance could not be alienated from the family into which they
                    had been adopted, but returned to the relations of the adopter. It should seem
                    that, by the Athenian law, a person, after having adopted another, was not
                    allowed to marry without permission from the magistrate; and there are instances
                    of persons who, being ill used by their adoptive children, petitioned for such
                    leave. However this may be, it is certain that some men married after they had
                    adopted sons; in which case, if they begat legitimate children, their estates
                    were equally shared between the begotten and the adopted.</p>
                <p>The Romans had two forms of adoption; the one before the pretor, the other at an
                    assembly of the people, in the times of the commonwealth, and afterwards by a
                    rescript from the emperor. In the former, the natural father addressed himself
                    to the pretor, declaring that he emancipated his son, resigned all his authority
                    over him, and consented that he should be translated into the family of the
                    adopter. The latter was practised where the party to be adopted was already
                    free; and this was called <hi rend="italic">adrogation.</hi> The person adopted
                    changed all his names, assuming the prename, name, and surname, of the person
                    who adopted him.</p>
                <p>Besides the formalities prescribed by the Roman law, various other methods have
                    taken place, which have given denominations to different species of adoption
                    among the Gothic nations, in different ages. Thus, <hi rend="italic">ADOPTION by
                    Arms</hi> was when a prince made a present of arms to a person, in consideration
                    of his merit and valour. The obligation here laid on the adoptive son was to
                    protect and defend the father from injuries, affronts, &amp;c. And hence,
                    according to Selden, the ceremony of dubbing knights took its origin as well as
                    name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Adoption</hi><hi rend="italic">by Baptism</hi> is
                    that spiritual affinity which is contracted by godfathers and godchildren in the
                    ceremony of baptism. This kind of adoption was introduced into the Greek church,
                    and came afterwards into use among the ancient Franks, as appears by the
                    capitulars of Charlemagne.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Adoption</hi><hi rend="italic">by Hair</hi> was
                    performed by cutting off the hair of a person, and giving it to the adoptive
                    father. It was thus that Pope John VIII. adopted Boson, king of Arles, which
                    perhaps is the only instance in history of adoption in the order of the
                    ecclesiastics; a law that professes to imitate nature, not daring to give
                    children to those in whom it would be thought a crime to beget any.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ADOPTION by Matrimony</hi> is the taking of the children of a
                    wife or husband by a former marriage into the condition of proper or natural
                    children, and admitting them to inherit on the same footing with those of the
                    present marriage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ADoρτi0N by Testament,</hi> that performed by appointing a
                    person heir by will, on condition of his assuming the name, arms, &amp;c. of the
                    adopter; of which kind we meet with several instances in the Roman history.
                    Among the Turks, the ceremony of adoption is performed by obliging the person
                    adopted to pass through the shirt of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031902"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1902-0161"/>adopter. Hence, among that people, to adopt is
                    expressed by the phrase, <hi rend="italic">to draw another through my
                    shirt.</hi> It is said that something like this has also been observed among the
                    Hebrews, where the prophet Elijah adopted Elisha for his son and successor, and
                    communicated to him the gift of prophecy, by letting fall his cloak or mantle on
                    him. But adoption, properly so called, does not appear to have been practised
                    among the ancient Jews. Moses says nothing of it in his laws; and Jacob’s
                    adoption of his two grandsons, Ephraim and Manassch, is not so properly an
                    adoption as a kind of substitution, whereby those two sons of Joseph were
                    allotted an equal portion in Israel with his own sons.</p>
