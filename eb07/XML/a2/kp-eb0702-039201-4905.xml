                <p><label type="entry">ALCUINUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Flaccus</hi></label>, an
                    ecclesiastic of the eighth century. He was born, it is supposed, in Yorkshire.
                    He was educated, however, at York, under the direction of Archbishop Egbert, as
                    we learn from his own letters, in which he frequently calls that great prelate
                    his beloved master, and the clergy of York the companions of his youthful
                    studies. As he survived Venerable Bede about 70 years, it is hardly possible
                    that he could have received any part of his education under him, as some writers
                    of literary history have affirmed; and it is worthy of observation, that he
                    never calls that great man his master, though he speaks of him with the highest
                    veneration. It is not well known to what preferments he had attained in the
                    church before he left England, though some say he was abbot of Canterbury. The
                    occasion of his leaving his native country was his being sent on an embassy by
                    Offa, king of Mercia, to the emperor Charlemagne, who contracted so great an
                    esteem and friendship for him, that he earnestly solicited, and at length
                    prevailed upon him, to settle in his court, and become his preceptor in the
                    sciences. Alcuinus accordingly instructed that great prince in rhetoric, logic,
                    mathematics, and divinity, which rendered him one of his greatest favourites.
                    “He was treated with so much kindness and familiarity,” says a contemporary
                    writer, “by the emperor, that the other courtiers called him, by way of
                    eminence, the <hi rend="italic">emperors delight?</hi> Charlemagne employed his
                    learned favourite to write several books against the heretical opinions of
                    Felix, bishop of Urgel, in Catalonia, and to defend the orthodox faith against
                    that heresiarch, in the council of Frankfort, A. <hi rend="smallcaps">d.</hi>
                    794; which he performed to the entire satisfaction of the emperor and council,
                    and even to the conviction of Felix and his followers, who abandoned their
                    errors. The emperor consulted chiefly with Alcuinus on all things relating to
                    religion and learning, and by his advice did many great things for the
                    advancement of both. An academy was established in the imperial palace, over
                    which Alcuinus presided, and in which the princes and prime nobility were
                    educated; and other academies were established in the chief towns of Italy and
                    France, at his instigation, and . under his inspection. “France,” says one of
                    our best writers of literary history, “is indebted to Alcuinus for all the
                    polite learning it boasted of in that and the following ages. The universities
                    of Paris, Tours, Fulden, Soissons, and many others, owe to him their origin and
                    increase, those of whom he was not the superior and founder being at least
                    enlightened by his doctrine and example, and enriched by the benefits he
                    procured for them from Charlemagne.” After Alcuinus had spent many years in the
                    most intimate familiarity with the greatest prince of his age, he at length,
                    with great difficulty, obtained leave to retire from court to his abbey of St
                    Martin, at Tours. Here he kept up a constant correspondence by letters with
                    Charlemagne, from which it appears that both the emperor and his learned friend
                    were animated with the most ardent love to learning and religion, and constantly
                    employed in contriving and executing the noblest designs for their advancement.
                    He composed many treatises on a great variety of subjects, in a style much
                    superior in purity and elegance to that of the generality of writers in the age
                    in which he flourished. Charlemagne often solicited him, with all the warmth of
                    a most affectionate friend, to return to court, and favour him with his company
                    and advice; but he still excused himself, and nothing could draw him from his
                    retirement in his abbey of St Martin in Tours, where he died <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> S04. His works were collected and published by
                    Andrew du Chesne, in one volume folio, Paris, 1617. They consist of, 1. Tracts
                    upon Scripture; 2. Tracts upon doctrine, discipline, and morality; 3. Historical
                    treatises, letters, and poems. Since that edition there has been published an
                    incredible number of tracts, poems, &amp;c. ascribed to this author, most of
                    which, in all probability, were not his.</p>
