                <p><label type="entry">ALE</label>, a fermented liquor obtained from an infusion of
                    malt, and differing from beer chiefly in having a less proportion of hops. This
                    liquor, the natural substitute of wine in such countries as could not produce
                    the grape, is said to have originally been made in Egypt, the first planted
                    kingdom, on the dispersion from the East, that was supposed unable to produce
                    grapes. And, as the Noachian colonies pierced further into the west, they found,
                    or thought they found, the same defect, and supplied it in the same manner. Thus
                    the natives of Spain, the inhabitants of France, and the aborigines of Britain,
                    all used an infusion of barley for their ordinary liquor; and it was called by
                    the various names of <hi rend="italic">Caelia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ceria</hi> in the first country, <hi rend="italic">Cerevisia</hi> in the
                    second, and <hi rend="italic">Cur-mi</hi> in the last; all literally importing
                    only <hi rend="italic">the strong water.</hi></p>
                <p>“All the several nations,” says Pliny, “who inhabit the west of Europe, have a
                    liquor with which they intoxicate themselves, made of corn and water. The manner
                    of making this liquor is sometimes different in Gaul, Spain, and other
                    countries, and is called by many various names; but its nature and properties
                    are everywhere the same. The people of Spain, in particular, brew the liquor so
                    well that it will keep good a long time. So exquisite is the cunning of mankind
                    in gratifying their vicious appetites, that they have thus invented a method to
                    make water itself intoxicate.” The method in which the ancient Britons and other
                    Celtic nations, made their ale is thus described by Isidorus and Orosius: “The
                    grain is steeped in water and made to germinate, by which its spirits are
                    excited and set at liberty; it is then dried and grinded; after which it is
                    infused in a certain quantity of water; which, being fermented, becomes a
                    pleasant, warming, strengthening, and intoxicating liquor.” This ale was most
                    commonly made of barley, but sometimes of wheat, oats, and millet.</p>
                <p>Anciently the Welsh and Scots had also two kinds of ale, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >common ale</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spiced ale</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and their value was thus ascertained by law: “If a farmer hath no mead, he shall
                    pay two casks of spiced ale, or four casks of common ale, for one cask of mead.”
                    By this law, a cask of spiced ale, nine palms in height and eighteen palms in
                    diameter, was valued at a sum of money equal in efficacy to L.7. 10s. of our
                    present money; and a cask of common ale of the same dimensions at a sum equal to
                    L.3. 15s. This is a sufficient proof that even common ale at that period was an
                    article of luxury among the Welsh, which could only be obtained by the great and
                    opulent. Wine seems to have been quite unknown even to the kings of Wales at
                    that period, as it is not so much as once mentioned in their laws; though
                    Giraldus Cambrensis, who flourished about a century after the Conquest,
                    acquaints us that there was a vineyard in his time at Maenarper, near Pembroke,
                    in South Wales.</p>
                <p>Ale was the favourite liquor of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, as it had been of
                    their ancestors the ancient Germans. Before their conversion to Christianity,
                    they believed that drinking large and frequent draughts of ale was one of the
                    chief felicities which those heroes enjoyed who were admitted into the hall of
                    Odin. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Brewing,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
