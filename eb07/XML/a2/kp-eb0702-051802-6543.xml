                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    historical painter of considerable celebrity, was born at Alloa, on the 13th
                    February 1744. At a very early age he showed such marks of genius as attracted
                    the notice of some gentlemen living in the neighbourhood. In a remote part of
                    the country, and deprived of the ordinary means of indulging his propensity to
                    drawing, he betook himself, when a boy, to such implements and materials as he
                    could readily procure; and the mechanical skill and taste which, in particular,
                    he displayed in using his knife, have been mentioned as remarkable for his
                    years. Mr Stewart, then collector of the Customs at Alloa, having mentioned
                    these proofs of natural talent to Mr Foulis the printer, who some time before
                    had instituted an academy in Glasgow for painting and engraving, he invited
                    young Allan to study under his care. Here he remained about seven years,
                    studying the elementary principles of his art; and, by the proficiency which he
                    attained, justified the opinion of his talents which had procured him admission
                    to that ill-fated seminary. But although the public taste for the fine arts,
                    which then existed in Scotland, was so feeble as to leave his preceptor without
                    support, which his liberal and spirited efforts justly claimed, Allan, on
                    leaving the academy, had the good fortune to gain the patronage of individuals
                    whose generosity enabled him to prosecute his views, and to improve his taste,
                    by studying the works of art abroad. At the joint expense of several persons of
                    fortune, particularly Lord Catheart and Mr Abererombie of Tullibody, he was
                    enabled to go to Italy; and at Rome he devoted himself with great zeal to his
                    profession. Here he remained for no less a period than sixteen years, during
                    which time his subsistence chiefly depended on the copies which he made from the
                    most celebrated pictures of the ancient masters. Among the original works which
                    he then painted, there was one which does the highest credit to his talents, and
                    which gained for him the gold medal given by the Academy of St Luke, in the year
                    1773, for the best specimen of historical composition. This picture represents
                    the <hi rend="italic">Origin of Painting,</hi> and is well known by the
                    excellent engraving of it by Cunego. His design of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calabrian Shepherds</hi> is also a composition of great merit; and his four
                    views of the Carnivals at Rome, etched by Paul Sandby, are said likewise to have
                    been very successful.</p>
                <p>On his return to his native country, he took up his residence in Edinburgh, and
                    soon after, on the death of Alexander Runciman, in 1786, was appointed director
                    and master of the academy established by the Board of Trustees for Manufactures
                    in Scotland. There he executed a great variety of works, of various degrees of
                    merit; but perhaps none such as might have been expected from the author of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Origin of Painting.</hi> Those, indeed, by which he is most
                    known, are of a east altogether different, being remarkable for the comic humour
                    which they display. The <hi rend="italic">Scotch Wedding,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Highland Dance,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Repentance Stool,</hi>
                    with his <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of the Gentle Shepherd,</hi> are all of
                    this class, and so generally known, from his own spirited etchings in
                    aqua-tinta, as to need no description. Of his graver compositions, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Prodigal Son,</hi> in possession of Lord Catheart, and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Hercules and</hi><hi rend="italic">Omphale,</hi> in the possession
                    of Mr Erskine of Mar, are regarded as works of great merit.</p>
                <p>As an artist, Mr Allan possessed much facility of invention, with a keen
                    discernment of those evanescent circumstances in the outward form which mark the
                    different shades of passion and affection in the mind. With the talent of
                    artfully arranging the various parts of a crowded and bustling scene, such as
                    appears in some of his comic productions, he possessed that feeling for
                    simplicity which gives to his graver compositions a classical and antique air of
                    elegance. In his drawing he was often hasty and incorrect. He executed a great
                    variety of etchings and drawings in water colours, which are valuable, on
                    account of their excellent humour, and the great knowledge of national character
                    which they express. We do not know that Allan left any pupil who has followed
                    his particular line in painting; but among those who received from him the
                    rudiments of art while he continued master of the academy, we may name the late
                    Mr Hugh W. Williams, whose genius, however, directed him to a different course,
                    which conducted him to high and merited distinction as a landscape painter.</p>
                <p>Mr Allan is remembered and spoken of as an excellent private character. He died
                    at Edinburgh on the 6th of August 1796, in the 53d year of his age.</p>
