            <div facs="nls:193029822?mode=fullsize" type="entry">
                <p><label type="entry">A</label>. The first letter of the alphabet in every known
                    language, the Ethiopie or Abyssinian alone excepted, in which it is the
                    thirteenth. Of the sixteen elementary sounds of the human voice, that which is
                    represented by this initial letter is the simplest, and requires the least
                    exertion of the organs to produce it; for its enunciation is effected by merely
                    opening the mouth, and breathing, so that the air propelled through the glottis
                    may resound audibly in the cavity of the mouth and nostrils. Hence this sound is
                    remarkable for its universality as well as simplicity. Many of the lower animals
                    possess the capacity of uttering it, as every one must be sensible who has
                    attended to their distinguishing cries, in all, or at least in many of which, it
                    may be easily recognised. It is also the basis, so to speak, of vocality; for,
                    on attentive examination, it will be found that the other vowels are little more
                    than labial, lingual, dental, or palatal modifications of this primary,
                    universal, and most elementary sound. It is not without reason therefore that
                    the symbol of this sound is (with one solitary exception) placed at the
                    commencement of every known alphabet. Cicero seems to have disliked the sound of
                    this letter; for in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Oratore,</hi> c. xlix. he denominates it <hi rend="italic">insuavissima
                    littera,</hi> probably on account of the out-breathing or expiration necessary
                    to produce the sound of it; but, upon the same principle, the other vowels ought
                    also to have shared his displeasure, seeing that they are merely modifications
                    of this primary <hi rend="italic">στοrχειον</hi> or element.</p>
                <p>In the English language, A is the mark or symbol of three different sounds,
                    termed by grammarians the <hi rend="italic">broad,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >open,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">slender;</hi> epithets, the two former of
                    which have an immediate reference to organic modification, as well as to the
                    impulse or volume of voice; while the latter seems to apply to the degree of
                    intonation alone. Of these varieties of sound, the first, which resembles that
                    of the German A, occurs in such monosyllables as <hi rend="italic">hall, wall,
                    pall, thrall,</hi> where the <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is pronounced in the same
                    manner as <hi rend="italic">au</hi> in <hi rend="italic">cause;</hi> that is,
                    broad and long. The Saxons, it is probable, expressed only this sound of the
                    letter, which is still commonly retained in the north of England, and prevails
                    universally throughout Scotland, the only parts of the island where the genius
                    and idiom of the Saxon language have withstood modern innovations. The open
                    sound of A, again, resembles that of the Italian in <hi rend="italic"
                    >adagio</hi> and such like words, and is nearly the same with that of <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> in <hi rend="italic">father, rather,</hi> &amp;c. But the
                    slender sound, which is peculiar to the English language alone, is identical
                    with the sound of the French diphthong <hi rend="italic">ai</hi> in such words
                    as <hi rend="italic">mais, paix, gai,</hi> and is exemplified in <hi
                    rend="italic">hate, late, waste, paste, place, race</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    as also in polysyllables, such as <hi rend="italic">toleration,
                    justification,</hi> with many others which it is unnecessary to specify. So much
                    for the varieties of this initial sound in English words. A, however, is
                    sometimes employed as an affix in burlesque poetry; in which case it has no
                    other effect than to add a syllable to the line, without any alteration of the
                    sense, just as the vowel or interjection 0 very often does in our old ballads,
                    and in some modern imitations of them. It is also thought to be redundant and
                    insignificative in such words as <hi rend="italic">arise, awake, aright, adoing,
                    agoing.</hi> But this seems a mistake; for the ά here used as a prefix, is
                    probably the French abbreviation of the Latin preposition <hi rend="italic"
                    >ad;</hi> and hence it appears to have an intensive effect, adding to and
                    strengthening the import of the word with which it is combined. In the line,
                    “<hi rend="italic">Arise, awake,</hi> or be for ever falľn,” it is evident that
                    the words “arise, awake,” convey a meaning stronger in degree than the simple
                    words <hi rend="italic">rise, wake</hi> would have done. The pre-positionary
                    effect in such words as <hi rend="italic">a-doing, a-going,</hi> is indeed
                    admitted by grammarians; but, if this be the case, where is the distinction
                    between these instances and <hi rend="italic">a-rise, a-wake,</hi> where the
                    prefix is said to be redundant, except that, by usage, it has coalesced in some
                    measure with the word to which it is prefixed? In such compounds as <hi
                    rend="italic">a-foot, asleep, a-week, a-head, a-man,</hi> as well as when used
                    before, local surnames, as <hi rend="italic">Cornelius</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                    Lapide,</hi><hi rend="italic">Thomas a Kempis, Thomas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi><hi rend="italic">Becket,</hi> nobody has ever doubted that the <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is a preposition. When <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is used as
                    an article, it is merely an abbreviation of the old primary numeral <hi
                    rend="italic">ane,</hi> one, and consequently it has no plural signification.
                    Thus <hi rend="italic">a</hi> house, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> field, <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> ship, mean <hi rend="italic">one</hi> house, <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> field, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> ship; but as it is not
                    one of two, ten, or twenty houses, fields, or ships, but of <hi rend="italic"
                    >any</hi> number, however great or small, hence it becomes in effect quite
                    general and indefinite, or, in other words, the opposite of <hi rend="italic"
                    >the,</hi> which defines and limits the attention to something spoken of,
                    pointed out, or referred to.</p>
                <p>Among the ancients, A was a numeral letter, and stood for 500, and when a dash
                    was placed on the top, thus, Ā, for ten times that number, or 5000. In the
                    Julian calendar<pb break="no" facs="nls:193029835?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-9835-0002"/> it is the first of the seven Dominical Letters.
                    Long before the establishment of Christianity, it had been in use among the
                    Romans as one of the eight <hi rend="italic">Litterae Nundinales</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and it was in imitation of this usage that the Dominical
                    Letters were first introduced. Among logicians, the letter A is employed as a
                    symbol or sign to denote an universal affirmative, in contradistinction to an
                    universal negative proposition, in conformity with the following, which is the
                    first verse of a well-known distich:</p>
                <l part="N"> Asserit <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> negat <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> sed
                    universaliter ambae. </l>
                <p>Thus, the first mode of the first figure, which is a syllogism consisting of
                    three universal affirmative propositions, is said to be a syllogism in Barbara,
                    a word in which the <hi rend="italic">alphas</hi> alone are significant, the
                    repetition of that letter thrice denoting so many of the propositions to be
                    affirmative and universal, conformably to the technical classification—</p>
                <l part="N"> Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio, dato primae. </l>
                <p>In the public assemblies or <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> of the Romans the
                    letter A was used in giving votes or suffrages. When a new law was proposed,
                    each voter received a couple of wooden tallies or ballots, one of them marked
                    vzith a capital A, signifying <hi rend="italic">Antiquo,</hi> q. d. <hi
                    rend="italic">antiquam volo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the other with U.
                    R., the initials <hi rend="italic">of Uti Pogas.</hi> Those who were against the
                    proposed law, (or <hi rend="italic">rogatio,</hi> as it was called) threw the
                    former of these into the urn; meaning thereby <hi rend="italic">I</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">antiquate</hi><hi rend="italic">it,</hi> I prefer the ancient law,
                    and desire no innovations; while such as were favourable to the bill, as we
                    would call it, threw in the latter, signifying, <hi rend="italic">Be it as you
                    desire,</hi> or I vote for the measure you propose. A was also marked on tallies
                    or tablets used in voting in criminal trials, and, standing for <hi
                    rend="italic">Absolvo,</hi> denoted acquittal; whence Cicero, in his speech for
                    Milo, denominates it <hi rend="italic">littera salutaris,</hi> or the letter of
                    acquittal. We may add, in explanation, that, on criminal trials, three of these
                    tallies or tablets were distributed to each of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >judices,</hi> or persons constituting the assize, by whom the accused was to be
                    tried; one of them marked with the letter A, <hi rend="italic">absolvo,</hi> I
                    acquit; another with the letter C, <hi rend="italic">(littera tristis)
                    condemno,</hi> I condemn; and a third with the letters N. L. <hi rend="italic"
                    >non liquet,</hi> it is not clear. From the number of ballots cast into the urn,
                    those marked with N. L. were deducted, and the <hi rend="italic">praetor</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">magistratus</hi> pronounced sentence of acquittal or
                    condemnation, according as the A’s or the C’s were the more numerous. In cases
                    of equality the prisoner was absolved.</p>
                <p>In ancient inscriptions, whether on marble, brass, or stone, A stands for <hi
                    rend="italic">Augustus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Augustalis, ager, agit, aiunt,
                    aliquando, antique, assolet, aut;</hi> A A for <hi rend="italic">Augusti,
                    Augusta, Aulus Agerius, aes alienum, ante audita, apud agrum, aurum
                    argentum</hi>; A A A for <hi rend="italic">Augusti</hi> when they are three in
                    number, and <hi rend="italic">aurum,</hi><hi rend="italic">argentum, oes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and sometimes its meaning can only be determined by the
                    context of the inscription. Isidore adds, that when this letter occurs after the
                    word <hi rend="italic">miles,</hi> a soldier, it denotes him young <hi
                    rend="italic">(miles</hi><hi rend="italic">adolescens).</hi> On the reverse of
                    ancient medals, it indicates the place where they were struck, as Argos or
                    Athens; but on coins of a modern date, it is the mark of the city of Paris,
                    probably taken anagramwise from the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> letter of the
                    word <hi rend="italic">Lutetia.</hi></p>
                <p>A, as an abbreviation, is likewise of frequent occurrence in the works of modern
                    authors; as A. D. for <hi rend="italic">anno Domini,</hi> A. Μ. for <hi
                    rend="italic">artium</hi><hi rend="italic">magister, anno</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mundi,</hi><hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> The letter α with a line above it
                    thus, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> is used in medical prescriptions for <hi
                    rend="italic">ana,</hi> of each; and sometimes it is written thus, <hi
                    rend="italic">a a</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for example, <hi rend="italic"
                    >nιel. sacchar,</hi><hi rend="italic">et mann,</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vel</hi><hi rend="italic">āa ξj</hi>; that is, take honey, sugar,
                    and manna, of each one ounce. Put to bills of exchange, A is, in England, an
                    abbreviation of <hi rend="italic">accepted,</hi> and in France of <hi
                    rend="italic">accepte.</hi> It is likewise usual with merchants to mark their
                    sets of books with the letters A, B, C, &amp;c. instead of the ordinary
                    numerals, 1, 2,3, &amp;c. A A A is the chemical abbreviation for <hi
                    rend="italic">amalgama</hi> or <hi rend="italic">amalgamation.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
