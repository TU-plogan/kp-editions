                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ALDRICH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label>, bishop of
                    Carlisle, was born at Burnham, in Buckinghamshire, about the year 1493, and
                    educated at Eaton school, from whence, in 1507, he was elected scholar of King’s
                    Collège, Cambridge, where he took his degree in arts, and was afterwards proctor
                    of the university. In 1525 he was appointed master of Eaton school, then became
                    fellow of that college, and finally provost. In 1529 he went to Oxford, where,
                    being first incorporated bachelor of divinity, in the following year he
                    proceeded doctor in that faculty. In 1531 he-was made archdeacon of Colchester,
                    in 1534 canon of Windsor, and the same year registrary of the order of the
                    Garter. He was consecrated bishop of Carlisle in the year 1537, and died at
                    Horncastle in Lincolnshire in 1556. He wrote, 1. Epistola ad Gul. Hormanum, in
                    Latin verse, printed in Horman’s <hi rend="italic">Antibossico,</hi> Lond. 1521,
                    of which book Pitts erroneously makes Aldrich the author; 2. Epigrammata varia;
                    3. Latin verses, and another epistle to Horman, prefixed to the <hi

                    sacrament.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Aldrich, Dr Henry,</hi> an eminent English divine and
                    philosopher, born at London in 1647, was educated at Westminster school under
                    the famous Dr Busby, and admitted of Christ-church College, Oxford. He had a
                    great share in the controversy with the Papists in the reign of James II.; and
                    Bishop Burnet ranks him among those who examined all the points of Popery with a
                    solidity of judgment, clearness of argument, depth of learning, and vivacity of
                    writing, far beyond any who had before that time written in our language. He
                    rendered himself so conspicuous, that at the Revolution, when Massey the Popish
                    dean of Christ-church fled, his deanery was conferred on him. In this station he
                    behaved in an exemplary manner, and. that fabric owes much of its beauty to his
                    ingenuity<pb break="no" facs="nls:193034944" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4944-0395"/>: it
                    was Aldrich who designed the beautiful square called Peckwater Quadrangle, which
                    is esteemed an excellent piece of architecture. In imitation of his predecessor
                    Dr Fell, he published yearly a piece of some ancient Greek author, as a present
                    to the students of his house. He published a System of Logic, with some other
                    pieces; and the revising of Clarendon’s History of the Rebellion was intrusted
                    to him and Bishop Sprat. Besides his preferments above mentioned, Dr Aldrich was
                    also rector of Wem, in Shropshire. He was chosen prolocutor of the convocation
                    in 1702. This worthy person died at Christ-church on the 14th of December 1710.
                    As to his character, he was a most universal scholar, and had a taste for all
                    sorts of learning, especially architecture. Sir John Hawkins has favoured the
                    public with several particulars relative to Dr Aldrich’s skill in music; and on
                    account of the Doctor’s eminence in this respect, Sir John ha§ given his life,
                    with his head prefixed. His abilities as a musician rank him,· we are told,
                    among the greatest masters of the science. He composed many services for the
                    church, which are well known; as are also his anthems, nearly to the number of
                    20. He adapted, with great skill and judgment, English words to many of the
                    notes of Palestrina, Carissimi, Victoria, and other Italian composers for the
                    church, some of which are frequently sung in our cathedrals as anthems. By the
                    happy talent which Dr Aldrich possessed, of naturalizing the compositions of the
                    old Italian masters, and accommodating them to an English ear, he increased the
                    stores of our own church. Though the Doctor chiefly applied himself to the
                    cultivation of sacred music, yet being a man of humour, he could divert himself
                    by producing pieces of a lighter kind. There are two catches of his, the one,
                    Hark the bonny Christ-church Bells; the other, entitled A Smoking Catch, to be
                    sung by four men smoking their pipes, which is not more difficult to sing than
                    diverting to hear. His love of smoking was, it seems, so excessive, as to be an
                    entertaining topic of discourse in the university. Such was Dr Aldrielfs regard
                    for the advancement of music, and the honour of its professors, that he had
                    formed a design of writing a history of the science; and the materials from
                    which he proposed to compile it are yet extant in the library of his own
                    college. It appears from these materials that he had marked down every thing
                    which he had met with concerning music and musicians, but that he had brought no
                    part of them into any kind of form.</p>
                <p>Dr Aldrich is of some note as a Latin poet. In the <hi rend="italic">Jtlus&lt;ε
                    Anglicanae</hi> we find two elegant copies of verses by him; one on the
                    accession of King William III., and the other on the death of the duke of
                    Gloucester. Sir John Hawkins has preserved a humorous translation by him of the
                    well-known English ballad,</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> A soldier and a sailor, </l>
                    <l part="N"> A tinker and a tailor, &amp;c. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>The following epigram, entitled “Causae Bibendi,” is likewise ascribed to Dr
                    Aldrich :—</p>
                <p><l part="N"><hi rend="italic">Si bene quid memini, Causae sunt quinque
                    bibendi;</hi></l><l part="N"><hi rend="italic">Hospitis Adventus, proesens
                    Sitis, atque futura,</hi></l><l part="N"><hi rend="italic">Aut Vini Bonitas, aut
                    quoelibet altera Causa.</hi></l></p>
                <p>The epigram has been thus translated :—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> If on my theme I rightly think, </l>
                    <l part="N"> There are five reasons why men drink; </l>
                    <l part="N"> Good wine, a friend, because I’m dry, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Or lest I should be by and by, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Or any other reason why. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>The translation is not equal to the original. It is evident, from the verses
                    cited and referred to, that Dr Aldrich was of a very cheerful and pleasant turn
                    of mind.</p>
                <p>Indeed he is always spoken of as having been a man of wit, and as one who to his
                    great talents and virtues joined those amiable qualities which rendered him the
                    object of general affection, as well as of general esteem and respect. Having
                    never been married, he appropriated his income to works of hospitality and
                    beneficence, and encouraging learning to the utmost of his power, of which he
                    was a most magnificent patron, as well as one of the greatest men in England, if
                    considered as a Christian or a gentleman. He had always the interest of his
                    college at heart, whereof he was an excellent governor. His modesty and humility
                    prevented him from prefixing his name to the learned tracts which he published
                    during his life. At his death he wished to be buried in the cathedral, without
                    any memorial; which his thrifty nephew complied with, depositing him on the
                    south side of Bishop Fell’s grave, December 22, eight days after his decease,
                    which happened in the 63d or 64th year of his age.</p>
