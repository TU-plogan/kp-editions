                <p><label type="entry">ALMAGRO</label>, a fortress of Spain, the capital of one of
                    the districts of La Mancha. It was built by the archbishop Roderic of Toledo,
                    who finished it in 1214, and put a considerable garrison into it to restrain the
                    incursions of the Moors. This was hardly done when the fortress was besieged by
                    an army of 5000 horse and foot, under the command of a Moorish officer of great
                    reputation; but the prelate, its founder, took care to supply those within with
                    such plenty of necessaries, that at length the enemy found themselves obliged to
                    raise the siege and retire with great loss.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Almagro,</hi><hi rend="italic">Diego de,</hi> a Spanish
                    commander, was of such obscure birth and mean parentage, that he derived his
                    name from the village where he was born in ¼63. Deprived of the means of early
                    instruction, he could neither read nor write; but nevertheless, in consequence
                    of his improvements in the military art, he formed an association with Francisco
                    Pizarro and Hernando de Luque, for the purpose of discoveries and conquest upon
                    the Peruvian coast. The governor of Panama having sanctioned their enterprise,
                    they devoted their united exertions to that undertaking. Pizarro directed the
                    conquest, and Almaġro was appointed to conduct the supplies of provisions and
                    reinforcements. In the first two unsuccessful attempts, he performed this office
                    with persevering fidelity and uncommon activity. His perseverance was followed
                    with complete success; for they at last discovered the coast of Peru, and landed
                    at Ťumbez, situated about three degrees south of the line, and distinguished by
                    its temple, and a palace of the incas or sovereigns. Pizzaro was sent over to
                    Spain to solicit further powers, after the three adventurers had previously
                    adjusted their future preferments, and agreed that Pizarro should be governor,
                    Almagro lieutenant-governor, and Luque bishop. In this negotiation Pizarro
                    obtained the clerical dignity for Luque; but, chiefly concerned about his own
                    interest, he neglected the preferment of Almagro. On his return, Almagro was so
                    enraged, that he refused to act with such a perfidious companion, and resolved
                    to form a new association. Pizarro for the present artfully endeavoured to avert
                    the indignation of Almagro, and gradually soothed the rage and disappointment of
                    the soldier. The union was renewed upon the former terms; and it was solemnly
                    stipulated that a common expense and a common advantage should take place.</p>
                <p>In February 1531, leaving Almagro at Panama to supply provisions and
                    reinforcements, Pizarro set sail for. Peru. He attacked a principal settlement
                    of the natives in the province of Coaque, obtained immense spoil, and made such
                    ample remittances to Almagro as enabled him to complete his reinforcement; and
                    in the close of the year 1532 Almagro arrived at St Michael with a body of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193036699" xml:id="kp-eb0702-6699-0530"/> men nearly double
                    the number of those whom Pizarro had along with him. The Spaniards about this
                    time took captive the unfortunate Inca Atahualpa; and after they had received an
                    immense sum for his ransom, they barbarously put him to death. Ferdinand Pizarro
                    sailed for Spain with the news of their success, and with remittances to a great
                    amount; and consequently Almagro gained that elevated station he had so long and
                    so eagerly desired. But no sooner did he receive the intelligence of his
                    promotion by the royal grant, than he attempted to seize Cuzco, the imperial
                    residence of the incas, under pretence that it lay within his destined
                    territory. This produced a new quarrel; but peace was restored upon condition
                    that Almagro should attempt the conquest of Chili, and, if he did not find in
                    that province an establishment adequate to his merit, that Pizarro should yield
                    up to him a part of Peru.</p>
                <p>In 1535 he accordingly set out at the head of 570 Europeans, and in crossing the
                    mountains he suffered great hardships and losses by mistaking the route; but at
                    length he descended into the plains of that devoted region. Here he met with a
                    more vigorous resistance from the natives than the Spaniards had ever
                    experienced in other countries. He had, however, made some progress, when he was
                    recalled to Peru by the news of the natives having risen in great numbers, and
                    attacked Lima and Cuzco. He pursued a new route, and marching through the sandy
                    plains on the coast, he suffered by heat and drought calamities not inferior to
                    those which he had endured from cold and famine on the summits of the Andes.
                    Arriving at a favourable moment, he resolved to hold the place both against the
                    Indians and his Spanish rivals. He attacked the Peruvian army with great vigour,
                    and making a great slaughter, he proceeded to the gates of Cuzco without any
                    further interruption. The open, affable, and generous temper of Almagro gained
                    over to his side many of the adherents of the Pizarros, who were disgusted with
                    their harsh and oppressive conduct. With the aid of these he advanced towards
                    the city by night, surprised the sentinels, and surrounded the house where the
                    two brothers Ferdinand and Gonzalo Pizarro resided, who were compelled, after an
                    obstinate defence, to surrender at discretion. A form of government was settled
                    in the name of Almagro, and his jurisdiction over Cuzco was universally
                    acknowledged. This was the origin of a civil war, the beginning of which was
                    very advantageous to Almagro, who by skilful manoeuvres entirely routed a body
                    of Spanish troops advancing to the relief of Cuzco, and made Alvarado, their
                    commander, prisoner. But instead of improving these advantages, he unwisely
                    marched back to Cuzco, and there awaited the arrival of Pizarro, who, convinced
                    of his own feeble resources, proposed an accommodation, and with his usual art
                    protracted the negotiation until he found himself in a condition to meet his
                    antagonist in the field of battle. Meanwhile Alvarado and one of the Pizarros,
                    by bribing their keepers, found means to escape, and persuaded 60 of the men who
                    guarded them to attend them in their flight; and the governor released the
                    other. When Pizarro thought himself sufficiently prepared to settle the dominion
                    of Peru, he marched with an army of 500 men to Cuzco. Almagro, previously to
                    this, worn out with age and infirmity, resigned the command to Orgognez. A
                    fierce and bloody battle ensued, in which Almagro’s army was defeated, and the
                    commander wounded. About 140 soldiers fell in the field, and Orgognez, along
                    with several officers of distinction, was massacred in cold blood. During that
                    fatal day, Almagro, placed in a litter, which was stationed on an eminence,
                    beheld from thence the total discomfiture of his troops, and felt all the
                    indignation of a soldier who had seldom expe rienced defeat. He was taken
                    prisoner, remained several months in confinement, and was afterwards tried and
                    condemned to death. In the view of an ignominious death, the courage of the
                    veteran forsook him, and he unsuccessfully supplicated for life in a manner
                    unworthy of his former character. All the arguments he could employ were
                    ineffectual. The Pizarros remained unmoved by all his entreaties. As soon,
                    however, as Almagro saw that his fate was inevitable, he resumed his courage,
                    and exhibited all his usual dignity and fortitude. In the year 1538, and in the
                    75th year of his age, he was strangled in prison, and afterwards beheaded. He
                    left one son by an Indian woman of Panama; and, in consequence of a power which
                    the emperor had granted him, he declared his son his successor in the
                    government, although he was then a prisoner in Lima.</p>
                <p>With the qualities of intrepid valour, indefatigable activity, and insurmountable
                    constancy, he blended the more amiable dispositions of frankness, generosity,
                    and candour. These qualities rendered him beloved by his followers, and his
                    misfortunes excited their sympathy and pity; so that his death was universally
                    regretted, and particularly by the poor Indians, who deemed him their guardian
                    and protector against the cruel and unfeeling Pizarro. Upon the whole review of
                    his character, it appears just to conclude, that he was, although of inferior
                    abilities, a more amiable man than his rival.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Almagro,</hi> the Younger, by his courage, generosity, and
                    other accomplishments, was placed at the head of the party after the death of
                    his father. The father, conscious of his own inferiority from the total want of
                    education, used every possible means to improve the mind and embellish the
                    manners of his son; so that he soon acquired those accomplishments which
                    rendered him respected by illiterate adventurers, who cheerfully ranged round
                    his standard, and by his dexterity and skill sought deliverance from the
                    oppressions of Pizarro. Juan de Herrada, an officer of great abilities,
                    continued still to direct his councils, and to regulate his enterprises; and,
                    while Pizarro confided in his own security, a conspiracy wa&lt;s formed against
                    him, which terminated in his death. The assassins, exulting in their success,
                    and waving their bloody swords, hastened to the street, proclaimed the death of
                    the tyrant, and compelled the magistrates and principal citizens of Lima to
                    acknowledge Almagro as lawful successor of his father. But his reign was of
                    short duration; for, in 1541, Vaca de Castro, arriving at Quito, produced the
                    royal commission, appointing him governor of Peru, together with all the
                    privileges and authority of Pizarro. The talents and influence of the new
                    governor soon overpowered the interest of Almagro, who, perceiving the rapid
                    decline of his influence, hastened with his troops to Cuzco, where his opponents
                    had erected the royal standard under the command of Pedro Alvarcz Holguin.
                    Herrada, the guide of his counsels, died during his march; and from that time
                    his measures were conspicuous for their violence, concerted with little
                    ingenuity, and executed with little address. At length, on September 16, 1542,
                    the forces of Almagro and Vaca de Castro met, and victory long remained
                    doubtful, till at last it declared for the new governor. Almagro conducted the
                    military operations of that fatal day with a gallant spirit, worthy of a better
                    cause, and deserving of a better fate; and his followers displayed uncommon
                    valour. In proportion to the number of combatants the carnage was very great. Of
                    Ið'ļ men, 500 fell in the field, and many more were wounded. Almagro escaped,
                    but being betrayed by some of ms own officers, he was publicly beheaded at
                    Cuzco, and in him the name and spirit of the party of Almagro became
                    extinct.</p>
