                <p><label type="entry">ADAM</label>, the first of the human race, was formed by the
                    Almighty on the sixth day of the creation. His body was made of the dust of the
                    earth; after which, God animated or gave it life, and Adam then became a
                    rational creature. His heavenly Parent did not leave his offspring in a
                    destitute state to shift for himself, but planted a garden, in which he caused
                    to grow not only every tree that was proper for producing food, but likewise
                    such as were agreeable to the eye, or merely ornamental. In this garden were
                    assembled all the brute creation, and, by their Maker, caused to pass before
                    Adam, who gave all of them names, which were judged proper by the Deity
                    himself.</p>
                <p>In this review Adam found none for a companion to himself. This solitary state
                    was seen by the Deity to be attended with some degree of unhappiness, and
                    therefore he threw Adam into a deep sleep, in which condition he took a rib from
                    his side, and, healing up the wound, formed a woman of the rib he had taken out.
                    On Adam’s awaking, the woman was brought to him; and he immediately knew her to
                    be one of his own species, calling her his bone and his flesh, and giving her
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">woman,</hi> because she was taken out of man.</p>
                <p>The first pair being thus created, God gave them authority over the inferior
                    creation, commanding them to subdue the earth, also to increase and multiply,
                    and fill it They were informed of the proper food for the beasts and for them;
                    the grass or green herbs being appointed for beasts, and fruits or seeds for
                    man. Their proper employment also was assigned them; namely, <hi rend="italic"
                    >to dress the garden and to keep it.</hi></p>
                <p>Though Adam was thus highly favoured and instructed by his Maker, there was a
                    single tree, which grew in the middle of the garden, of the fruit of which they
                    were not allowed to eat; being told that they should surely die in the day they
                    ate of it. This tree was named the <hi rend="italic">Tree of the Knowledge of
                    Good and Evil.</hi> This prohibition, however, they soon broke through. The
                    woman having entered into conversation with <hi rend="italic">the Serpent,</hi>
                    was by him persuaded, that by eating of the tree she should become as wise as
                    God himself; and accordingly, being invited by the beauty of the fruit, and its
                    desirable property of imparting wisdom, she plucked and ate; giving her husband
                    of it at the same time, who did likewise eat.</p>
                <p>Before this transgression of the divine command, Adam and his wife had no
                    occasion for clothes, neither had they any sense of shame; but immediately on
                    eating the forbidden fruit, they were ashamed of being naked, and made aprons of
                    fig-leaves for themselves. On hearing the voice of God in the garden, they were
                    terrified, and hid themselves: but being questioned by the Deity, they confessed
                    what they had done, and received sentence accordingly; the man being condemned
                    to labour, the woman to subjection to her husband, and to pain in childbearing.
                    They were now driven out of the garden, and their access to it prevented by a
                    terrible apparition.</p>
                <p>They had clothes given them by the Deity, made of the skins of beasts. In this
                    state Adam had several children: the names of only three of whom we are
                    acquainted with, viz. Cain, Abel, and Seth. He died at the age of 930 years.</p>
                <p>These are all the particulars concerning Adam that we have on divine authority;
                    but there is a vast multitude of others, all of them conjectural, part of them
                    downright falsehoods or absurdities. The curiosity of our readers, it is
                    presumed, will be sufficiently gratified by the few which are here
                    subjoined.</p>
                <p>According to the Talmudists, when Adam was created, his body was of immense
                    magnitude. When he sinned, his stature was reduced to a hundred ells, according
                    to some; to nine hundred cubits, according to others; who think this was done at
                    the request of the angels, who were afraid of so gigantic a creature.</p>
                <p>According to the <hi rend="italic">revelations</hi> of the famous Madame
                    Bourignon, Adam before his fall possessed in himself the principles of both
                    sexes, and the virtue or power of producing his like without the concurrent
                    assistance of woman. The division into two sexes, she imagined,<note

                    and now, she observes, mankind are become so many <hi rend="italic">monsters in

                    are capable of producing their like alone, and without pain of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193031564" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1564-0135"/>misery. She even imagined,
                    that being in an ecstasy, she saw the figure of Adam before he fell, with the
                    manner how, by himself, he was capable of procreating other men. “God,” says
                    she, “represented to my mind the beauty of the first world, and the manner how
                    he had drawn it from the chaos: every thing was bright, transparent, and darted
                    forth life and ineffable glory. The body of Adam was purer and more transparent
                    than crystal, and vastly fleet; through his body were seen vessels and rivulets
                    of light, which penetrated from the inward to the outward parts, through all his
                    pores. In some vessels ran fluids of all kinds and colours, vastly bright, and
                    quite diaphanous. The most ravishing harmony arose from every motion, and
                    nothing, resisted or could annoy him. His stature was taller than the present
                    race of men; his hair was short, curled, and of a colour inclining to black; his
                    upper lip covered with short hair; and instead of the bestial parts which
                    modesty will not allow us to name, he was fashioned as our bodies will be in the
                    eternal life, which I know not whether I dare reveal. In that <hi rend="italic"
                    >region</hi> his nose was formed after the manner of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >face,</hi> which diffused the most delicious fragrancy and perfumes; whence
                    also men were to issue, all whose principles were inherent in him; there being
                    in his belly a vessel where little eggs were formed, and a second vessel filled
                    with a fluid which impregnated those eggs; and when man heated himself in the
                    love of God, the desire he had that other creatures should exist beside himself,
                    to praise and love God, caused the fluid above mentioned (by means of the fire
                    of the love of God) to drop on one or more of these eggs, with inexpressible
                    delight; which being thus impregnated, issued, some time after, out of man by
                    this canal,<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><supplied

                    by insensible degrees. Woman was formed by taking out of Adam’s side the vessels
                    that contained the eggs; which she still possesses, as is discovered by
                    anatomists.”</p>
                <p>Many others have believed that Adam at his first creation was both male and
                    female; others, that he had two bodies joined together at the shoulders, and
                    their faces looking opposite ways, like those of Janus. Hence, say these, when
                    God created Eve, he had no more to do than to separate the two bodies from one
                    another. Of all others, however, the opinion of Paracelsus seems the most
                    ridiculous.<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><supplied

                <p>Extravagant things are asserted concerning Adam’s knowledge. Some rabbis, indeed,
                    have contented themselves with equalling it to that of Moses and Solomon; but
                    others have maintained that he excelled the angels themselves. Several
                    Christians seem to be little behind these Jews in the degree of knowledge they
                    ascribe to Adam; nothing being hid from him, according to them, except
                    contingent events relating to futurity. One writer indeed (Pinedo) excepts
                    politics; but a Carthusian friar, having exhausted in favour of Aristotle every
                    image and comparison he could think of, at last asserted that Aristotle’s
                    knowledge was as extensive as that of <hi rend="italic">Adam.</hi></p>
                <p>In consequence of this surprising knowledge with which Adam was endued, he is
                    supposed to have been a considerable author. The Jews pretend that he wrote a
                    book on the Creation, and another on the Deity. Some rabbis ascribe the 92d
                    psalm to him; and in some manuscripts the Chaldee title of this psalm expressly
                    declares that this is the song of praise which the first man repeated for the
                    Sabbath-day.</p>
                <p>Strange stories are told concerning Adam’s children. That he had none in the
                    state of innocence, is certain from Scripture; but that his marriage with Eve
                    was not consummated till after the fall, cannot be proved from thence. Some
                    imagine, that, for many years after the fall, Adam denied himself the connubial
                    joys by way of penance; others, that he cohabited with another woman, whose name
                    was <hi rend="smallcaps">Lillith.</hi> The Mahometans tell us, that our first
                    parents having been thrown headlong from the celestial paradise, Adam fell upon
                    the isle of Ser-endib, or Ceylon, in the East Indies; and Eve on Iodda, a port
                    of the Red Sea, not far from Mecca. After a separation of upwards of 200 years,
                    they met in Ceylon, where they multiplied: according to some Eve had twenty,
                    according to others only eight deliveries; bringing forth at each time twins, a
                    male and a female, who afterwards married. The rabbis imagine that Eve brought
                    forth Cain and Abel at a birth; that Adam wept for Abel a hundred years in the
                    valley of tears near Hebron, during which time he did not cohabit with his wife;
                    and that this separation would probably have continued longer, had it not been
                    forbid by the angel Gabriel. The inhabitants of Ceylon affirm, that the salt
                    lake on the mountain of Colombo consists wholly of the tears which Eve for one
                    hundred years together shed because of Abel’s death.</p>
                <p>Some of the Arabians tell us, that Adam was buried near Mecca, on Mount
                    Abukobeis; others, that Noah having laid his body in the ark, caused it to be
                    carried after the deluge to Jerusalem, by Melchizedek, the son of Shem: of this
                    opinion are the eastern Christians; but the Persians affirm that he was.interred
                    in the isle of Seren-dib, where his corpse was guarded by lions at the time the
                    giants warred upon one another. Some are of opinion that he was buried at
                    Jerusalem, on the place where Christ suffered, that so his bones might be
                    sprinkled with the Saviour’s blood.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adam,</hi><hi rend="italic">Alexander,</hi> Rector of the
                    High School, Edinburgh, and author of several valuable works connected with
                    Roman literature, was born on the 24th of June 1741, on a small farm which his
                    father rented, not far from Forres, in Morayshire. He does not appear to have
                    received any powerful direction to literary pursuits, either from the
                    attainments of his parents or the ability of the parochial schoolmaster; but is
                    referable to a class of men, of which Scotland can produce a very honourable
                    list, whom the secret workings of a naturally active mind have raised above the
                    level of their associates, and urged on to distinction and usefulness under the
                    severest pressure of difficulties. The gentle treatment of an old schooloustress
                    first taught him to like his book; and this propensity induced his parents to
                    consent that he should learn Latin. To the imperfect instruction which he
                    received at the parish school, he joined indefatigable study at home,
                    notwithstanding the scanty means and poor accommodation of his father’s house.
                    Before he was sixteen, he had read the whole of Livy, in a copy of the small
                    Elzevir edition, which he had borrowed from a neighbouring clergyman; omitting
                    for the present all such passages as his own sagacity and Cole’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> did not enable him to construe. It was before
                    day-break, during the mornings of winter, and by the light of splinters of
                    boxwood dug out of an adjoining moss, that he prosecuted the perusal of this
                    difficult classic; for, as the whole family were collected round the only fire
                    in the evening, he was prevented by the noise from reading with any advantage;
                    and the day-light was spent at school.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1757, he was a competitor for one of those bursaries, or small
                    exhibitions, which are given by the university of Aberdeen to young men who
                    distinguish themselves for their classical attainments; but as the prize was
                    awarded to the best written exercises, and as Adam, with all his reading, had
                    not yet been accustomed to write <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031577"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1577-0136"/>he was foiled by some youth who had been more
                    fortunate in his means of instruction. About the same time Mr Watson, a relation
                    of his mother’s, and one of the ministers of the Canongate, sent him a tardy
                    invitation to come to Edinburgh, “provided he was prepared to endure every
                    hardship for a season,”—a condition not likely to appal one who yet knew nothing
                    of life but its hardships. The interest of Mr Watson procured him free admission
                    to the lectures of the different professors; and as he had now also access to
                    books in the College Library, his literary ardour made him submit with
                    cheerfulness to the greatest personal privations. Eighteen months of assiduous
                    application enabled him to repair the defects of his early tuition, and to
                    obtain, after a. comparative trial of candidates, the head mastership of the
                    foundation known by the name of Watson’s Hospital. At this period he was only
                    nineteen, on which account the governors of the institution limited the
                    appointment to half a year; but his steadiness and ability speedily removed
                    their scruples. After holding the situation for three years, he was induced, by
                    the prospect of having more leisure for the prosecution of his studies, to
                    resign it, and become private tutor to the son of Mr Kincaid, a wealthy citizen,
                    and afterwards Lord Provost of Edinburgh; and it was in consequence of this
                    connection that he was afterwards raised to the office for which he was so
                    eminently qualified. He taught in the High School, for the first time, in April
                    1765, as substitute for Mr Matheson the rector; in consequence of whose growing
                    infirmities, an arrangement was made, by which he retired on a small annuity, to
                    be paid from the profits of the class; and Mr Adam was confirmed in the
                    rectorship on the 8th of June 1768.</p>
                <p>From this period the history of his life is little more than the history of his
                    professional labours and of his literary productions. No sooner was he invested
                    with the office, than he gave himself up with entire devotion to the business of
                    his class, and the pursuits connected with it. For forty years his day was
                    divided with singular regularity between the public duties of teaching and that
                    unwearied research and industry in private which enabled him, amidst the
                    incessant occupation of a High School master’s life, to give to the world such a
                    number of accurate and laborious compilations. So entirely did these objects of
                    public utility engross his mind, that he mixed but little with society, and
                    considered every moment as lost that was not dedicated in some way or other to
                    the improvement of youth. Few men certainly could adopt, with more truth and
                    propriety, the language of Horace, both with regard to his own feelings and the
                    objects on which he was occupied:</p>

                <p>The rector’s class, which in the High School is the most advanced of five,
                    consisted of no more than between thirty and forty boys when Dr Adam was
                    appointed. His celebrity as a classical teacher, joined to the progress of the
                    country in wealth and population, continued to increase this number up to the
                    year of his death. His class-list for that year contained 167 names,—the largest
                    number that had ever been collected in one class, and, what is remarkable, equal
                    to the amount of the whole five classes during the year when he first taught in
                    the school.</p>
                <p>He performed an essential service to the literature of his country by
                    introducing, in his own class, an additional hour of teaching for Greek and
                    Geography; neither of which branches seems to have been contemplated in the
                    original formation of the school. The introduction of Greek, which he effected a
                    year or two after his election,' was regarded by some professors of the
                    university as a dangerous innovation, and an unwarrantable encroachment on the
                    province of the Greek chair; and the measure was accordingly resisted (though,
                    it is satisfactory to think, unsuccessfully) by the united efforts of the
                    Senatus Academicus, in a petition and representation to the towncouncil, drawn
                    up and proposed by the celebrated Principal of the university, Dr Robertson.
                    This happened in 1772.</p>
                <p>It is not possible for a man of principle and ordinary affections to be occupied
                    in training a large portion of the youth of his country to knowledge and virtue,
                    without feeling a deep responsibility, and a paramount interest in their
                    progress and welldoing. That such were Dr Adam’s feelings is proved, not less by
                    the whole tenor of his life, than by his mode of conducting the business of his
                    class; by the free scope and decided support he gave to talent, particularly
                    when the possessor of it was poor and friendless; by the tender concern with
                    which he followed his pupils into life; and by a test not the least unequivocal,
                    the enthusiastic attachment and veneration which they entertain for his memory.
                    In his class-room, his manner, while it imposed respect, was kindly and
                    conciliating. He was fond of relieving the irksomeness of continued attention by
                    narrating curious facts and amusing anecdotes. In the latter part of his life,
                    he was perhaps too often the hero of his own tale; but there was something
                    amiable even in this weakness, which arose from the vanity of having done much
                    good, and was totally unmixed with any alloy of selfishness.</p>
                <p>Dr Adam’s first publication was his <hi rend="italic">Grammar,</hi> which
                    appeared in 1772. He had two principal objects in compiling it;—to combine the
                    study of English and Latin grammar, so that they might mutually illustrate each
                    other; and to supersede the preposterous method of teaching Latin by a grammar
                    composed in that language, and of overloading the memory with rules in Latin
                    hexameters, for almost every fact and every anomaly in its grammatical
                    structure. The change he proposed, reasonable as it was, could not be effected
                    without running counter to confirmed prejudices, and interfering with
                    established books. Although, therefore, the grammar met with the approbation of
                    some eminently good judges, particularly of Bishop Lowth, the author had no
                    sooner adopted it in his own class, and recommended it to others, than a host of
                    enemies rose up against him, and he was involved in much altercation and
                    vexatious hostility with the towncouncil and the four under masters. Dr George
                    Stewart, then professor of humanity, was related to Ruddiman, whose grammar Dr
                    Adam’s was intended to supersede; and to this cause may be traced the
                    commencement of the determined opposition that was long made to any change. In
                    these squabbles, the acrimony displayed by some of his adversaries now and then
                    altered the natural suavity of Dr Adam’s temper; and his high notions of
                    independence, and contempt of presumptuous ignorance, led him perhaps to neglect
                    too much those easy arts of conciliation, which enable a man, without the
                    slightest compromise of his integrity, “to win his way by yielding to the
                    tide.”</p>
                <p>His work on <hi rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</hi> was published in 1791, and
                    has contributed, more than any of his other productions, to give him a name as a
                    classical scholar. Ţhe vast variety of matter, the minuteness and accuracy of
                    the details, the number and fidelity of the references, the constant bearing the
                    work has upon the classics, and the light it throws on them at every step, were
                    soon perceived and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031590"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1590-0137"/>appreciated over the whole island. These solid
                    excellencies abundantly compensate for a certain air of heaviness, and the
                    absence of the lighter graces of interesting style and manner. His reader
                    follows him as he would do a faithful guide, through a strange and difficult
                    country, with a feeling of perfect assurance that he will arrive at the end of
                    his journey, if not by the pleasantest road, at least by the most direct and
                    secure. The <hi rend="italic">Roman Antiquities</hi> is now adopted as a
                    class-book in many of the English schools; and, even in those where the
                    influence of custom opposes innovation, it is found in every master’s library,
                    and recommended by him to his advanced pupils for private reading and
                    reference.</p>
                <p>In 1794 he published his <hi rend="italic">Summary of Geography and History,</hi>
                    in one thick 8vo volume of 900 pages, which had grown in his hands to this size
                    from a small treatise on the same subject, printed for the use of his pupils in
                    1784. The object of this work was to connect the study of the classics with that
                    of general knowledge; and it accordingly contains a curious compound of
                    interesting matter, unwieldy as a school-book, and not always arranged in the
                    most luminous or engaging order, but valuable to the young student for its
                    succinct account of the first principles of astronomical, mathematical, and
                    physical science, and for the mass it contains of geographical and historical
                    information, especially with regard to the fabulous ages of antiquity.</p>
                <p>His <hi rend="italic">Classical Biography,</hi> published in 1800, is the least
                    in request of all his works; a circumstance owing, perhaps, to the more
                    comprehensive and popular plan of Lempriere’s <hi rend="italic">Classical
                    Dictionary.</hi> It exhibits, however, ample proofs of well-directed industry;
                    and in the number and unfailing accuracy of the references, furnishes an
                    excellent index to the best sources of information, even where the book itself
                    may be thought meagre and scanty.</p>
                <p>His last work was his <hi rend="italic">Latin Dictionary,</hi> which appeared in
                    1805, printed, like every other production of his pen, in the most unassuming
                    form, and with the utmost anxiety to condense the greatest quantity of useful
                    knowledge into the smallest bulk, and afford it to the student at the cheapest
                    rate. It was intended chiefly for the use of schools, and to be followed by a
                    larger work, containing copious illustrations of every word in the language. The
                    character which he had acquired by his former works for patient research and
                    correct detail stamped a high and deserved authority on this book. The clear
                    account of the different meanings of words, the explanation of idioms, and happy
                    translation of difficult passages, which abound, particularly in the latter
                    half, are admirably well adapted to remove the difficulties of the younger
                    student, and render the work, notwithstanding the modesty of its pretensions,
                    equally valuable to the more advanced. It is much to be regretted he did not
                    live to complete his larger work on the extended scale on which the latter part
                    of the small one is executed. He had proceeded as far as the word <hi
                    rend="italic">Comburo,</hi> with a plenitude of illustration that would have
                    made the work a treasure of Latinity, when he was seized in school with an
                    apoplectic affection; occasioned, perhaps, by the intenseness of his
                    application, and the small portion of sleep he allowed himself,—certainly not by
                    his mode of living, which was simple and abstemious to an extreme degree. He
                    lingered five days under the disease. Amidst the wanderings of mind that
                    accompanied it, he was constantly reverting to the business of the class, and
                    addressing his boys; and in the last hour of his life, as he fancied himself
                    examining on the lesson of the day, he stopped short, and said, “But it grows
                    dark, you may go and almost immediately expired. He died on the 18th of December
                    1809, at the age of 68.</p>
                <p>The magistrates of Edinburgh, whose predecessors had not always been alive to his
                    merits, showed their respect for his memory by a public funeral. A short time
                    before his death, he was solicited by some of his old pupils to sit to Mr
                    Raeburn for his portrait, which was executed in the best style of that eminent
                    artist, and placed, as a memorial of their gratitude and respect, in the library
                    of the High School.</p>
                <p>He was twice married; first in 1775, to Miss Munro, eldest daughter of the
                    minister of Kinloss, by whom he had several children, the last of whom died
                    within a few days of his father; and in 1789, to Miss Cosser, daughter of Mr
                    Cosser, Comptroller of Excise, who, with two daughters and a son, are still
                    alive. <hi rend="smallcaps">(h.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Adam,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Melchior,</hi> lived in the seventeenth century. He was born in
                    the territory of Grotkaw in Silesia, and educated in the college of Brieg, where
                    he became a firm Protestant, and was enabled to pursue his studies by the
                    liberality of a person of quality, who had left several exhibitions for young
                    students. He was appointed rector of a college at Heidelberg, where he
                    published, in the year 1615, the first volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vitae</hi><hi rend="italic">Germanorum Philosophorum,</hi> &amp;c. This volume,
                    which treated of philosophers, poets, writers on polite literature, and
                    historians, &amp;c. was followed by three others: that which treated of divines
                    was printed in 1619; that of the lawyers came next; and, finally, that of the
                    physicians: the last two were published in 1620. All the learned men whose lives
                    are contained in these four volumes lived in the sixteenth or beginning of the
                    seventeenth century, and are either Germans or Flemings; but he published in
                    1618 the lives of twenty divines of other countries in a separate volume,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Decades duae,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >continentes</hi><hi rend="italic">Vitas</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologorum

                    The Lutherans were not pleased with him, for they thought him partial, and will
                    not allow his work to be a proper standard of the learning of Germany. He was
                    the author of some other works of less consequence than his Lives. His industry
                    as a biographer is commended by Bayle, who acknowledges his obligations to his
                    labours. He died in 1622.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adam,</hi><hi rend="italic">Robert,</hi> an eminent
                    architect, was born at Edinburgh in the year 1728. He was the second son of
                    William Adam, Esq. of Maryburgh, in the county of Fife, who has also left some
                    respectable specimens of his genius and abilities as an architect in
                    Hopetoun-house and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, which were erected from
                    designs executed by him. And it was perhaps owing to the fortunate circumstance
                    of his father’s example that young Adam first directed his attention to those
                    studies, in the prosecution of which he afterwards rose to such distinguished
                    celebrity. He received his education at the university of Edinburgh, where he
                    had an opportunity of improving and enlarging his mind, by the conversation and
                    acquaintance of some of the first literary characters of the age, who were then
                    rising into reputation, or have since established their fame as historians and
                    philosophers. Among these were Mr Hume, Dr Robertson, Dr Smith, and Dr Ferguson,
                    who were the friends and companions of the father, and who continued through
                    life their friendship and attachment to the son.</p>
                <p>In the year 1754, Mr Adam travelled to the Continent, with a view to extend his
                    knowledge and improve his taste in architecture, and resided in Italy for three
                    years. Here he surveyed and studied those noble specimens of ancient grandeur
                    which the magnificent public edifices of the Romans, even in ruins, still
                    exhibit. In tracing the progress of architecture and the other fine arts among
                    the Romans, Mr Adam observed that they had visibly declined <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193031603" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1603-0138"/>previously to the time of
                    Dioclesian; but he was also convinced that the liberal patronage and munificence
                    of that emperor had revived, during his reign, a better taste for architecture,
                    and had formed artists who were capable of imitating the more elegant style of a
                    purer age. He had seen this remarkably exemplified in the public baths at Rome,
                    which were erected by him, the most entire and the noblest of the ancient
                    buildings. Admiring the extent and fertility of genius of the artists from whose
                    designs such magnificent structures had been executed, he was anxious to see and
                    study any remains that yet existed of those masters whose works were striking
                    monuments of an elegant and improved taste, but whose names, amid the wrecks of
                    time, have sunk into oblivion. It was with this view that he undertook a voyage
                    to Spalatro, in Dalmatia, to visit and examine the private palace of Dioelesian,
                    in which that emperor resided for nine years previous to his death, and to which
                    he retired in the year 305, when he resigned the government of the empire. Mr
                    Adam sailed from Venice in July 1754, accompanied by Μ. Clerisseau, a French
                    artist and antiquary, and two experienced draughtsmen. On their arrival at
                    Spalatro, they found, that though the palace had suffered much from the injuries
                    of time, yet it had sustained no less from the dilapidations of the inhabitants
                    to procure materials for building; and even the foundations of the ancient
                    structure were covered with modern houses. With high expectations of success
                    they commenced their labours, but were soon interrupted by the jealous vigilance
                    of the government. Suspecting that their object was to view and make plans of
                    the fortifications, an immediate and peremptory order was issued by the
                    governor, commanding them to desist. This order, however, was soon counteracted
                    through the mediation of General Graeme, the eommander-in-chief of the Venetian
                    forces; and they were permitted to proceed in their undertaking. They resumed
                    their labours with double ardour, and in five weeks finished plans and views of
                    the fragments which remain, from which they were enabled to execute perfect
                    designs of the entire building.</p>
                <p>Mr Adam now returned to England, and soon rose to very considerable professional
                    eminence. In 1762 he was appointed architect to the king; and the year following
                    he presented to the public the fruit of his voyage to Spalatro, in a splendid
                    work, containing engravings and descriptions of the ruins of the palace. “For
                    the account of Dioclesian’s palace,” says Mr Gibbon, “we are indebted to an
                    ingenious artist of our own time and country, whom a very liberal curiosity had
                    carried into the heart of Dalmatia. But there is room to suspect that the
                    elegance of his designs and engravings has somewhat flattered the objects which
                    it was their purpose to represent. We are informed by a more recent and very
                    judicious traveller, the Abbé Fortis, that the awful ruins of Spalatro are not
                    less expressive of the decline of the arts than of the greatness of the Roman
                    empire in the time of Dioelesian.” Upon this we may observe, that Mr Adam
                    allows, that previously to this period of the Roman empire the arts had visibly
                    declined: and only contends, that the buildings erected in the reign of
                    Dioelesian exhibit convincing proofs of the style and manner of a purer age.</p>
                <p>In the year 1768, Mr Adam obtained a seat in parliament. He was chosen to
                    represent the county of Kinross; and about the same time he resigned his office
                    of architect to the king. But he continued his professional career with
                    increasing reputation; and about the year 1773, in conjunction with his brother
                    James, who also rose to considerable eminence as an architect, he published
                    another splendid work, consisting of plans and elevations of public and private
                    buildings which were erected from their designs. Among these are, Lord
                    Mansfield’s house at Caenwood; Luton-house in Bedfordshire, belonging to Lord
                    Bute; the new Gateway of the Admiralty Office; the Register Office at Edinburgh,
                    &amp;c.; which are universally admired as precious monuments of elegant design
                    and correct taste. The Adelphi buildings at London, which are also striking
                    examples of the inventive genius of the Messrs Adam, proved an unsuccessful
                    speculation. The wealth and power of a nation only were equal to so extensive an
                    undertaking; it was too great to be attempted by private citizens.</p>
                <p>The buildings more lately erected from the designs of Mr Adam afford additional
                    proofs of his invention and skill. We may mention in particular the Infirmary of
                    Glasgow, as exhibiting the most perfect symmetry and useful disposition of
                    parts, combined with great beauty and lightness.</p>
                <p>To the last period of his life Mr Adam displayed an increasing vigour of genius
                    and refinement of taste; for, in the space of one year preceding his death, he
                    designed eight great public works, besides twenty-five private buildings, so
                    various in their style and beautiful in their composition, that they have been
                    allowed, by the best judges, sufficient of themselves to establish his fame. The
                    improved taste which now pretty generally prevails in our public and private
                    edifices, undoubtedly owes much to the elegant and correct style introduced by
                    this distinguished artist.</p>
                <p>He died on the 3d of March 1792, by the bursting of a blood-vessel, in the 64th
                    year of his age, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. The natural suavity of his
                    manners, joined to the excellence of his moral character, secured to him the
                    affectionate regard of his friends,« and the esteem of all who enjoyed his
                    acquaintance. James Adam, already mentioned as associated with his brother in
                    many of his labours, died on the 20th October 1794.</p>
