            <div facs="nls:193031512?mode=fullsize" type="entry">
                <p><label type="entry">ACTION</label>, in a general sense, implies nearly the same
                    thing with Act. Grammarians, however, observe some distinction between <hi
                    rend="italic">action</hi> and <hi rend="italic">act</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    the former being generally restricted to the common or ordinary transactions,
                    whereas the latter is used to express those which are remarkable. Thus, we say
                    it is a good <hi rend="italic">action</hi> to comfort the unhappy; it is a
                    generous <hi rend="italic">act</hi> to deprive ourselves of what is necessary
                    for their sake. The wise man proposes to himself an honest end in all his
                    actions; a prince ought to mark every day of his life with some act of
                    greatness. The Abbé Girard makes a further distinction between the words <hi
                    rend="italic">action</hi> and <hi rend="italic">act.</hi> The former, according
                    to him, has more relation to the power that acts than the latter; whereas the
                    latter has more relation to the effect produced than the former: and hence the
                    one is properly the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031525?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1525-0132"/> attribute of the other. Thus, we may properly
                    say, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> Be sure to preserve a presence of mind in
                    all your actions, and take care that they be all acts of equity.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Action,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Commerce,</hi> is a term
                    used abroad for a certain part or share of a public company’s capital stock.
                    Thus, if a company has 400,000 livres capital stock, this may be divided into
                    400 actions, each consisting of 1000 livres. Hence a man is said to have two,
                    four, &amp;c. actions, according as he has property of 2000, 4000, &amp;c.
                    livres capital stock. The transferring of actions abroad is performed much in
                    the same manner as stocks are with us.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Action,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Mechanics,</hi> implies
                    either the effort which a body or power makes against another body or power, or
                    the effect itself of that effort.</p>
                <p>As it is necessary, in works of this kind, to have a particular regard to the
                    common language of mechanics and philosophers, we have given this double
                    definition; but the proper signification of the term is the motion which a body
                    really produces, or tends to produce, in another; that is, such is the motion it
                    would have produced had nothing hindered its effect.</p>
                <p>All power is nothing more than a body actually in motion, or which tends to move
                    itself; that is, a body which would move' itself if nothing opposed it. The
                    action therefore of a body is rendered evident to us by its motion only; and
                    consequently we must not fix any other idea to the word action than that of
                    actual motion, or a simple tendency to motion. The famous question relating to
                    <hi rend="italic">vis viva</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mortua</hi> owes, in all probability, its existence to an inadequate idea of
                    the word action; for had Leibnitz and his followers observed that the only
                    precise and distinct idea we can give to the word force or action reduces it to
                    its effect, that is, to the motion it actually produces or tends to produce,
                    they would never have made that curious distinction.</p>

                    name given by Μ. de Mauper-tuis, in the Memoirs of the Parisian Academy of
                    Sciences for 1744, and those of Berlin for 1746, to the product of the mass of a
                    body by the space which it runs through, and by its celerity. He lays it down as
                    a general law, that, “in the changes made in the state of a body, the quantity
                    of action necessary to produce such change is the least possible.” This
                    principle he applies to the investigation of the laws of refraction, of
                    equilibrium, &amp;c. and even to the ways of acting employed by the Supreme
                    Being. In this manner Μ. de Maupertuis attempts to connect the metaphysics of
                    final causes with the fundamental truths of mechanics; to show the dependence of
                    the collision of both elastic and hard bodies upon one and the same law, which
                    before had always been referred to separate laws; and to reduce the laws of
                    motion and those of equilibrium to one and the same principle.</p>

                    they seem to be really actuated by passions. Thus, we say, the action of such a
                    figure finely expresses the passions with which it is agitated; we also use the

                    rend="italic">vital</hi> functions, or actions, are those which are absolutely
                    necessary to life, and without which there is no life; as the action of the
                    heart, lungs, and arteries. On the action and re-action of the solids and fluids
                    on each other, depend the vital functions. The pulse and respiration are the
                    external signs of life. Vital diseases are all those which hinder the influx of
                    the venous blood into the cavities of the heart, and the expulsion of the
                    arterial blood from the same.—The <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> functions are
                    those which are instrumental in repairing the several losses which the body
                    sustains; for life is destructive of itself, its very offices occasioning a
                    perpetual waste. The manducation of food, the deglutition and digestion thereof
                    also the separation and distribution of the chyle and excrementitious parts,
                    &amp;c. are under the head of natural functions, as by these our aliment is
                    converted into our nature. They are necessary to the continuance of our
                    bodies.—The <hi rend="italic">animal</hi> functions are those which we perform
                    at will, as muscular motion, and all .the voluntary actions of the body: they
                    are those which constitute the senses of touch, taste, smell, sight, hearing,
                    perception, reasoning, imagination, memory, judgment, affections of the mind.
                    Without any or all of them a man may live, but not so comfortably as with
