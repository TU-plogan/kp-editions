                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    Italian lady, who may be justly pronounced one of the greatest wonders and
                    ornaments of her sex, was born at Milan, on the 16th of May 1718. Our materials
                    for an account of this celebrated female arc by no means so complete, nor in
                    some interesting particulars so distinct, as we could have wished. Not having

                    have been obliged to content ourselves with some shorter notices, the most
                    detailed of which is that contained in Mazzuchclli’s <hi rend="italic">History
                    of the Writers of Italy,</hi> a work published during the earlier but more
                    brilliant period of her life. The accounts which this writer and some others
                    have given of the intellectual capacities and endowments which she displayed in
                    early youth, call to ‘mind the wonders which have been related of Picus of
                    Mirandula and the Admirable Crichton; nor does there seem any reason to doubt
                    their authenticity. At nine years of. age she not only spoke the Latin language
                    with precision, but even composed and delivered an oration in that language,
                    intended to prove that the cultivation of letters is not incompatible with the
                    female character. This singular piece was published at Milan the same year in
                    which it was spoken, with the following title: <hi rend="italic">Oratio,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">qua</hi><hi rend="italic">ostenditur artium liberalium
                    studia</hi><hi rend="italic">a faemineo</hi><hi rend="italic">sexu neutiquam
                    abhorrere, habita a Maria de Agnesiis, rhetoricae operam dante,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">anno octatis</hi><hi rend="italic">sure nono nondum exacto,
                    die</hi> 18 <hi rend="italic">Augusti</hi> 1727.</p>
                <p>At eleven years of age she spoke Greek with all the fluency of her native tongue.
                    When yet very young, she had also acquired some of the languages of the East;
                    and, in a word, her acquisitions as a linguist were such as to procure for her
                    the appellation of a <hi rend="italic">Walking Polyglot.</hi> But her aptitude
                    for acquiring languages, however great, was by no means the only, or the most
                    striking feature of her intellectual character. We have seen how early she
                    essayed the discussion of a general question affecting the mental capacities of
                    her sex; and the vigour and acuteness displayed in this aspiring essay were, ere
                    long, exerted with ardour and success in scientific inquiries. Having gone
                    through the elementary branches of mathematics, she proceeded with alacrity to
                    the study of natural philosophy; and she seems also to have carried her
                    researches into the obscurer regions of metaphysical speculation.</p>
                <p>About the time when she reached her fifteenth year, her father formed a select
                    assembly of the learned of Milan; and at these meetings, which were held in his
                    house, at stated times, for several years, Agnesi maintained a succession of <hi
                    rend="italic">Theses</hi> on various points of speculation and philosophy. The
                    ability which she displayed on these occasions seems to have been altogether
                    surprising; and the effect was not the less, that her person was agreeable, and
                    her whole deportment gentle and prepossessing. We are indebted to the learned
                    president De Brosses for the following account of one of these conferences, at
                    which he assisted during his travels in Italy, through the introduction of Count
                    Belloni. “I had conceived,” says he, “when I went to this <hi rend="italic"
                    >conversazione,</hi> that it was only to talk with this young lady in the usual
                    way, though on learned subjects; but to my surprise Belloni addressed her in a
                    fine Latin harangue, with all the formality of an academic oration. She replied
                    in the same language with promptness and ability; and they proceeded, still in,
                    Latin, to discuss the origin of fountains, and the causes of the ebbings and
                    flowings observed in some of them. She spoke like an angel on this subject, and
                    I never heard it treated so much to my satisfaction. We then discoursed with her
                    concerning the manner in which the soul receives impressions from outward
                    objects, and their conveyance to the general <hi rend="italic">sensorium,</hi>
                    the brain; and afterwards upon the propagation of light, and the prismatic
                    colours. - The conversation afterwards became general, every one speaking to her
                    in the language of his own country, and she answering in the same.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lettres sur l’Italie,</hi> tom. i. p. 243.) But Agnesi seems to
                    nave taken but little delight in the glory which she acquired as a philosophical
                    disputant. Her temper was retired and devout, and she appears to have acted this
                    part more to gratify her father than herself. About her twentieth year she
                    accordingly withdrew from these assemblies, and for a long period devoted the
                    greater part of her time to mathematical studies. The Theses which she had
                    maintained with so ’ much applause were published in a quarto volume, under -the
                    following title: <hi rend="italic">Propositiones</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophiere,'</hi><hi rend="italic">quas crebris disputationibus domi

                <p>The first fruit of her mathematical studies was a Commentary on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Conic Sections</hi> of the Marquis de 1’Hôpital; but this piece
                    she would never consent to publish, though Mazzuchclli says that it was greatly
                    praised by many who had perused the manuscript. In the course of a few years,
                    however, she gave to the world a mathematical work, which must ever secure her a
                    high rank among the most distinguished cultivators of abstract science. This
                    work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Instituzioni Analitiche ad uso della Gioventu
                    Italiana,</hi> was published at Milan in 1748, in two volumes quarto. The first
                    volume treats of the analysis of finite quantities; the second, of the analysis
                    of infinitesimals. These two volumes contain a full and satisfactory view of
                    this branch of mathematical science in the state at which it had then arrived;
                    and though improvements have since that time been introduced, the treatise of
                    Agnesi, according to a very competent authority, may still be regarded as
                    perhaps the best introduction that is to be found to the works of Euler and the
                    other mathematicians of the Continent. <hi rend="italic">(Edinb. Review,</hi>
                    vol. iii. p. 408.) An English translation of this work was long ago executed by
                    the late Professor Colson of Cambridge; but the manuscript lay buried in
                    obscurity for many years, and was only published in 1801, through the care and
                    at the expense of Baron Maseres.</p>
                <p>Besides other literary honours which followed the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Analytical Institutions,</hi> Agnesi was, in 1750, appointed
                    professor of mathematics and natural philosophy in the university of Bologna.
                    The appointment of a young female, of thirty-two years of age, to such a charge,
                    must appear to many as not a little singular; but the truth is, that female
                    professors were by no means uncommon in Italy; and Lalande mentions several as
                    having been eminent in the same university, one of whom was professor of
                    anatomy. <hi rend="italic">( Voyage</hi><hi rend="italic">en Italie,</hi> tom.
                    ii.) Our scanty information does not enable us to state whether Agnesi ever
                    entered upon the active duties of the mathematical chair. Though her life was
                    long, we can add but little in regard to her after-history. She died, according
                    to the meagre notice contained in the <hi rend="italic">Biographie
                    Universelle,</hi> in the year 1799. Her mistaken notions of religious duty
                    rendered the greater part of her existence but a blank to the world. She had
                    early expressed a wish to retire into a convent, and seems to have carried this
                    design into effect not long after the period when her great work procured for
                    her the honours to which we have just alluded. We afterwards hear of her only as
                    a devoted sister of the austere order of <hi rend="italic">Blue Nuns,</hi>
                    repelling the approaches of those of the learned who still desired to converse
                    with her, and thus exhibiting another melancholy instance of the inconsistencies
                    of our nature, and the darkening power of superstition over the brightest minds.
                    But she lived long enough for the world to vindicate the intellectual capacities
                    of her sex,—to show that the female mind is not only fitted for the lighter
                    exercises of literature, but capable also of fathoming the depths and
                    unravelling the intricacies of abstract science. If there are any, therefore,
                    whose speculations may have led them to more depreciating conclusions, let them,
                    to use the words of a profound and eloquent writer already quoted in this
                    article, “peruse the long series of demonstrations which the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Analytical Institutions</hi> has contrived with so much skill, and
                    explained with such elegance and perspicuity: if they are able to do so, they
                    will probably retract their former opinions; if unable, they will not of course
                    see the reasons for admiring her genius that others do; but they may at least
                    learn to think modestly of their own.” <hi rend="italic">(Edinb. Rev.</hi> vol.
                    iii. p. 410.)</p>
