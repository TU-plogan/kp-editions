                <p><label type="entry">AMBOYNA</label>, an island in the eastern seas, and the chief
                    of the Molucca Islands. It is between 50 and 60 miles in length, and is divided
                    into two unequal parts by two deep bays, which are separated only by a narrow
                    isthmus of one mile across. The bay on the west side extends to about two thirds
                    of the length of the island, and forms a commodious and safe harbour. That on
                    the east side is much smaller, and, as a harbour, very insecure, both on account
                    of its bad anchorage and its rocky shores. The larger division is called Hitoo,
                    and the smaller division Letymor. Although the larger bay is more commodious for
                    a settlement, it is in the Letymor division that the Europeans have chosen to
                    fix their residence. Amboyna has long been the seat of the supreme government of
                    the Spice Islands; and under its jurisdiction are comprehended ten other
                    islands, namely, Ceram, which is equal in size to all the rest, Ceram Laut,
                    Bouro, Amblaw, Manipa, Kelang, Bonoa, Harakau, Saparoua,’ and Noossa Laut.</p>
                <p>Amboyna is of a hot but salubrious climate. It is subject to the monsoons; but
                    they so far differ in this island from those experienced in Java, Borneo,
                    Celebes, &amp;c. that the southerly monsoon, which is accompanied with such fine
                    weather in these islands, occasions in Amboyna incessant rains, thunder,
                    lightning, and hurricanes. This tempestuous weather extends westward to the
                    strait which separates the islands of Salayer and Celebes, where it ceases, and
                    the sky assumes a serene appearance. Am-boyna is occasionally liable to
                    earthquakes. The surface is diversified with lofty ridges of mountains; and
                    during the rainy seasons the smallest rivulets are swelled into torrents, which
                    overflow their channels, and rush down the steep sides of the mountains,
                    carrying away the strongest bridges, and every other obstacle which opposes the
                    impetuous current. The soil and climate of Amboyna are adapted for a variety of
                    vegetable products of great value; but it has been chiefly famed for the produce
                    of the nutmeg and the clove-tree. The cultivation of the nutmeg has been for
                    some years prohibited in Amboyna, the industry of its inhabitants being chiefly
                    directed to the rearing of the clove-tree. It is only in Amboyna and the three
                    islands of Harakau, Saparoua, and Noossa Laut, that cloves are now
                    cultivated.</p>
                <p>“The clove-tree grows to the height of about forty or fifty feet, its branches
                    spread, and its leaves are long and pointed. In a favourable soil it begins to
                    bear at fifteen years’ growth, is in perfection at twenty, and continues to
                    bear, without any apparent decay, till the age of forty or fifty. Some trees
                    yield thirty pounds of cloves; but the average quantity produced does not amount
                    to more than six pounds a tree. They grow to the greatest perfection in deep
                    valleys, well sheltered by hills and woods, and in a soil of a rich black mould,
                    quite dry, though they require frequent rains for the greatest part of the year,
                    and very hot weather at the gathering season, which commences generally about
                    the latter end of October or the beginning of November, and continues until
                    February. In April and May there is an after-crop, but of a very inferior
                    quality.” <hi rend="italic">(Asiatic Annual</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Dutch East India Company appear to have been actuated by the same sordid,
                    narrow, and oppressive views which have, in a greater or less degree,
                    characterized all the European governments established in the east. Cloves, the
                    great article of produce throughout the island, are rigorously engrossed for the
                    benefit of the Company. And for the convenience of this monopoly, the province
                    and its dependencies are divided into several districts, over which residents or
                    governors are appointed, for the purpose of preventing all contraband trade, and
                    to take care <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037570" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7570-0597"
                    />also that the whole produce of the country is strictly delivered up at a fixed
                    price. The governor has under his immediate management seven great and
                    twenty-four small districts; and the subordinate residents have committed to
                    them from six to ten districts, with the exception of. the resident of Saparoua,
                    who has under his superintendence twenty-four districts. These districts are
                    likewise called regencies; and the officers who govern them are distinguished by
                    the names of Regents, Rajahs, Patties, and Orankaios. Several of these regencies
                    are hereditary, and are enjoyed by the lineal descendants of the Portuguese
                    families who first settled in the island; all the others are appointed by the
                    governor, although in this respect he is obliged to regulate his choice by the
                    ancient customs and prejudices of the people, whose reverence for the ties of
                    consanguinity carries them so far as to induce them to keep a regular pedigree
                    of their families, which is registered in the secretary’s office, and on which
                    the candidate for a vacant regency rests his primary claim. The regents are the
                    vassals of the company, who not only claim the sovereignty of the island, but
                    the actual property of the soil; the whole of the lands being in their immediate
                    possession, except a few pieces of ground belonging to burghers and private
                    persons, who, under the prohibition of cultivating the clove-tree, are permitted
                    to alienate them. But notwithstanding this claim of a paramount right in the
                    soil, they still so far acknowledge the rights of individuals to certain
                    districts, that they do not attempt to deprive them of their property without
                    compensation; especially if their lands produce clove-trees, which, being
                    considered the peculiar inheritance of the planters, are held to be
                    inviolable.</p>
                <p>It is only in the districts marked out by the state that the cultivation of
                    cloves is permitted; and the grounds which are appropriated for this purpose are
                    portioned out to the inhabitants. These grounds are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Daty-lands</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a regular register of the produce of
                    them is kept, the clove-trees are numbered once a year, and their qualities
                    particularly noted. The people are bound, under pain of death, to deliver the
                    entire produce of these trees annually into the company’s stores. Where
                    clove-trees flourish spontaneously without the limits of the lands appointed for
                    their cultivation, an account of them is immediately taken, and inserted in the
                    register; and where young trees shoot up, they are immediately transplanted into
                    <hi rend="italic">Daty-lands</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> unless the
                    number of trees in them is already sufficient.</p>
                <p>To enforce the law for cutting down all the clove-trees, which, from the
                    spontaneous bounty of nature, may shoot up in different parts of the island, an
                    annual circuit is made by the governor, accompanied by a detachment of troops
                    and such of the gentlemen of the settlement as he may appoint to accompany him.
                    As this expedition is performed by water, it is escorted by a number of the
                    regents of the districts in their barges, which they are obliged to equip at
                    their own expense. The governor generally sets out in the middle of October,
                    attended by all the residents of those districts under the immediate management
                    of the supreme government. As he proceeds, he calls on the attendance of all the
                    principal people of the district through which he passes. In this manner he
                    makes a tour through his whole dominions, continuing to increase his train of
                    attendants, until, having made the complete circuit of the island, he returns to
                    his capital. His annual cavalcade is much complained of, on account of the
                    numerous exactions to which it gives rise.</p>
                <p>In gathering the cloves, each labourer brings to a weigh-house the quantity which
                    he gathers, where the name of the person, together with the quantity delivered,
                    is re gularly noted. But unless the cloves are thoroughly dried, the full weight
                    is not always admitted. There must be an allowance for waste, which is entirely
                    at the discretion of the receiving officer; and under this pretence the
                    unprotected inhabitants are exposed to numerous frauds. The price at which
                    cloves are received by the state is 4s. 8d. per pound; but this price is. merely
                    nominal, in consequence of large deductions being subsequently made on various
                    accounts. Of these the principal is an allowance of 20 per cent, on the weight
                    of the cloves, for the benefit of the governor and the other Servants of the
                    company; besides which, there are other deductions for the regent and chief
                    magistrates of the district, and the labourer’s wages are also paid out of the
                    price allowed by the state. The annual produce of cloves is estimated at 600,000
                    lbs., from which a deduction of one fifth or twenty per cent, amounts to 120,000
                    lbs.; and the tribute thus levied is portioned out among the residents and
                    members of the executive government, according to their respective ranks. The
                    produce of cloves is apt to vary, however, according as the season is favourable
                    or otherwise.</p>
                <p>For six years, ending in 1791, the average quantity of cloves imported into
                    Holland amounted to 597,6171bs., and were sold for a sum equal to L.155,129;
                    besides which, considerable quantities are annually sent to various parts of
                    India, Persia, Arabia, and China, the exact amount of which it is impossible to
                    ascertain. When the island was taken possession of by the British in 1796, there
                    were in store 515,940 lbs. of cloves. The quantity imported by the English East
                    India Company, after the conquest of the island by Britain, was, in the years
                    1803, 1804, 1805, respectively, 49,441, 127,866, 179,507 lbs., which were sold
                    for L.8,789, L.19,994, L.27,912.</p>
                <p>The despotism under which this fine island is oppressed, is sufficiently implied
                    in the monopoly of its produce for the state, and in the severe and sanguinary
                    laws which are found necessary to prevent contraband trade. If the government
                    were to deal fairly with its subjects, the temptation to resort to other
                    countries with this produce would be much diminished; and, in proportion to the
                    severity of the laws established against such an intercourse, we may fairly
                    estimate the extent of the fraud practised upon the inhabitants by their
                    mercantile despots. Monopoly, besides being in itself an odious abuse, is an
                    impure source from which other abuses naturally spring; and in Amboyna,
                    accordingly, we find that, as the produce of the inhabitants is engrossed by the
                    state at an undervalue, they are upon the same principle forced to purchase, at
                    prices proportionally exorbitant, whatever necessaries they may require. A
                    lucrative trade of this nature is carried on by the residents of the respective
                    provinces, as well as by the military officers at the outposts, with the
                    peasantry under their authority. They procure from the supply of stores which
                    the Dutch Company used to send annually from Batavia, such articles as the
                    natives require, particularly blue cloth, which they oblige them to purchase at
                    a price far above its value; and, in order to furnish them with the means of
                    satisfying their wants, the residents lend them money at usurious interest; so
                    that these people are reduced to the miserable alternative of either submitting
                    to the grossest oppression and fraud, or of remaining destitute of those things
                    which nature and custom unite to render necessary. The accumulated debt in which
                    the peasantry arc thus involved is a never-failing instrument of bondage and
                    oppression, as it places them entirely at the discretion of their taskmasters,
                    to whose bounty they are indebted for their miserable subsistence. An order in
                    council<pb break="no" facs="nls:193037583" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7583-0598"/> was
                    published by the Dutch government, some time before the island was conquered by
                    the British, prohibiting the residents from withholding from the peasantry, for
                    debts due to themselves, more than two thirds of the amount of their
                    spice-money. But, while the residents are necessarily vested with such extensive
                    powers, in order to enforce the system of monopoly, the peasantry are at their
                    mercy; and, under a government thus tyrannical in its principle, pretexts will
                    never be wanting for evading the force of particular laws.</p>
                <p>The maxims on which this country is governed are well explained in a code of
                    written regulations drawn up by order of the Dutch Company some years before the
                    island came into the possession of the British. This code, instead of containing
                    mild and liberal regulations for the general improvement of the community, is
                    filled with all the impolitic restrictions of avarice and despotism; the general
                    tendency of which is, by bending down and oppressing the lower orders of the
                    community, to strike at the root of national prosperity, and, finally, to
                    impoverish and degrade the country. From a view of those regulations, it appears
                    to have been the settled policy of the government of Amboyna, for 150 years
                    back, to discourage cultivation,—to check all attempts to establish
                    manufactures,—and, in short, to suppress every improvement which might enable
                    the inhabitants to supply their own wants, and might thus render them
                    independent of the monopolies established by their rulers. In this they have
                    been but too successful; and hence the people are fettered down in a state of
                    the most wretched poverty and dependence,—destitute of the common necessaries of
                    life, in consequence of their progressive advance in price; while, in the mean
                    time, the wages of labour have been forcibly depressed, or rather indeed have
                    been kept back from the labourer by fraud, he being bound to the state for a
                    variety of severe duties and services, for which he receives no remuneration. In
                    consequence of these oppressions the inhabitants are poor and indolent.
                    Agriculture has made no progress. Not more than one tenth of the island is under
                    cultivation, and it is therefore dependent on Java for supplies of cattle and
                    grain. The same causes which have discouraged the cultivation of land and the
                    rearing of cattle, have prevented the improvement of manufactures, or of the
                    mechanical arts; of which the inhabitants are so ignorant, that they do not even
                    manufacture the coarse cloth of which they make their own wearing apparel, but
                    are furnished with it from Java or Bengal, and receive it in retail from the
                    residents and men in office, at such prices as they choose to fix on it.</p>
                <p>All the natural productions of this island are in like manner neglected by the
                    policy of its rulers. It formerly produced indigo of the finest quality and
                    colour. But the growth of this valuable commodity was discouraged by the Dutch,
                    chiefly with a view of protecting the indigo trade carried on between the mother
                    country and her colonies in the West Indies, and from a jealousy, also, that the
                    natives, by acquiring wealth, might be enabled to assert their independence.
                    Sugar grows to great perfection, but its cultivation is discouraged. Coffee is
                    produced in abundance in different parts of the island; and, were the culture of
                    it sufficiently attended to, it would be equal in quality to the first Mocha
                    coffee. Wheat might be cultivated to great advantage on the beautiful heights
                    contiguous to the town of Amboyna, the soil and climate being well adapted to
                    it. Of maize there is already a great abundance; and the dry as well as mountain
                    rice is known here, but neither has been much cultivated. The bread-fruit tree
                    grows spontaneously over all the island, but is only made use of by the lowest
                    orders of the people. The cocoa-tree also grows here; but the cultivation of it
                    is almost entirely neglected. If the culture of vegetables were sufficiently
                    attended to, this island would produce a great variety, of the finest quality.
                    All sorts of roots are produced in abundance, particularly yams and sweet
                    potatoes; and the increased circulation of specie, since the island has been in
                    possession of the English, has induced the farmers to bring ample and regular
                    supplies to the market. There is also great variety of fruits, of the finest
                    quality and flavour. The general appearance of the island is extremely beautiful
                    and picturesque. Mountains everywhere covered with lofty woods in perpetual
                    foliage, and valleys clothed in verdure, interspersed with hamlets, and enriched
                    by cultivation, exhibit the most delightful variety that nature in those
                    tropical regions is capable of producing.</p>
                <p>This island is inhabited by four distinct races of people; by the Aborigines; by
                    the Amboynese properly so called, who have been found there since the earliest
                    visits of the Europeans; by the Chinese; and, lastly, by the Europeans. The
                    Aborigines have greatly decreased in numbers. They are wild and savage in their
                    habits, and are chiefly confined to the interior mountains, having no
                    intercourse with the more civilized inhabitants. They are described as being
                    cruel, ferocious, and treacherous. The native Amboynese are of an indolent and
                    effeminate character, which disposition is encouraged by the fertility of the
                    soil. The tyranny of the Dutch, by whom they are severely oppressed, and who rob
                    them of the due reward of their labour, may have conduced, along with the
                    climate, to foster these habits. The Chinese are here, as they are in all other
                    parts, an industrious and commercial people; but, from the oppressive nature of
                    the government, they are not numerous. They live in a particular street of
                    Amboyna, under the authority of a chief of their own nation. The Europeans, who
                    seem to constitute the smallest portion of the inhabitants, have rather
                    decreased in numbers. They intermarry with the natives and the other
                    inhabitants; and hence a variety of races has sprung up, distinguished by
                    different appellations, as they recede from the olive complexions of the
                    Am-boynese and approach the European white.</p>
                <p>Amboyna was first discovered by the Portuguese, who took possession of it in
                    1564. The Dutch expelled the Portuguese in 1605; and in 1615 the English made an
                    unsuccessful attempt to share the possession of the island with them. They
                    managed, however, to retain a factory till the year 1622, when differences arose
                    between the English and Dutch settlers; and in the end the latter, by the most
                    unexampled treachery, seized on the English factors, whom they accused of being
                    traitors, put them to death by the most cruel tortures, and expelled all the
                    English settlers. The Dutch having thus acquired sole possession of the island,
                    retained it till the year 1796, when it was conquered by a British force under
                    Admiral Rainier.</p>
                <p>Amboyna was captured by the British in 1796, and restored to the Dutch by the
                    peace of Amiens. It was again taken possession of in 1810, and restored to its
                    former owners by the treaty of Paris concluded in 1814. (See <hi rend="italic"

                    the island of Amboyna, is situated in the peninsula of Letymor. It is finely
                    situated at the head of a deep bay, which penetrates 21 miles inland, gradually
                    becoming narrower: it is about six miles asunder at the entrance; and near the
                    bottom, where the town is situated, it is two miles across, with deep water. On
                    t∏e south shore of the bay, and in front of Amboyna, the Europeans<pb break="no"

                    fortification of Victoria, which is an irregular hexagon, with a ditch and
                    covered way on the land side, and a horn-work towards the sea. Being commanded,
                    however, by two ranges of heights, at the distance of from 700 to 1200 yards, it
                    could make no serious resistance to an invading force. The town of Am-boyna is
                    extremely clean, and both neatly and regularly built in the form of an oblong
                    square. The streets, which are wide and improved, intersect each other at right
                    angles. They consist, for the most part, of houses of only one story,
                    constructed of wood, and covered with palm leaves laced together, which is the
                    mode of building adopted, from the dread of earthquakes. They are provided with
                    frames of matted cane in place of glass windows, for the sake of coolness as
                    well as of economy; and in general they have small gardens behind them, with a
                    well of good water, which is here procured in abundance, either by digging, or
                    from the rivulets intersecting the town, which swell into torrents during the
                    rainy season. The esplanade, which reaches from the covert-way of the fort to
                    the town, a space of 250 yards, is terminated by a range of handsome
                    dwelling-houses, with a double row of nutmeg-trees in front of them. Here the
                    principal European inhabitants reside; and the west part of the town is the
                    appointed residence of the Chinese. There are two well-built churches, one for
                    Europeans, the other for the Malay Christians, in which service is performed in
                    the Malay language. All the other public buildings are in the fort, except the
                    town-house, which fronts the esplanade, and is a neat building of two stories.
                    An earth quake took place in 1755, which greatly damaged the two churches, one
                    of which it was necessary to rebuild. The heat is generally from 80° to 82°, and
                    the lowest point of the thermometer is 72°. Long. 128. 15. E. Lat 3. 40. S. <hi
