                <p><label type="entry">AJAX</label>, the son of Oileus, was one of the principal
                    generals who went to the siege of Troy. He ravished Cassandra, the daughter of
                    Priam, even in the temple of Minerva, where she thought to have found sanctuary.
                    It is said he made a serpent of 15 feet long so familiar with him, that it ate
                    at his table, and followed him like a dog. The Locrians had a singular
                    veneration for his memory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ajax,</hi> the son of Telamon, was, next to Achilles, the
                    most valiant general among the Greeks at the siege of Troy. He commanded the
                    troops of Salamis, and performed many great actions, of which we have an account
                    in the Iliad, in <hi rend="italic">Dictys</hi><hi rend="italic">Cretensis,</hi>
                    and in the 23d book of Ovid’s Metamorphoses. He was so enraged that the arms of
                    Achilles were adjudged to Ulysses, that he immediately became mad. The Greeks
                    paid great honour to him after his death, and erected a magnificent monument to
                    his memory, upon the promontory of Rhetium.</p>

                    kind of dance, in use among the Grecians; intended to represent the madness of

                    preference in his contest for Achilles’s arms. Lucian, in his treatise of
