                    situated in N. lat. 50. 35. E. long. 2. 10. famous on account of the victory
                    obtained by Henry V. of England over the French.</p>
                <p>On the morning of Friday the memorable 25th of October, A. D. 1415, the day of
                    Crispin and Crispianus, the English and French armies were ranged in order of
                    battle, each in three lines, with bodies of cavalry on each wing. The constable
                    D’Albert, who commanded the French army, fell into the snare that was laid for
                    him, by drawing up his army in the narrow plain between the two woods. This
                    deprived him, in a great measure, of the advantage he should have derived from
                    the prodigious superiority of his numbers; obliged him to make his lines
                    unnecessarily deep, about 30 men in file; to crowd his troops, particularly his
                    cavalry, so close together, that they could hardly move or use their arms; and,
                    in a word, was the chief cause of all the disasters that followed. The French,
                    it is said, had a considerable number of cannon of different sizes in the field;
                    but we do not hear that they did any execution, probably for want of room. The
                    first line of the French army, which consisted of 8000 men-at-arms on foot,
                    mixed with 4000 archers, with 500 men-at-arms mounted on each wing, was
                    commanded by the constable D’Albert, the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, and many
                    other nobles; the dukes of Alençon, Brabant, and Bar, &amp;c. conducted the
                    second line; and the earls of Marie, Damartine, Fauconberg, &amp;c. were at the
                    head of the third line. The king of England employed various arts to supply his
                    defect of numbers. He placed 200 of his best archers in ambush, in a low meadow,
                    on the flank of the first line of the French. His own first line consisted
                    wholly of archers, four in file; each of whom, besides his bow and arrows, had a
                    battle-axe, a sword, and a stake pointed with iron at both ends, which he fixed
                    before him in the ground, the point inclining outwards, to protect him - from
                    cavalry. This was a new invention, and had a happy effect. That he might not be
                    encumbered, he dismissed all his prisoners on their word of honour to surrender
                    themselves at Calais if he obtained the victory, and lodged all his baggage in
                    the village of Agincourt, in his rear, under a slender guard. The command of the
                    first line was, at his earnest request, committed to Edward duke of York,
                    assisted by the lords Beaumont, Willoughby, and Fanhope; the second was
                    conducted by the king, with his youngest brother Humphrey duke of Gloucester,
                    the earls of Oxford, Marshal, and Suffolk; and the third was led by the duke of
                    Exeter, the king’s uncle. The lines being formed, the king, in shining armour,
                    with a crown of gold adorned with precious stones on his helmet, mounted on a
                    fine white horse, rode along them, and addressed each corps with a cheerful
                    countenance and animating speeches. To inflame their resentment against their
                    enemies, he told them that the French hail determined to cut off three fingers
                    of the right hand of every prisoner; and to rouse their love of honour, he
                    declared, that every soldier in that army who behaved well should from
                    henceforth be deemed a gentleman, and entitled to bear coat armour.</p>
                <p>When the two armies were drawn up in this manner, they stood a considerable time
                    gazing at one another in solemn silence. But the king, dreading that the French
                    would discover the danger of their situation, and decline a battle, commanded
                    the charge to be sounded, about ten o’clock in the forenoon. At that instant the
                    first line of the English kneeled down and kissed the ground; and then starting
                    up, discharged a flight of arrows, which did great execution among the crowded
                    ranks of the French. Immediately after, upon a signal being given, the archers
                    in ambush arose, and discharged their arrows on the flank of the French line,
                    and threw it into some disorder. The battle now became general, and raged with
                    uncommon fury. The English archers, having expended all their arrows, threw away
                    their bows, and rushing forward, made dreadful havock with their swords and
                    battle-axes. The first line of the enemy was by these means defeated, its
                    leaders being either killed or taken prisoners. The second line, commanded by
                    the duke D’Alençon (who had made a vow either to kill or take the king of
                    England, or to perish in the attempt), now advanced to the charge, and was
                    encountered by the second line of the English, conducted by the king. This
                    conflict was more close and furious than the former. The duke of Gloucester,
                    wounded and unhorsed, was protected by his royal brother till he was carried off
                    the field. The duke D’Alençon forced his way to the king, and assaulted him with
                    great fury; but that prince brought him to the ground, where he was instantly
                    dispatched. Discouraged by this disaster, the second line made no more
                    resistance, and the third fled without striking a blow; yielding a complete and
                    glorious victory to the English, after a violent struggle of three hours’
                    duration.</p>
