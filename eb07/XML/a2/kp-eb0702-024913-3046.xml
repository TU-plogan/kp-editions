                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">AGRA</label>, a province of Hindostan, chiefly situated
                    between the 25th and 28th degrees of N. lat. On the north it is bounded by the
                    province of Delhi, on the south by that of Malwah, on the east by the provinces
                    of Oude and Allahabad, and on the west by that of Ajmeer. It is estimated to be
                    250 miles in length, and in average breadth to be 180. The following are the
                    principal geographical and political divisions:—1. Agra district; 2. the Doab;
                    3. the district of Etaweh; 4. the Furruckabad district; 5. Cal-pee, Gohud, and
                    Gualior; 6. the Bhurtpoor territories; 7. Alvar or Machery; 8. the Alighur
                    district.</p>
                <p>This province has an unequal surface. To the north-east of the Jumna the country
                    is flat and open, and rather bare of trees; but to the south of the Chumbul, and
                    also towards the western frontier, it rises into hills, and is interspersed with
                    jungle. Owing to the elevation of the ground, it has for the greater part of the
                    year a temperate climate. In summer, while the hot winds prevail, it is
                    intensely hot, and the climate is unhealthful, especially among the hills. But
                    these winds do not continue for any length of time; and in the winter months it
                    is actually cold, especially during the night. The province is indifferently
                    watered. The chief rivers are the Jumna, the Chumbul, and the Ganges, besides
                    other streams of inferior note. Except in the vicinity of the large rivers,
                    water is scarce for the purposes of irrigation. Rice, which requires an abundant
                    supply of moisture, is not cultivated. The soil is particularly adapted to the
                    cultivation of indigo, cotton, and sugar, the production of which is annually
                    increasing in the country under the jurisdiction of the British: in that which
                    is still subject to the native chiefs, agriculture is in a backward state. There
                    are no remarkable mineral productions in the province of Agra. The animals
                    differ in no respect from those found in other parts of Hindostan; and the breed
                    of horses is much esteemed. The principal article manufactured is coarse cotton
                    cloth; but no great quantity is exported. The most fertile part of the province
                    is the Doab, or the territory included between the Ganges and the Jumna, which
                    exports indigo, sugar, and cotton. The country to the north-west of Agra, which
                    is under the dominion of the native chiefs, being scantily supplied with water,
                    is of a very inferior quality, and comparatively unproductive. This province is
                    not nearly so populous as Bengal, Jaupore, and the more flourishing parts of the
                    British territory. It does not contain above six millions of inhabitants, of
                    whom the greater proportion live under the British jurisdiction; the remainder
                    under Scindia and others of the native princes. The chief towns, besides Agra,
                    the capital, are Alvar or Aloor, the capital of a native rajah; Bhurtpoor, one
                    of the strongest fortresses in India, which the British carried by storm in
                    1826; Deeg, another strong fortress; Mathura, Kanoje, Etaweh, Gualior, Gohud,
                    Calpee, Narwar, and Furruckabad. The natives are in general a robust and
                    handsome race of people, and consist of a mixture of Hindoos and Mahometans. The
                    Hindoo religion and language are predominant, although the country has been
                    subject to the Mahometans since the thirteenth century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Agra,</hi> the capital of the preceding province, is
                    situated on the south-west side of the Jumna, from the banks of which it extends
                    upward in a vast semicircle. It is a large, old, and ruinous city, with little
                    to attract attention beyond that picturesque confusion of houses, balconies, and
                    projecting roofs, common to all Indian towns. The houses consist of several
                    stories, and the streets are so narrow as scarcely to admit a palanquin. The
                    greater part of this once flourishing city is now a heap of ruins, and
                    uninhabited. It is still, however, estimated to contain 60,000 inhabitants; and
                    as its commerce improves, which it is likely to do, from the facilities which it
                    affords to the trade of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033059"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3059-0250"/>western Hindostan, its population is likely to
                    increase also. Since 1818, indeed, in consequence of the tranquillity of the
                    neighbouring province of Rajpootana or Ajmeer, the produce of the customs has
                    continued progressively to increase. It has a fort, which is very large and
                    ancient, and is surrounded with high walls and towers of red stone, of the
                    hardness and colour of jasper, which command some noble views of the city, its
                    neighbourhood, and the windings of the Jumna. The fort has a ditch of great
                    depth, and a double rampart, the inner one being of an enormous height, with
                    bastions at regular distances. Agra is famed for some beautiful edifices, the
                    most remarkable of which is the Jagemahal, a tomb erected by the emperor Shah
                    Jehan, to the memory of Begum Novr-jehan, his beloved wife. Bishop Heber
                    mentions, that after all he had heard of this celebrated mausoleum, its beauty
                    rather exceeded than fell short of his expectations. It is of white marble, and
                    is placed on an elevated terrace of white and yellow marble, with four tall
                    minarets of the same material rising at each of its angles. The interior,
                    containing a central hall, in which are the tombs of the emperor and his wife,
                    is remarkable for its exquisite finish; the pavement being laid with alternate
                    squares of marble, and the walls, screens, and tombs, crowned with flowers and
                    inscriptions executed in beautiful Mosaic of cornelian, lapis lazuli, and
                    jasper. The general effect of the whole is solemn and impressive rather than
                    gaudy. There is a tomb erected to another of the emperors, now used as a court
                    of justice, which is a splendid edifice. Agra contains, besides, a beautiful
                    mosque of white marble, carved with exquisite simplicity and elegance, and the
                    palace, built by Acbar chiefly of the same material, and now used as warehouses,
                    offices, and lodging-rooms for the garrison. At Secundra, a ruinous village
                    about six miles from Agra, is the magnificent tomb of the emperor Acbar, which,
                    Bishop Heber remarks, is the most splendid building in its way that he had seen
                    in India.</p>
                <p>Agra was greatly enlarged and embellished by Acbar, who made it his capital. The
                    city, which was under the rule of Scindia, surrendered to the British army under
                    Lord Lake in 1803. It was soon after made the scat of the civil establishment
                    for the collection of the revenue and the administration of justice. The
                    fortifications have been lately strengthened and improved. 137 miles travelling
