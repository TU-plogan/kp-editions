                <p><label type="entry">ALPHONSO I</label>. king of Portugal, son of Henry of
                    Burgundy, count of Portugal, grandson of Don Alonso, king of Leon and Castile,
                    who, as the dowry of his wife Theresa, received part of the kingdom of Portugal.
                    One Egas Munitz had the charge of his education from his father, the duties of
                    which he executed with fidelity and success. In the year 1112 his father died,
                    leaving him a boy only three years of age, when the reins of government and the
                    care of the infant son fell to his mother Theresa. At the age of 18 he assumed
                    the sovereign authority by the advice of the nobles of Portugal, who were highly
                    offended at the growing partiality of his mother for Don Ferdinand Perez, count
                    of Trastemara; for it was suspected that she intended to marry him. But Theresa
                    was little disposed to resign the reins of government. Her party raised an army,
                    which took the field to oppose the nobility who supported Alphonso; but her
                    adherents were defeated, herself taken prisoner, and kept in confinement during
                    the remainder of her life. Not long after his accession to the throne, his
                    abilities both to govern and to conquer received a severe trial, in several
                    arduous enterprises, as well against the king of Leon and Castile, as against
                    the Moorish princes, who then possessed great part of Spain and Portugal. The
                    Moorish emperor in Barbary having sent a strong reinforcement to the princes,
                    they were enabled to take the field with an army far superior to that of
                    Alphonso; yet he valiantly met them in the plains of Ourique, and totally
                    defeated their forces. Thus Providence conferred such a signal favour on the
                    Christian arms as procured a residence for Christianity in those parts. The
                    ambitious king of Leon and Castile assumed the title of emperor of the
                    Spaniards, and entered Portugal to waste and destroy; but after the emperor had
                    received a temporary check, the matter was accommodated, and he withdrew his
                    army. In consequence of the victory obtained on the plains of Ourique, Alphonso
                    was instantly proclaimed king; but the form and constitution of the monarchy
                    were not settled until the nobility, prelates, and commons had assembled at
                    Lamago for that purpose in the year 1145. The conquest of Santarem preceded this
                    event, and was sanctioned by the unanimous concurrence of the states. The honour
                    of crowning the king was conferred upon the archbishop of Braga; and it was
                    legally provided that the crown should descend with an uninterrupted succession
                    to the heirs male of Alphonso. The prelates and nobility, with the concurrence
                    of the people, instituted a code of laws, consisting of 18 statutes, for the
                    government of the kingdom. It being proposed whether it was their pleasure that
                    the king should go to Leon and do homage to that prince or to any other, every
                    man, drawing his sword, exclaimed, “We are free, and our king is free, and we
                    owe our liberty to our courage; and if he shall at any time submit to such an
                    act, he deserves death, and shall not either reign over us or among us.” The
                    year after his coronation he was married to Matilda, daughter of Amadeus, count
                    of Maurienne and Savoy; and he recovered Lisbon from the hands of the Moors in
                    the year 1147. A multitude of adventurers being assembled at the mouth of the
                    Tagus in their progress to the Holy Land, greatly assisted him in this conquest.
                    After having added six other provinces to his dominions, he wisely began with
                    industrious activity to regulate the affairs of his kingdom. In all his great
                    and benevolent designs he was vigorously seconded by Matilda, a princess equally
                    celebrated for her great beauty, mental vigour, and singular piety. He was no
                    less provident in peopling and improving, than enterprising in acquiring
                    territories. The conjugal felicity of this prince and princess was greatly
                    enhanced by a numerous offspring, which enabled him, by great alliances, to
                    strengthen his interests. His second daughter was married to Don Ferdinand, king
                    of Leon, who, notwithstanding this alliance, ungenerously made war on his
                    father-in-law, and took him prisoner in the field of battle; but released him,
                    on the humiliating condition of coming in person to do homage for his dominions
                    at Leon. In the latter part of his reign, his son Don Sancho, who inherited all
                    his father’s military talents, took the lead on several occasions; and in the
                    year 1180, Joseph, king of Morocco, and emperor of the Almohedes, advancing with
                    an army as far as Santarem, he there gained a glorious victory over him. Such
                    was the consternation of the infidels, in consequence of this defeat, that they
                    left the Portuguese at liberty to improve the interior part of the country, and
                    to fortify their frontiers during the whole of next year. Worn out with care and
                    intense application, Alphonso retired to Coimbra for repose, where, after a
                    reign of 57 years, and in the 76th year of his, age, he died. In the church of
                    the holy cross at Coimbra his remains were deposited with great funeral
                    solemnity. He was no less than seven feet high; and his gigantic size and
                    martial ardour have given occasion to many absurd and incredible stories
                    concerning his military achievements, so that, in the annals of chivalry, as
                    well as in the records of martial exertions, he sustains a very high rank.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonso</hi> II. distinguished by the surname of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fat,</hi> was the third king of Portugal, and succeeded his
                    father, at the age of 27 years, in 1212. He commenced his reign with two very
                    popular acts. The one was, sending a body of infantry to the assistance of the
                    king of Castile, who fought with uncommon bravery in the renowned battle of
                    Navas de Tolosa; the other was, his donation of the castle of Avis to the
                    knights of that order, when the grand-master removed from Evora, and took up his
                    habitation in that castle. His father having discovered that he disliked his
                    brothers and sisters, endeavoured to secure them from the effects of his
                    resentment, by conferring upon them large sums of money and jewels, and some of
                    the best parts of the kingdom. After the death of his father, Alphonso
                    strenuously laboured to convince them that it was not in the power of his father
                    to separate or give away any part of his dominions; but all his urgent eloquence
                    proving unsuccessful, he had recourse to arms. The two princesses, his sisters,
                    who had received by the grant of their father very extensive and valuable
                    property, upon being attacked by their brother, implored the interference of the
                    pope, and also applied to the king of Leon to grant his protection, so that they
                    made a very vigorous defence. The pope granted the request of the young
                    princesses, and threatened to excommunicate Alphonso; and from Galicia Don
                    Ferdinand entered the dominions of Portugal to ravage and destroy; but the king
                    prepared to defend himself against the arms of the king of Leon, and, by
                    specious pretences, to evade the excommunication of the pope.</p>
                <p>Authors are not agreed with respect to the success of this war, but it is
                    generally supposed that, by the interference of these two powerful persons, the
                    domestic affairs of that house were restored to a certain degree °Ç <hi
                    rend="superscript"> tra</hi>!î* quillity. However, the departure of the infant
                    Don Ferdinand to the court of Castile, and of Don Pedro to another place,
                    strongly indicate that the reconciliation was far <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193036998" xml:id="kp-eb0702-6998-0553"/>from being perfect. The
                    conduct of the king, however, produced much diversity of opinion among the
                    common people of Portugal. Some were induced, by his arguments, to conclude that
                    it was not in the power of Don Sancho, the late king, to dismember his kingdom;
                    and others very properly suspected the kindness of a prince: to his people, who
                    displayed such uncommon and such unjustifiable hatred to his own relations; at
                    the same time, those nobles whom the father had solemnly sworn to carry his will
                    into execution, were induced, by a regard for the sacred nature of their oaths,
                    to act against the reigning •prince. <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi></p>
                <p>The displeasure of the pope, however, was not to be endured. The mind of Alphonso
                    seemed indeed to be of that quality which little regarded the displeasure or .
                    thunders of his holiness; but the effects of his threaten- ings were very
                    different upon the public mind, consequently the king was constrained to seek
                    the favour of the pope, that he might retain the obedience of his subjects. The
                    king therefore sent deputies to Rome, who argued, that the crown his father wore
                    was the purchase of the blood and valour of the Portuguese nation, and therefore
                    not at his disposal; that it was a dangerous precedent, and obviously tended to
                    subvert the sovereignty of /state; that the disuniting of the kingdom would tend
                    to promote the cause of the infidels; and, in fine, that his disputes with his
                    sisters had no connection with ecclesiastical matters. The pope, however, was as
                    well qualified •to discern the nature of these specious arguments as the prince
                    was qualified to urge them, consequently he remained unmoved; and Alphonso, in
                    order to have the sentence of excommunication which had been pronounced upon him
                    removed, was reluctantly induced to be reconciled to his sisters. His holiness,
                    informed of the reconciliation, with great ceremony revoked his curse and
                    .excommunication from the king and his subjects.</p>
                <p>But the reign of this prince was destined to troubles; for no sooner was this
                    domestic broil terminated than the Moors rushed into the plain country in such
                    prodigious numbers, that the king found it very difficult to repel them, or to
                    drive them back to their own country. A favourable occurrence, however, enabled
                    him to complete his object, by the taking of a fortress seated on a rock which
                    was deemed impregnable, in the following manner. The Germans and Flemings had
                    equipped an immense fleet destined for the Holy Land, consisting of 300 sail,
                    with a numerous army on board. In consequence of tempestuous weather,
                    their-fleet was so disabled that they were forced to put into the harbour of
                    Lisbon to refit, just at the time when Alphonso was preparing an army to attack
                    the Moors. The king instantly sent some of the most respectable men of his court
                    to solicit their aid against -the Moors, alleging, that it was perfectly
                    consistent with their vows to fight against the Moors in Portugal, as well as in
                    the Holy Land. William earl of Holland and many other generals were convinced ’
                    by this argument, and cheerfully engaged to join him against the infidels; but
                    about a third part of·the fleet refused to join, and proceeded on their voyage.
                    It happened, however, that they were driven by a violent storm into Italy, where
                    they wintered. The greater part ≈ of the nobility and gentry landed under the
                    conduct of William earl of Holland; and it was resolved that they should proceed
                    by sea, and block up Alcaçar-do-Sal, the fortress already mentioned, while the
                    army of Alphonso, reinforced by a considerable number, should march by land; and
                    thus attack the place both by land and sea at once. The Moors, convinced of me
                    importance of this place, brought an army into the field consisting of 50,000
                    men; but the Christians raised the siege, gave them battle, and routed them with
                    great slaughter; and some of the chiefs of the Moors fell in the field. The
                    fortress surrendered on the 21st of October 1217, and was conferred upon the
                    order of St James; but notwithstanding very urgent entreaties, the pope would
                    not permit the army to winter in Portugal. He was desirous of having these
                    troops and their general removed to a greater distance. The writers of that
                    nation affirm that the soldiers experienced supernatural aid in this battle, and
                    that the banner of the cross was actually displayed by angels.</p>
                <p>But civil animosity succeeded to infidel war. The archbishop of Braga was highly
                    offended that the clergy were forced to pay money and furnish troops to carry on
                    the war against the infidels; and the people severely complained of the
                    strictness of the laws. To chastise the rebellious clergy, the king seized upon
                    the revenues of the bishop, and forced him to fly from his dominions. Enraged at
                    this impious conduct, the pope excommunicated the king, and laid his kingdom
                    under an interdict. The natural consequence was, that all things were thrown
                    into confusion, and consternation and perplexity universally prevailed; so that
                    Alphonso was obliged to consult measures to quell the rising discontent. It
                    happened, however, that in the midst of these negotiations he was removed by
                    death, and not only died under the papal malediction, but left his kingdom under
                    the same curse. He was interred without royal honours, in the conventual church
                    of Alcobaça.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonso</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Don,</hi> king of
                    Portugal, succeeded his brother Don Sancho II. in the year 1248. In the course
                    of a war with the Moors, in which he engaged at the be- ∙ginning of his reign,
                    he considerably extended the Portuguese dominions. He took possession of the
                    city of Faro, the capital of the Moorish kingdom, in the province of Algarve.
                    Loulé, another Moorish town, which was carried by storm, also fell into his
                    hands. His power Was thus ‘extended abroad by the success of his arms, and the
                    administration of his affairs at home became prosperous and popular by his
                    wisdom and prudence. But the tranquillity and prosperity of the kingdom were
                    somewhat disturbed by an interdict which it was put under by Pope Alexander IV.,
                    whose displeasure he had incurred by marrying Donna Beatrix, the natural
                    daughter of Don Alonso the Wise, king of Castile, while his first wife was
                    living. In 1262, when his first queen died, the interdict was removed by Pope
                    Urban, a dispensation was granted, and the children of Donna Beatrix were
                    legitimated. Hitherto frequent disputes had occurred between the kings of
                    Portugal and Castile relating to the boundaries of the two kingdoms. To
                    terminate all differences on this subject, and to prevent them in future,
                    commissioners were appointed to define and settle the limits of their respective
                    dominions; and these were agreed to and acknowledged by a solemn deed.</p>
                <p>Encouraged by the prosperity of his kingdom, and by the success which had
                    attended his enterprises, Alphonso made an attempt to extend the influence of
                    the crown, by obliging the clergy to contribute to the welfare of the state. But
                    this measure, as might have been expected, was not quietly submitted to. It
                    occasioned the revival of old disputes, the pope interfered, and in 1268 the
                    kingdom was again laid under an interdict. Alphonso succeeded, by the wisdom of
                    his negotiations, in obtaining from Castile an exemption from all claims upon
                    the crown of Portugal, and in procuring an acknowledgement that its monarchs
                    were entirely relieved from the performance of every kind∙of homage. He died in
                    1279, in the 69th year of his age, and in the 31st of his reign. Before <pb

                    rend="italic">Erave,</hi> was the son of King Denis. Instigated, it is said, by
                    the queen dowager of Castile, and moved with jealousy against his natural
                    brother Alphonso Sanchez, he revolted against his father, and commenced a civil
                    war. In this unnatural and base war he was justly unsuccessful; but although he
                    was reduced to subjection, yet his haughty and ungovernable temper broke out in
                    many occurrences, until he succeeded his father in 1324. He commenced his reign
                    with devising plans for the security of his family in the government, and the
                    good of the kingdom: he likewise manifested a strong benevolence of heart, in
                    his affection for his consort Queen Beatrix, and his dutiful conduct towards his
                    mother. Not long after, he engaged in war with Alonzo XI. king of Castile,
                    which, after several severe struggles, with various success on both sides,
                    terminated in an alliance, and in effectual assistance against the Moors. The
                    artful and cruel part which he acted towards Donna Agnes de Castro, the mistress
                    and concealed wife of his son, reflected the greatest disgrace upon his
                    character. It is proper, however, to remark, that he was instigated to the
                    murder of this princess by his courtiers. It was not therefore to be wondered at
                    if his son was induced by this act to rise up in open rebellion against him; but
                    the arms of his father were too formidable; and after his submission his father
                    treated him with particular marks of attention. Instructed by the growing
                    infirmities of years, he saw the termination of his reign and life approaching.
                    He began to compensate for his past errors .and faults by redressing grievances,
                    by restraining immorality through the establishment of pious laws, by dictating
                    salutary maxims for the government of the state, by removing those from the
                    seats of power who were the most likely to become the objects of resentment
                    after his death: he thus laboured to efface from the remembrance of his son the
                    insult which he had received. While concerting these conciliatory measures, he
                    died in May 1357, in the 32d year of his reign, and the 67th of his age. In
                    .many respects he deserves the character of a great man and a great king,—brave
                    and fortunate in war, but artful and indirect in his political measures,
                    attached to his subjects, strict in the administration of justice, attentive to
                    the public welfare, and assiduous in encouraging industry and enriching his
                    people.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonso</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Eon,</hi> king of
                    Portugal, was born in 1432, and on account of his heroic deeds obtained the
                    surname .of the <hi rend="italic">African.</hi> At the age of six years he
                    succeeded his father King Edward. The administration of the affairs of the
                    kingdom during his minority was intrusted to his uncle Don Pedro, who, although
                    his public conduct met with general approbation, was persecuted as a traitor at
                    .the expiration of his regency, and, with several persons who were attached to
                    his interest, and involved in his misfortunes, was put to death. The young king
                    had married the daughter of the regent; but even his influence, which was
                    overpowered by the regent’s enemies, could not save him from persecution.
                    Afterwards indeed he did justice to his memory, and discovered an unusual mark
                    of respect and attachment to his queen, by abstaining from all connection with
                    the sex after her death, which happened in 1455, and, it has been supposed, was
                    occasioned by poison, administered by the enemies of her father.</p>
                <p>Alphonso aspired to the acquisition of military glory. In the year 1458 he made
                    great preparations to attack the Moors in Barbary. He assembled an army of
                    20,000 men, and equipped a fleet of 200 sail. He first directed his arms against
                    Alcazar, which soon fell into his hands; and, to maintain the footing which he
                    had gained, he furnished this place with a strong garrison. For twelve years he
                    prosecuted the war in Barbary with various success, in that time reduced Arzilla
                    and Tangier, and in 1470 returned to Portugal loaded with honours. It was then
                    that he obtained the surname of <hi rend="italic">African,</hi> and to the
                    titles which he derived from his ancestors, added that of <hi rend="italic">lord
                    of the coasts of both seas;</hi> and, with a view to perpetuate the memory of
                    these exploits and conquests, he caused a representation of them to be wrought
                    in tapestry, a monument surely constructed of very frail materials, but not less
                    durable than many which have been erected by ambition and vanity. During the war
                    in Africa, a military order denominated <hi rend="italic">the knights of the
                    sword</hi> was founded.</p>
                <p>Alphonso was less successful in supporting the claim of his niece Donna Joanna to
                    the crown of Castile against Ferdinand and Isabella. Finding his own resources
                    unequal to the contest in which he was engaged, he took a journey to France to
                    solicit the aid of Louis XI. But his solicitations proved fruitless; and the
                    mortification which he experienced from this faithless monarch filled him with
                    melancholy, and induced him to resign his crown for the purpose of making a
                    pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The administration of affairs during his absence
                    was committed to the hands of his son Don Juan, who governed the kingdom with
                    great ability. When the .king returned he was joyfully received by the prince,
                    and reinstated in his authority. But the mind of Alphonsohad lost its wonted
                    vigour, and was unfit to resume the arduous duties of government. Oppressed
                    still with a deep melancholy, he determined at length to withdraw from the cares
                    of a kingdom, and to end his days in the repose and quiet of a monastery. But,
                    on his journey to the place of his retirement, he was seized with the plague at
                    Cintra, where he died in 1481, in the 43d year of his reign, and the 49th of his
                    age. The moderation, the prudence and wisdom, which this prince exhibited in his
                    public conduct, were not more powerful in conciliating the love and veneration
                    of his subjects, and of all good men, than were the amiable virtues of his
                    private character. He was distinguished for his affability and condescension,
                    his benignity and bounty, and especially for his unbounded charity. In the
                    exercise of this latter virtue he was honoured with the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">redeemer of the captives,</hi> in consequence of his having
                    procured the freedom of many prisoners, whose ransom he cheerfully paid. Nor was
                    he less eminent for his chastity and temperance, his attachment to letters, and
                    his love and encouragement of learning. The first library in the palace of the
                    kings of Portugal was founded in his time. He established and vindicated,
                    against the pretensions and hostile attempts of the Spaniards, a very profitable
                    trade on the coast of Guinea, which country was discovered during his reign,
                    under the auspices of his uncle Don Henry, a celebrated character of that
                    age.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonso</hi> VI. <hi rend="italic">Eon Enriquez,</hi> king
                    of Portugal, ascended the throne when only a child of thirteen years of age. It
                    is not easy to conceive a kingdom in a more perilous situation than this at the
                    death of Don John. The young king was remarkable for weakness of body and
                    imbecility of mind; the regency in the hands of a woman, and that woman a
                    Castilian; the nation involved in war, and this respecting the title to the
                    crown; many of the nobility engaged in feuds and contentions with each other,
                    and some of them secretly disaffected to the reigning family; so that the queen
                    scarcely knew to whom she could trust, or by whom she was to be obeyed. A very
                    indecent joy was manifested by the people on the king’s death, as if his death
                    was the dissolution of government; but the great abilities of the queen, and the
                    vigorous measures<pb break="no" facs="nls:193037024"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-7024-0555"/> which she adopted, soon changed the face of
                    affairs. For her own safety, and the prosperity of the kingdom, she appointed
                    Don Francisco de Faro, count of Odemira, of the house of Braganza, governor to
                    the king, and one of her principal ministers of state; and she made choice of
                    Don Antonio de Meneses, count de Castenhedã, to be his coadjutor. The former was
                    a person in high repute among the nobility, in great favour with the people,
                    entirely devoted to the interests of the queen, possessed of a large estate, and
                    far advanced in years; the latter was also an aged man of great talents, and
                    equally capable to preside in the cabinet and to command in the field. As might
                    naturally be expected, these men sometimes differed in opinion; but this
                    difference never hurt the cause of the queen. Seconded, protected, and
                    counselled by such able men, the nation began to feel the effects of the queen’s
                    firmness and superior talents.</p>
                <p>The first important exertion of the queen was, to send express orders to the
                    count de San Lorenzo, who commanded on the frontiers, to act offensively; but
                    the measure, though prudent in itself, was not attended with the desired
                    success. About this time, however, the duke de St Germain, an Italian officer in
                    the service of Spain, entered Portugal, and besieged and took Olivenza and the
                    castle of Moran. In consequence of this, the general was dismissed, and his
                    place was filled by Juan Mendez Vascon-celles, a man in great favour with the
                    troops, and universally popular. He engaged to act also upon the offensive; but
                    being unsuccessful, he was only saved from punishment by his simple and candid
                    defence, in which he says, “that he had undertaken the siege in obedience to the
                    order of the queen, and for the honour of the nation; and that he had raised it
                    without orders, for the preservation of the army; that he knew the hazard he ran
                    when he did it, but that it gave him pleasure to think, that at the hazard, or
                    even the loss, of his reputation and life, the troops of Portugal had been
                    saved.” He was declared innocent, and worthy of the queen’s favour, by the
                    council of war who presided. Don Sancho Manuel, who commanded in Elvas, and
                    defended it with equal bravery and conduct, showed himself to be an officer of
                    considerable judgment, by his hazarding nothing more when he had performed his
                    service, upon which the very being of the state depended; but it was the count
                    de Castanheda who raised that siege, and forced the army of Spain in their
                    lines. After some other political measures, the queen regent finished in a
                    manner her administration with the marriage of her only daughter, the princess
                    Catharine, once intended for Louis XIV., with Charles II. king of Great Britain,
                    one of the most fortunate events that ever happened for Portugal, since it
                    immediately procured them the protection of the English fleets, besides adding
                    much reputation to their affairs throughout Europe; which was the reason that
                    the Spanish court opposed it with so much heat, or rather passion. By the
                    vigorous exertions and fortunate victories of Montesclaros, the war was soon
                    terminated to the honour of Portugal. The sixth and last victory in the course
                    of 28 years was obtained by the marquis de Marialva, which was chiefly owing to
                    unforeseen accidents, to the determined couvage of foreign troops, and to the
                    great abilities of Schomberg. This victory determined the fate of the kingdom,
                    though not of the sovereign; and it was easy to be seen by the more intelligent
                    people in Portugal, that the king Would sooner or later be deposed.</p>
                <p>. Alphonso being struck with the palsy while a child, it became necessary to
                    treat him with indulgence, on account of his weak state of health; consequently,
                    as he rose to maturity, his want of parts, and the defects in his education,
                    Were very perceptible. It is alleged that a greater affection was shown by the
                    queen his mother to the infant Don Pedro, and that she endeavoured, at the time
                    of their father’s decease, to insinuate into the nobles an idea of preferring
                    him; but they universally declined to make a breach in the succession, declaring
                    it was difficult to make an estimate of the powers of a king who was then only a
                    child. The queen yielded, and endeavoured by every proper means to make him
                    worthy of a crown, Which, by birth, he was entitled to wear. The count de
                    Odemira, who was charged with his education, found it a very difficult task to
                    manage the young prince, who, forgetful of his birth and destination, was prone
                    only to those amusements which the youth of his age were accustomed to. His
                    guardian and preceptor struggled with this disposition, and even ventured to
                    take some pretty Severe measures; but, to his great mortification, it proved
                    entirely abortive. A variety of facts that might be mentioned are sufficient
                    evidence that his natural dispositions were weak, wild, refractory, and
                    unteachable; and that although he was born to reign, yet he was destitute of the
                    qualities absolutely necessary in a prince. The direful consequences of this
                    having been for some time experienced by the nation, the nobles were at last
                    driven to the resolution of deposing the king, and exalting Don Pedro to the
                    regency. In the morning of the next day after the determination, the marquis de
                    Caseaes, at the head of the council, went to the palace to propose the
                    resignation to the king. The king was in bed and fast asleep: the marquis
                    ordered him to be awakened, and knocked violently at the door for that purpose;
                    and when he obtained admission, he is said to have upbraided him in very coarse
                    terms for his laziness and inattention to public affairs at so critical a
                    conjuncture; adding, that since he must be sensible of his want of abilities to
                    govern a kingdom, the wisest method he could adopt was, to resign it in favour
                    of his brother. The king absolutely refused to consent; but not long after, Don
                    Pedro coming to the palace, ordered him to be confined in his apartment, where
                    one of his favourites persuaded him, in the hope of being set at liberty, to
                    make a short renunciation of the crown in favour of his brother Don Pedro and
                    his lawful issue, reserving the house of Braganza and its dependencies, together
                    with 100,000 crowns out of the revenue of the crown. Nor was this deemed
                    sufficient; for a paper was presented to him, making him avow, that for want of
                    consummation his marriage was null. This he at first declined; but, by the
                    advice of some divines, he was prevailed on to subscribe the deed. The
                    unfortunate Don Alphonso died, after he had been a prisoner near fifteen years,
                    when he had borne the title of king almost twenty-seven, and had lived about
                    forty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonso</hi> III., surnamed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Great,</hi> king of Asturias, was born in 847, and succeeded his father Ordogno
                    in 865. In consequence of the rebellion of Don Frolia, not long after his
                    accession to the throne, he was forced to leave his kingdom; but that usurper
                    being assassinated, with universal applause he returned to his throne. In many
                    successful enterprises against the Moors, in which he greatly enlarged his
                    territories, he soon displayed the talents of a warlike and able prince. He
                    formed a powerful alliance against the Moors, by marrying Ximene or Chimene,
                    descended from the house· of Navarre, which paved the way for a long series of
                    victories. The great attention which he paid to the comfort and welfare of the
                    common people greatly disgusted his haughty nobles, which excited them to revolt
                    against him in the advanced part of his life. Enjoying a small interval of
                    tranquillity from the distraction and tumults of war, he called a ge <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193037037" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7037-0556"/>neral council of
                    the clergy and nobility, enacted some useful regulations, and directed their
                    attention to several other subjects, which contributed to the honour and
                    happiness of his kingdom. Whilst he was busily occupied in repairing some of
                    those towns which he had taken from the Moors, he was suddenly interrupted by
                    them, and was under the necessity of defending himself with a considerable army,
                    which he did with such success, that they were defeated with great loss. The
                    unnatural rebellion of his son Don Garcias, at this time, greatly disturbed his
                    government; but by the diligence of the father, this unnatural rebellion was
                    soon quelled. The confinement of Garcias, and the new imposition of taxes,
                    produced general murmurs among the people; which induced Alphonso, now worn out
                    with years and incessant contentions, to assemble the states, and resign the
                    reins of government into the hands of his son Don Garcias. He gave to his other
                    son Don Ordogno the province of Galicia. The ambitious and military spirit which
                    Don Garcias discovered in his father’s reign soon displayed itself in an attack
                    on the Moors. By the advice of his father, to which he prudently listened, he
                    was taught that these new conquests tended more to enrich the soldiers than to
                    promote the interest of the crown. Alphonso, though far advanced in years, took
                    upon himself the command of the army raised for new operations, and returned to
                    Zamora loaded with spoils, and with increased reputation and fame, in the year
                    91.2. He died on the 20th of December 912, two years after his abdication, 46
                    years from the time of his being associated with his father in the government,
                    and when he was about 64 or 65 years of age. His great learning, and the
                    patronage he gave to literature, his distinguished piety and virtue, and other
                    princely qualities, raised this king high in the estimation of mankind. Some
                    writers affirm that he composed a chronicle of the Spanish affairs, from the
                    death of Recesuintho to that of his own father Don Ordogno, which has been
                    incorrectly published by Sandoval, and the later editions have sustained
                    considerable injury.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps"/><hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonso</hi> X., surnamed the <hi
                    rend="italic">Wise,</hi> king of Leon and Castile, succeeded his father
                    Ferdinand in the year 1252. He obtained the appellation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >wise,</hi> not for his political knowledge as a king, but his erudition as a
                    philosopher. In consequence of the general opinion of his princely qualities,
                    and his uncommon generosity, he ascended the throne with universal approbation.
                    The ill-concerted projects of his ambition, however, disturbed the prosperity of
                    his reign. Pretending a better right than Henry III. of England to that
                    territory, he directed his first attempt against Gascony. The arms of England,
                    however, proved too formidable; and he was compelled to renounce his claim, on
                    condition that Henry’s son, afterwards King Edward I., should marry his sister
                    Eleonora. At an expense which drained his treasures, and obliged him to debase
                    his coin, he prepared for an expedition against the Moors in Barbary; but his
                    maternal right to the duchy of Şuabia, which he was called to defend, diverted
                    him from it. Thus he formed a connection with the German princes, and became a
                    competitor, with Richard earl of Cornwall, for the imperial crown, in quest of
                    which they both expended immense sums of money. The claims of several of the
                    princes of the blood gave exercise to his military talents, and he was
                    successful both in opposing and defeating them. He formed the romantic design of
                    visiting Italy in the year 1268; but the states firmly remonstrating, he was
                    obliged to relinquish it. But although he abandoned the design, yet it produced
                    such discontents among the common people, and conspiracy among the nobles, that
                    it required considerable exertion before the king could allay the ferment.
                    Alphonso being still desirous to ascend the imperial throne, attempted it after
                    the death of Richard earl of Cornwall, and even after Rodolph of Hapsburg was
                    actually elected emperor of Germany; and for that purpose took a journey to
                    Beau-caire, to obtain an interview with the pope, in order to prevent him from
                    confirming the election. The Moors ever ready to draw the sword against him,
                    took this op. ’ portunity of entering his dominions for the purpose of ravaging
                    them. This ambitious journey, undertaken at so vast an expense, and productive
                    of so much confusion in his kingdom, proved unsuccessful; for the pope would not
                    realize his claim, or alter the former election. But his excessive ambition was
                    soon punished by domestic calamity; for his eldest son died in this interval,
                    and his second son Don Sanchez, having obtained great reputation in opposing the
                    infidels, to the prejudice of his brother’s children, laid claim to the crown.
                    This claim was admitted by the states of the kingdom; but Philip king of France,
                    supporting the cause of the children, whose mother was his sister Blanche of
                    France, involved Al-phonso in a war; and it occasioned the retreat of his own
                    queen Yolande or Violante to the court of her father, the king of Arragon. While
                    thus harassed with dissensions, he proclaimed war against France, and by the
                    authority of the pope he renewed the war with the Moors, which proved so
                    unfortunate, that he reluctantly concluded a truce with them, and engaged in a
                    contest with the king of Granada. These various measures exhausted his treasure;
                    taxes were multiplied, and the affairs of the kingdom were in such confusion,
                    that he was under the disagreeable necessity of calling an assembly of the
                    states, which was held at Seville in the year 1281, where, on the king’s
                    proposal, the states consented to give a currency to copper money. In
                    consequence of the intrigues of Don Sanchez, his son, another assembly of the
                    states was held at Valladolid, A. D. 1282, which deprived Alphonso of the regal
                    dignity, and appointed Sanchez regent. Reduced to almost insurmountable
                    difficulties, Alphonso solemnly cursed and disinherited his son, and by his last
                    will, in the year 1283, confirmed the act of exclusion, and appointed for the
                    succession the infants de la Cerda, and, upon the failure of their heirs, the
                    kings of France; and at the same time supplicated the assistance of the king of
                    Morocco against the power of his son. At the commencement of the next year, when
                    Alphonso received information from Salamanca that Sanchez was dangerously ill,
                    his heart relented. He pardoned his son, revoked his curses, and then died, on
                    the 4th of April 1284, in the 81st year of his age. His remains were interred in
                    the cathedral of Seville; and he left behind him the character of a learned man,
                    but a weak king. Alphonso has been charged with irréligion and impiety, chiefly
                    on accountof a well-known but differently interpreted saying of his, viz, “if he
                    had been of God’s privy council when he created the world, he could have advised
                    him better.”</p>
                <p>He was an eminent proficient in science, and a patron of literature. He concluded
                    that book of laws known by the title of <hi rend="italic">Las Partidas,</hi>
                    which his father had begun; and in it displayed the abilities of a politician as
                    well as of a legislator. By obliging his subjects to use their own language, he
                    redressed the confusion in law proceedings occasioned by intermixing Latin with
                    the vulgar tongue. Under his patronage a general history of Spain was composed,
                    which he took great pains in polishing; he also corrected many errors in the
                    statutes of the university of Salamanca. Astronomy being his favourite study, he
                    chiefly directed his attention to the improvement or that science; so that, even
                    during the life of his father, he assembled at Toledo a number of the most,
                    celebrated as<pb break="no" facs="nls:193037050" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7050-0557"
                    />tronomers of hxs time, Christians, Jews, and Arabians, from all parts of
                    Europe, for the purpose of examining the astronomical tables of Ptolemy, and
                    correcting their errors. These tables, after employing them about four years,
                    were completed in 1252, the first year of Alphonso’s reign, and were called <hi
                    rend="italic">Alphonsine Tables,</hi> from the name of this prince, who, by his
                    unbounded liberality, encouraged the construction of them. It is reported that
                    400,000 ducats were expended on them, or, according to others, 40 000. A book
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The Treasure</hi> is also ascribed to him, containing
                    treatises of rational philosophy, physics, and ethics. He is likewise said to
                    have been well acquainted with astrology and chemistry, and in the latter
                    science to have compiled two volumes in cipher, which are still extant, and to
                    be found in his Catholic majesty’s library.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonso</hi> V. king of Arragon and Naples, succeeded his
                    father in the year 1416. As the father had formerly been honoured with the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">Just,</hi> so the son was honoured with that of
                    <hi rend="italic">Magnanimous.</hi> The conspiracy of some of his own nobles
                    against his life, together with the insolence of Pope Benedict XIII., greatly
                    disturbed the tranquillity of his reign. Fortunately, this conspiracy was
                    discovered just when it was about to be carried into execution; and, instead of
                    proceeding with rigour against the conspirators, he generously tore a paper
                    containing their names, without reading it, and added, that “he would at least
                    force them to acknowledge that he had a greater regard for their lives than they
                    had for his.” After quelling a disturbance in Sardinia, and while employed in
                    making preparations to advance to Sicily, Joan of Naples offered, if he would
                    assist her against the pope, the duke of Anjou, and the constable Sforza, who
                    had formed a confederacy to depose her, to adopt him as her son and heir. He
                    readily accepted the proposal, and with a powerful army soon raised the siege of
                    Naples, and was immediately declared heir apparent of her kingdom, and duke of
                    Calabria. The queen refusing to fulfil her* engagements, Alphonso took
                    possession of Naples, and expelled her from it; but when the duke of Anjou again
                    entered her territories, and made himself master of great part of them, she was
                    obliged to renew her solicitations to Alphonso, who, in the year 1434, involved
                    himself in a quarrel with the duke of Milan and the republic of Genoa, by
                    besieging Gaeta in a second attempt to conquer Naples. In an engagement with the
                    Genoese fleet, all his ships were dispersed or destroyed, and himself taken
                    prisoner; but such was the address of this prince, that when carried to Milan a
                    prisoner, he there ingratiated himself so much into the duke’s favour, that he
                    became his friend and ally, and soon rose to greater power than ever.</p>
                <p>He got possession of Naples in 1443; and in an assembly of the states held at
                    Beneventum, and afterwards transferred to Naples, his sovereignty was
                    recognised, and his son Don Ferdinand declared successor to the throne; and, in
                    consequence of this elevation, he was deemed the sole arbiter of peace and war
                    through all Italy. Naples became the residence of Alphonso during the remainder
                    of his life; but his declining years were much disquieted by political
                    dissensions and intrigues. Suspicion, the frequent attendant of old age, at last
                    seized him; and, in consternation and dread, he was removed from one castle of
                    Naples to another, until he breathed his last on the 22d of June 1468,
                    bequeathing to his natural son Ferdinand me kingdom of Naples, and to his
                    brother Don Juan, king of Navarre, the kingdoms of Arragon, Valencia, Majorca,
                    Sardinia, Sicily, and the principality and dependencies of atalonia. Alphonso
                    was not only deemed the ablest statesman and the most renowned military
                    commander in that age, but also the greatest prince that ever occupied the
                    throne of Arragon.</p>
