                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    fourth emperor of the Turks, and one of the greatest princes of the Ottoman
                    empire, succeeded Solyman in 1390. He took from the Greeks Gallipoli in Thrace,
                    and Adrianople, which last he chose for the place of his residence. He defeated
                    the prince of Bulgaria, conquered Misnia, chastised his rebellious bashaws, and
                    is said to have gained 36 battles. This prince, in order to form a body of
                    devoted troops that might serve as the immediate guards of his person and
                    dignity, appointed his officers to seize annually, as the imperial property, the
                    fifth part of the Christian youth <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038558"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8558-0673"/>taken in war. These, after being instructed in the
                    Mahometan religion, inured to obedience by severe discipline, and trained to
                    warlike exercises, were formed into a body distinguished by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Janizaries</hi> or <hi rend="italic">New Soldiers.</hi> The
                    Janizaries soon became the chief strength and pride of the Ottoman armies, and
                    were distinguished above all the troops whose duty it was to attend on the
                    person of the sultan. The death of Lazarus, despot of Servia, who had
                    endeavoured in vain to stop the progress of Amurath’s arms, touched Milo, one of
                    his servants, in so sensible a manner, that, in revenge, he stabbed the sultan
                    in the midst of his troops, and killed him upon the spot, <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps"/><hi rend="smallcaps">Amurath</hi> IL, the 10th emperor of
                    the Turks, was the eldest son of Mahomet I., and succeeded his father in 1421.
                    He besieged Constantinople and Belgrade without success; but he took
                    Thessalonica from the Venetians, and compelled the prince of Bosnia, and John
                    Castriot, prince of Albania, to pay him tribute. He obliged the latter to send
                    his three sons as hostages, among whom was George, celebrated in history by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Scanderbeg.</hi> John Hunniades defeated Amurath’s
                    troops, and obliged him to make peace with the Christian princes in 1442. These
                    princes afterwards breaking the peace, Amurath defeated them in the famous
                    battle of Varna, November 10, 1444, which proved so fatal to the Christians, and
                    in which Ladislaus king of Hungary was killed. He afterwards defeated Hunniades,
                    and killed above 20,000 of -his men; but George Castriot, better known by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Scanderbeg,</hi> being re-established in the estates
                    of his father, defeated the Turks several times, and obliged Amurath to raise
                    the siege of Croia, the capital of Albania. Amurath died, chagrined with his ill
                    success, and infirm with age, February 11, 1451, at Adrianople. It is observed
                    to this prince’s honour, that he always kept his treaties with the greatest
                    fidelity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amurath</hi> IV., surnamed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Valiant,</hi> was the son of Achmet I., and in the year 1622, at the age of 13,
                    succeeded his uncle Mustapha. Bagdad fell into the hands of the Persians, and
                    several other disastrous events clouded the commencement of his reign. The
                    recovery of Bagdad being a favourite object, in the year 1637 he marched against
                    it; and after thirty days of unremitting assault, with the expense of much
                    blood, he took possession of the city. By pushing his men forward to the attack
                    by the point of the scimitar, and by slaughtering 30,000 Persians in cold blood
                    after their surrender, he displayed the brutal ferocity of his disposition. One
                    person alone is reported to have moved his obdurate heart on the present
                    occasion. A famous player upon the harp entreated those who were sent to
                    massacre him to allow him to speak to the sultan previous to his death. Informed
                    who he was, the sultan requested him to give a specimen of his skill in his
                    profession: with this he readily complied, and touched his harp so melodiously,
                    and sung in such pathetic strains the lamentations on the tragedy of Bagdad,
                    intermixed with the praises of Amurath, that the hard heart of the cruel monarch
                    being at length softened, he melted into tears, and saved both the musician and
                    the remaining inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The violence of Amurath soon enfeebled his constitution; and the fruits of his
                    debaucheries and excesses were obvious even in the prime of life. At the age of
                    31 he fell a victim to an excess of revelling in the feast of Bairam, in the
                    year 1640.</p>
