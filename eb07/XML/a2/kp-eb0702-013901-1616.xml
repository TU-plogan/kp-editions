                <p><label type="entry">ADAMS</label>, a township of Berkshire county, in the state
                    of Massachusetts, in North America. It is 140 miles north-west of Boston, and
                    contains 2040 inhabitants. In the northern part of this district, a stream
                    called Hudson’s brook has worn a channel through a stratum of white marble, and
                    over the channel the rocks form a fine natural bridge, which is 12 or 15 feet
                    long, 10 feet broad, and more than 60 feet above the water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adams,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> a distinguished
                    statesman of the United States of North America. He was born on the 19th or (new
                    style) 30th of October 1736, in that part of the township of Braintree, in
                    Massachusetts, which on a subsequent division was called Quincey. His parents
                    were of that class, then abounding in New England, who united the profession of
                    agriculture with that of some one of the mechanic arts. His ancestor Henry had
                    emigrated from Devonshire in the year 1632, and had established himself at
                    Braintree with six sons, all of whom married: from one descended the subject of
                    this memoir, and from another that Samuel Adams who, with John Hancock, was by
                    name proscribed by an act of the British parliament, for the conspicuous part he
                    acted in the early stages of the opposition to the measures of the mother
                    country. When about 15 years of age, his father proposed to his son John either
                    to follow the family pursuits, and to receive in due time, as his portion, a
                    part of the estate which they had cultivated, or to have the expense of a
                    learned education bestowed upon him, with which, instead of any fortune, he was
                    to make his way in future life. The son chose the latter alternative; and having
                    received some preparatory instruction, was admitted a student at Howard College
                    in the year 1751. After passing about three years in that seminary, he removed
                    to the town of Worcester, where, according to the economical practice of that
                    day in New England, he became a tutor in a grammar school, and at the same time
                    was initiated into the practice of the law in the office of Mr Putnam, then an
                    attorney and a colonel of militia, and subsequently a general of some celebrity
                    in the revolutionary war. A letter of Mr Adams, which has lately come before the
                    public, written at the early age of 19, shows a degree of forecast which, like
                    many other productions, may have led to its own accomplishment. It is dated 12th
                    October 1755, and says, “Soon after the Reformation, a few people came over to
                    this new world for conscience’ sake. Perhaps this apparently trivial incident
                    may transfer the great seat of empire to America. It looks likely to me; for if
                    we can remove the turbulent Gallic (the French in Canada), our people, according
                    to the exactest computation, will in another century become more numerous than
                    England itself. Should this be the case, since we have, I may say, all the naval
                    stores of the nation in our hands, it will be easy to obtain the mastery of the
                    seas; and then the united force of all Europe will not be able to subdue us. The
                    only way to keep us from setting up for ourselves is to disunite us.”</p>
                <p>He was admitted to practice in the year 1758, and gradually rose to the degree of
                    eminence which a local court can confer; and obtained distinction by some essays
                    on the subject of the canon and feudal law, which were directed to point to the
                    rising difference which commenced between the mother country and the colonies,
                    soon after the peace of 1763 had delivered the latter from all disquietude
                    respecting the establishments of France in the adjoining province of Canada. His
                    character rose, both as a lawyer and a patriot, so as to induce Governor
                    Barnard, who wished to gain him over to the royal party, to offer him the office
                    of advocate-general in the Admiralty Court, which was deemed a sure step to the
                    highest honours of the bench. Two years after, he was chosen one of the
                    representatives of his native town to the congress of the province.</p>
                <p>His professional integrity was soon after exhibited in the defence of Captain
                    Preston and some soldiers, who were tried before a Boston jury on a charge of
                    murder. In this case Adams was counsel for the defence; and being considered by
                    the people, then in an inflamed state against the troops, as a determined friend
                    of liberty, his eloquence obtained a verdict of acquittal, without lessening his
                    popularity.</p>
                <p>When it was determined, in 1774, to assemble a general congress from the several
                    colonies, Mr Adams was one of those solicited for the purpose by the people of
                    Massachusetts. Before departing for Philadelphia to join the congress, he parted
                    with the friend of his youth, his fellow-student and associate at the bar,
                    Jonathan Sewall, who had attained the rank of attorney-general, and was
                    necessarily opposed to his political views. Sewall made a powerful effort to
                    change his determination, and to deter him from going to the congress. He urged,
                    that Britain was determined on her system, and was irresistible; and would be
                    destructive to him and all those who should persevere in opposition to her
                    designs. To this Adams replied: “I know that Great Britain has determined on her
                    system, and that very fact determines me on mine. You know I have been constant
                    and uniform in opposition to her measures; the die is now cast; I have passed
                    the Rubico; to swim or sink, live or die, survive or perish with my country, is
                    my unalterable determination.” The conversation was then terminated by Adams
                    saying to his friend, “I see we must part; and with a bleeding heart, I say, I
                    fear for ever. But you may depend upon jt, this adieu is the sharpest thorn on
                    which I ever set my foot.”</p>
                <p>When the continental congress was assembled, Mr Adams became one of its most
                    active and energetic leaders. He was a member of that committee which framed
                    the. declaration of independence, and one of the most powerful advocates for its
                    adoption by the general body; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031629"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1629-0140"/>and by his eloquence obtained the unanimous
                    suffrages of that assembly. Though he was appointed chief justice in 1776, he
                    declined the office, in order to dedicate his talents to the general purpose of
                    the defence of the country.</p>
                <p>In 1777, he, with three other members, was appointed a commissioner to France. He
                    remained in Paris about a year and a half, when, in conséquence of disagreements
                    among themselves, in which Adams was not implicated, all but Franklin were
                    recalled. In the latter end of 1779, he was charged with two commissions, one as
                    a plenipotentiary to treat for peace, the other empowering him to form a
                    commercial treaty with Great Britain. When arrived in Paris, the French
                    government viewed with jealousy the purpose of the second commission; and Count
                    de Vergennes advised him to keep it secret, with a view to prevail on the
                    congress to revoke it. Mr Adams refused to communicate to the Count his
                    instructions on that subject; and an altercation arose, from a claim made by
                    France for a discrimination in favour of French holders of American paper money
                    in the liquidation of it. The Count complained to congress, transmitted copies
                    of Mr Adams’ letters, and instructed the French minister at Philadelphia to
                    demand his recall. The demand was rejected, but afterwards four others were
                    joined with him in the commission. Whilst these negotiations were in progress,
                    he went to Holland, and there, in opposition to the influence and talents of the
                    British minister, Sir Joseph Yorke, succeeded both in negotiating a loan, and in
                    procuring the assistance of that country in the defence against Great Britain.
                    He formed a commercial treaty with that republic, and joined in the ephemeral
                    association called “the armed neutrality.”</p>
                <p>In 1785 Mr Adams was appointed ambassador to the court of his former sovereign,
                    where his conduct was such as to secure the approbation of his own country, and
                    the respect of that to which he was commissioned. Whilst in London, he published
                    his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Defence of the American Constitution,</hi>
                    in which he combated ab!y the opinions of Turgot, Mably, and Price, in favour of
                    a single legislative assembly; and thus perhaps contributed to the division of
                    power and the checks on its exercise, which became established in the United
                    States. At the close of 1787 he returned, after ten years devoted to the public
                    service, to America. He received the thanks of congress, and was elected soon
                    after, under the presidency of Washington, to the office of vice-president. In
                    1790 Mr Adams gave to the public his <hi rend="italic">Discourses</hi> on
                    Davila, in which he exposed the revolutionary doctrines propagated by France and
                    her emissaries in other countries. On the retirement of Washington, the choice
                    of president fell on Mr Adams, who entered on that office in May 1797. At that
                    time the government was entangled by the insolent pretensions of the French
                    demagogues, and by their partisans in many of the states. Great differences of
                    opinion arose between the individuals at the head of affairs: one party, with Mr
                    Hamilton at their head, was disposed to resist the pretensions of France by open
                    hostilities; whilst Mr Adams was disinclined to war, so long as there was a
                    possibility of avoiding it with honour. Owing to this division of his own
                    friends, rather than to a want of public confidence, at the conclusion of the
                    four years for which the president is chosen, Mr Adams was not re-elected.
                    Perhaps this was in some measure owing to the preponderance of the slave states,
                    in which Mr Jefferson, his rival, and a proprietor of slaves, had a
                    fellow-feeling among the chief of the people.</p>
                <p>He retired with dignity at 68 years of age to his native place, formed no
                    political factions against those in power, but publicly expressed his
                    approbation of the measures which were pursued by him who had been his rival,
                    who had become his successor in power, but had never ceased to be his firmly
                    attached friend.</p>
                <p>The last public occasion on which Mr Adams appeared, was as a member of the
                    convention for the revision of the constitution of Massachusetts, in which some
                    slight alterations were requisite, in consequence of the province of Maine being
                    separated from it.</p>
                <p>He seems to have enjoyed his mental faculties to the close of his protracted
                    life; and even on the last day of it, two hours only before its final close, on
                    the 4th July 1825, the fiftieth anniversary of the act of independence, he
                    dictated to a friend, as a sentiment to be given at the public dinner of the
                    day, “Independence for ever.”</p>
                <p>Mr Adams was considered as a sound scholar, well versed in the ancient languages,
                    and in many branches of general literature. His style in writing was forcible
                    and perspicuous, and, in the latter years of his life, remarkably elegant. In
                    person he was of middling stature; his manners spoke the courtesy of the old
                    school; and his address, at least when he was in England, was dignified and
                    manly. (θ.)</p>
