                <p><label type="entry">ALTING, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry</hi></label>, a German
                    divine, was born at Embden in 1583. His father was minister of the church of
                    Embden, and early destined his son to the same profession. In the year 1602,
                    after a grammatical course, he was sent to the university of Herborn: there he
                    studied with so much assiduity and success, that he soon had the honour of being
                    a preceptor. Qualified by the vigorous exertions of his talents, he was
                    appointed tutor to the three young <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037206"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-7206-0569"/>counts of Nassau, Solms, and Isenburg, who studied
                    with the elector prince palatine, first at Sedan, and afterwards ât Heidelberg.
                    A proper discharge of the duties of a lower station generally paves the way for
                    a higher: thus Alti∏g, being appointed preceptor to the prince in 1608, so
                    distinguished himself by his assiduity and success, that he was chosen to
                    accompany the elector into England. Among the number of celebrated men to whose
                    acquaintance he was introduced in England, was the famous Dr Abbot, archbishop
                    of Canterbury. In 1613 Alting, returning to Heidelberg after the marriage of the
                    elector with the princess of England, received his degree of doctor of divinity,
                    and was appointed director of the College of Wisdom. His increased knowledge and
                    invigorated talents were always receiving renewed opportunities of exertion; and
                    in the synod of Dort, to which he had been deputed by the palatinate, along with
                    other two divines, his eloquence and learning obtained full scope.</p>
                <p>From the avowed patronage of the elector it was but reasonable for Alting to
                    expect high preferment and important advantages; but in this he was greatly
                    disappointed, and he had only to participate in his misfortunes. In 1622 Count
                    Tilly took the city of Heidelberg, and devoted it to plunder. In order to escape
                    the fury of the soldiers, Alting endeavoured to pass by a back door into the
                    chancellor’s house, which was put under a strong guard; but as he was entering,
                    the officer who guarded the house said to him, “With this battle-axe I have
                    to-day killed ten men, and Alting, if I knew where to find him, should be the
                    eleventh: who are you ?” Alting, with a singular presence of mind, returned an
                    evasive answer, which saved his life. “I am,” said he, “a teacher in the College
                    of Wisdom.” The officer took him under his protection; but the Jesuits
                    unfortunately taking possession of the house the next day, left the generous
                    officer no time, at his departure, to take care of the teacher of the College of
                    Wisdom. Alting evaded the hands of the Jesuits by hiding himself in a garret;
                    and a cook of the electoral court, who happened to be employed by Count Tilly in
                    the kitchen occupied by him in the chancellor’s house, supplied him with food.
                    In this perilous situation he remained till an opportunity offered of making his
                    escape to Heilbron, whither his family had been previously conducted.</p>
                <p>But Alting was now as much harassed by ecclesiastical intolerance as he had
                    formerly been endangered by military hostility. With the permission of the duke
                    of Wirtemberg, he retired for <hi rend="italic">a few</hi> months to Schorndorf,
                    after the desolation of the palatinate by the victorious forces of Count Tilly.
                    It was natural for one who had just escaped the flames of a popish war, to
                    expect a welcome and hospitable reception among Protestants; but whatever might
                    have been their progress in the other doctrines of Christianity, those of
                    candour and mutual forbearance seem at that period to have occupied little of
                    their attention. The palatinate being in the vicinity of the duchy of
                    Wirtemberg, the professors of Tubingen and Heidelberg frequently attacked each
                    other in polemic writings and theological disputations. The natural consequence
                    was, that a settled jealousy and enmity arose between the two schools and their
                    respective vicinities. The injuries which Alting had suffered from the common
                    enemy were not sufficient to secure for him a friendly reception among the
                    Lutheran ministers of Schorndorf, who were involved in these feuds, and
                    therefore murmured at the permission which the duke had given to a professor of
                    Heidelberg to reside there. The mischievous effects of religious dissensions
                    have been universally felt.</p>
                <p>In 1623 Alting retired with his family to Embden, and afterwards followed to the
                    Hague his late pupil, now king of Bohemia. Such was the unfeigned attachment of
                    his master to him, that he still retained him as a preceptor to his eldest son;
                    and prevented him from accepting the charge of the church at Embden, and
                    likewise of a professorship at the university of Franeker. In 1627, by his
                    importunity he obtained leave from his patron to remove to Groningen, where he
                    was appointed to the divinity chair, and continued to lecture with increasing
                    reputation until the day of his death. The ardent desire and repeated endeavours
                    of several universities to appropriate to themselves the honour and benefit of
                    his services, is the most unequivocal proof of the general esteem in which his
                    character was held. The states of Groningen positively refused to give their
                    consent to his removal, when the university of Leyden solicited him to come and
                    labour among them. But some time after, the prospect of extensive usefulness in
                    re-establishing the university of Heidelberg, and restoring the churches of the
                    palatinate, determined him to accept the office of professor of divinity and
                    ecclesiastical senator, presented to him by Prince Lewis Philip. In the year
                    1634, amidst numerous hardships, to which the existing war exposed him, he set
                    out for Heidelberg, and pursued his journey as far as Frankfort; when the battle
                    of Norlingen, in which the imperialists were victorious, rendered his further
                    progress impracticable, and he therefore with great difficulty returned to
                    Groningen.</p>
                <p>Domestic affliction and personal sufferings embittered the remaining years of
                    this excellent man’s life. The death of his eldest daughter, for whom he
                    entertained an ardent affection, brought on a deep melancholy, accompanied with
                    bodily disease, which was with great difficulty removed; but after an interval
                    of four years, the loss of an amiable and beloved wife occasioned the return of
                    his malady, which in a few months put a period to his useful life, in the year
                    1644.</p>
                <p>Alting was a man of eminent talents, extensive learning, and amiable
                    dispositions, and always more solicitous to serve the public than to benefit
                    himself. His character and misfortunes cannot fail deeply to interest every
                    reader. He was averse to quarrels and disputes about trifles, although no friend
                    to the innovations introduced at this period by the Socinians; and, adhering to
                    what he considered the plain doctrine of Scripture, he was equally desirous to
                    avoid fanatical scrupulosity and sophistical subtiltý. The productions of his

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alting,</hi><hi rend="italic">James,</hi> son of Henry
                    Alting, was born at Heidelberg in 1618. After the usual course of grammatical
                    studies he became a student, and soon after professor of divinity, in the
                    university of Groningen. The oriental, languages were his favourite studies at
                    an early period of his life; and in 1638 he put himself under the tuition of a
                    Jewish rabbi at Embden. Determining to take up his residence in England, he
                    arrived there in 1640, and was admitted to clerical orders by Dr Prideaux,
                    bishop of Worcester. By an offer of the Hebrew professorship in the, university
                    of Groningen, he was soon induced to alter his plan of life, and consequently
                    returned to Germany in 1643. His active assiduity in the study of these
                    languages, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037219" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7219-0570"/>and
                    his knowledge in other sciences, procured him universal esteem and great
                    reputation as a scholar. About this time he received many academic honours: he
                    was admitted doctor of philosophy, academic preacher, and at last, in
                    conjunction with a colleague, Samuel des Marets, was chosen professor of
                    divinity. These professors followed different methods of teaching, and adopted
                    different systems. Des Marets was an admirer and follower of the subtilties of
                    the scholastics, and, by the ingenuity with which he pursued the scholastic plan
                    of instruction, had acquired great reputation and considerable influence. Alting
                    spent his time in the study of the Scriptures and in the pursuit of rabbinical
                    learning; and he delivered a course of lectures on divinity, which gained him
                    great popularity. As might naturally be expected, a jealousy arose between the
                    two professors; and their respective partisans in the university carried their
                    animosity to an*undue height. Established opinion and the weight of authority
                    marshalled on the side of Des Marets. By the permission of the curators of the
                    university he appeared as public accuser of Alting, and produced a long list of
                    erroneous propositions to the divines of Leyden, for their opinion. The judgment
                    of the divines upon the dispute shows a great degree of moderation and good
                    sense: they pronounced Alting innocent of heresy, but imprudently fond of
                    innovation; and they declared Des Marets deficient in modesty and candour. If
                    the superiors had not prohibited the further discussion of these subjects in the
                    consistories, classes, and synods, they would have occasioned as much mischief
                    as they had excited general attention. Such was the protection given to Alting,
                    that whenever any of the order of ecclesiastics proposed any further measures
                    against him, they were immediately rejected by the civil power; nay, the penalty
                    of deprivation was decreed against those clergy who should revive the <hi
                    rend="italic">Maresio-Altingian</hi> controversy. Whatever might be the
                    advantages resulting to Alting from this protection, the magistrates certainly
                    did wrong in proceeding so far in prohibiting a discussion from the press, of
                    the judgments of the divines of Leyden. Although a kind of reconciliation was
                    attempted by their common friends while Des Marets lay upon his death-bed, yet
                    the breach between Des Marets and Alting was never perfectly healed. Dr Alting
                    died of a fever in 1679. The fondness which he showed for rabbinical learning
                    gave birth to the general report that he was inclined to become a Jew. His
                    opinions, which seem to have excited more general attention than they deserve,
                    may be seen at large in his writings, which were collected a few years after his
                    death, and published in five volumes folio, by his cousin Menso Alting, who
                    wrote a good description of the Low Countries, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Notitia Germanice Inferioris.</hi></p>
