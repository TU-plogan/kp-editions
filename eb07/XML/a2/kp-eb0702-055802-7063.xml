                <p><label type="entry">ALPS</label>. On taking a general view of the continent of
                    Europe, we can distinguish two great mountain masses, from which proceed the
                    various chains of mountain groups that characterize it. The first of these is
                    the mountain mass of <hi rend="italic">St Gothard,</hi> in Switzerland, between
                    the sources of the Rhine, the Rhone, the Etch, and the Aar: the second is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Wolchonshy-wald,</hi> in Russia, between the Wolga and the
                    sources of the Don, Dnieper, and Dwina.</p>
                <p>The mountains connected with St Gothard are the Alps, which in their full extent
                    reach from long. 4° 20 ’ to 19° E. from Paris, and from lat. 44° to 47° N. The
                    central point of the Alps is in Switzerland, the numerous branches of it
                    extending through Savoy, France, Italy, Germany, Croatia, and Sclavonia. They
                    are bounded on the south-west by the Rhone, in southern France; on the
                    north-east by the Danube, in Hungary; on the south and south-east by the
                    Mediterranean Şea, and the rivers Kulpa and Sau; on the north and north-west by
                    the Danube, in Germany; by the Rhine on the northern boundary of Switzerland;
                    and by the Doubs on the Jura. Hence it appears that this great high land passes
                    through France, Savoy, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Croatia, and Sclavonia. The
                    southern part of the chain in Croatia, in long. 35°, does not reach its
                    extremity, but continues onwards to the left bank of the Sau and Danube, fully
                    ten degrees of longitude farther.</p>
                <p>In the Celtic language, the word <hi rend="italic">alb, alp</hi> according to
                    some authors, signifies <hi rend="italic">white.</hi> As the highest peaks of
                    this Alpine land are perpetually covered with snow, they were by the ancient
                    inhabitants named Alps; by the Greeks Αλτε/¢, who, however, knew only the
                    Maritime Alps; by the Romans Alpes, and by modern writers Alps.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some authors derive Alp from
                    αZδ, a verdant height.</p></note></p>
                <p>The Romans, although they knew well that the Gauls under Bellovesus (620 years
                    before Christ) made an irruption into Upper Italy across the Alps, were entirely
                    ignorant of the route he followed. It was not until Hannibal had crossed the
                    Alps (300 years after Bello-vesus) that the Romans thought of examining this
                    grand barrier. Polybius described the Alpine country traversed by the military
                    host under Hannibal, fifty years after that remarkable event; and Cincius
                    Alimentus heard Hannibal himself detail his passage of the Alps. Livy, and other
                    writers, both Latin and Greek, also speak of the Alps. Fifty-two years after
                    Hannibal’s irruption into Italy (in the year of Rome 587, before Christ 178),
                    the Romans, under the consuls Claudius and Marcellus, conquered the Cisalpine
                    Gauls, who inhabited the country between the Po and the Alps; and seven years
                    afterwards, under Fulvius Nobilis, they for the first time crossed the Alps to
                    Nice and Antibes, in order to aid the Marsilians against the Ligurians. For one
                    hundred and fifty years from this period, the Romans frequently traversed this
                    chain, partly with the view of subjugating the various tribes inhabiting it, and
                    partly in extending their conquests into Spain, Gaul, and Germany. After the
                    death of Caesar, the whole Alpine population threw off the Roman yoke. The
                    emperor Augustus sent against them (in the year of Rome 747, before Christ 18)
                    his legions, under Drusus, Tiberius, Terentius Varro, and Lucius Silus. This
                    long-continued warfare terminated in the conquest of forty-six Alpine tribes or
                    nations, whose names were inscribed on the celebrated triumphal arch of
                    Augustus, erected near Nice. From this period until the fifth century after
                    Christ, the Romans continued in complete possession of the north and south sides
                    of the Alps.</p>
                <p>During the long domination of the Romans, the Alps received the following names,
                    which are still retained by geographers, viz. Maritime, Cottian, Grecian,
                    Pennine, Leopontine, Rhaetian, Noric, Carnic, Julian, and Dinarian.</p>
                <p>DIVISIONS OF THE ALPS.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Maritime Alps</hi> (Alpes Maritimae).—These extend from the
                    coast of the Mediterranean Sea, between Oneglia' and Toulon, across the Cols
                    Ardente and Tende, to Mont Viso (Vesulus), separating Piedmont from Provence and
                    the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Cottian Alps</hi> (Alpes Cottiae) extend from Mont Viso by
                    Mont Genevre to Mont Cenis, a distance of twenty-five leagues, thus separating
                    Piedmont from Dau-phiny. It is in this range that we first meet with heights
                    analogous to those of the central chains of the Alps. The Po and the Durance
                    rivers have their sources here. The name is derived from Cottius, who, in the
                    time of Caesar and Augustus, had his chief place of residence at Seguvium, the
                    present Susa, and ruled as king or chief of this part of the Alps.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Grecian or Grey Alps</hi> (Alpes Graiae) extend from Mont
                    Cenis, across the Ieran and the Little St Bernard, to the Col de Bonhomme,
                    separating Piedmont from Savoy. They were named Grey Alps from their grey
                    colour, owing to the partial cover of snow. The Little St Bernard is considered
                    as the Alpis Graia of the ancients.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Pennine Alps</hi> (Alpes Penninae), also named by Caesar
                    Alpes Summae, extend from the Bonhomme across Mont Blanc, the Great St Bernard,
                    Combon, onwards to Mont Cervin and Mont Rosa, separating Piedmont from Savoy and
                    the Lower Vallais. The Celts named every high mountain a Penn; hence the
                    loftiest summits and the most exalted of their deities were named Penn. In the
                    time of the Romans, in one of the valleys, a temple was built, and a statue
                    erected in it, to one of their gods, named Penn, by the Romans Deus Penninus,
                    and afterwards Jupiter Penninus. Hence these Alps were named Alpes Penninae. In
                    this part of the great Alpine range there occur Mont Blanc, the highest mountain
                    in Europe, and Mont Rosa, the next in elevation to that monarch of European
                    mountains.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Leopontine Alps,</hi> also named Alps of Switzerland, or
                    Aulae. They extend from Mont Rosa on both sides of the Rhone, or valley of the
                    Vallais, across St Gothard, the Moschelhorn, and Bernardino in the Grisons, thus
                    separating Lombardy from Switzerland. The distance from St Gothard to Bernardino
                    is 15 leagues. They were named Leopontine after a people, the Leopontii, who
                    formerly inhabited the confines of Rhaetia, Helvetia, and Italy.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037076" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7076-0559"/>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Rh(etiun Alps</hi> (Alpes Rhaeticae) extend from Bernardino
                    through the whole of the Grisons and the Tyrol, to the Dreiherrn peak, on the
                    borders of Saltzburg and Carinthia, and more southerly to Mont Pelegrino; thus
                    separating Lombardy and a great part of the Venetian terra firma from Northern
                    Rhaetia and Germany.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Noric Alps</hi> (Alpes Noricae) extend from the Dreiherrn
                    peak through the whole of Carinthia, on the left bank of the Drau, through
                    Saltzburg, Austria, and Styria, to the Oedenburg plain in Hungary. They have
                    their name from the Roman town Noricum.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comic Alps</hi> (Alpes Carniae) extend from Pelegrino,
                    between the rivers Drau and Śau, to Terglou, at the source of the Sau.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Julian Alps</hi> (Alpes Juliae) extend from Terglou, between
                    the right bank of the Sau, the Kulpa, and the Adriatic Sea, to the rock Kleck,
                    near Zenk in Dalmatia; thus separating the Friaul from Idrìa, and in general the
                    whole of Upper Italy from Carinthia, Carniola, Croatia, and Servia. The present
                    Civita di Friuli occupies the site where formerly stood the Forum Julii, which
                    gave name to this division of the Alps.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Dinarian Alps·,</hi> so named from Mons Adrius, extend from
                    Kleck to Sophia, ranging along the right bank of the Sau and Danube, and join
                    the Haemus or Balkan, on the Black Sea.</p>
                <p>The general direction of the Alps, excluding the Maritime Alps, which range
                    nearly from south to north, is from west-south-west to east-north-east. The most
                    considerable valleys, those named <hi rend="italic">longitudinal.,</hi> run
                    parallel with the direction of the chain; and others, named <hi rend="italic"
                    >transverse,</hi> run from south and south-east to north and northwest, or from
                    north and north-west to south and southeast.</p>
                <p>The great crest of the Alps, the <hi rend="italic">watershed</hi> (divortia
                    aquarum) of this vast high land has declining from it two acclivities, one
                    towards the north, the other towards the south. The north acclivity declines
                    towards the ocean, the North Sea, and the Baltic; the south acclivity towards
                    the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. The northern acclivity has a gentle
                    inclination, and is much more extensive than the southern, which is
                    comparatively abrupt and steep. From the nature of these two acclivities or
                    inclined plains, we naturally expect to find the principal and most numerous
                    secondary chains on the northern, and this is actually the case. Mont St
                    Gothard, in some degree the central point of the whole chain, is distant in a
                    straight line from the Mediterranean about 52 leagues, from the Adriatic 75
                    leagues, from the ocean 175 leagues, from the North Sea 168 leagues, from the
                    Baltic 185 leagues.</p>

                            of Marengo. It was improved by the emperor at an expense of nine
                            millions of francs. It runs along the Savoy side of the lake of Geneva,
                            and connects the ridge of the Jura with the Alps. At St Maurice it falls
                            in with the road that traverses the Swiss margin of the lake, passes up
                            the Vallais beyond Sion, and conducts the traveller to the lakes

                <p>The cold of the atmosphere continually increases with the elevation; and at a
                    certain height, depending on climate or latitude, perpetual frost prevails.
                    Where the earth’s surface attains this height, it is, with the exception of
                    mural precipices, continually covered with snow. The snow increases from season
                    to season; for though it may melt slowly from the heat of the ground on which it
                    rests, yet it suffers little loss externally in the way of melting, except what
                    the air carries off by evaporation. If in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh we had
                    mountains 6000 feet high, their summits would be always covered with snow, and
                    consequently we should here have perpetual snow within a few hours’ walk. But in
                    Great Britain none of the mountains reach to the snow line of the latitude,—an
                    arrangement very different from what prevails in the Alps, where whole ranges
                    are covered with eternal snow. When mountains are covered with perpetual snow,
                    its lower limit, or the snow line, descends in winter and rises again in summer;
                    so that in the Alps in winter the snow line reaches the low country, while in
                    summer it ascends, and in the autumn, when the heat is greatest, it attains its
                    maximum of height.</p>
                <p>The lower edge of the snow line differs much from that above it, and might more
                    properly be called the <hi rend="italic">ice line,</hi> because the snow, owing
                    to the influence of rain, the heat of the sun, and the heat of the earth, is
                    there partially melted every summer, and frozen again in the winter, forming an
                    icy boundary. This ice is named <hi rend="italic">glacier ice,</hi> or simply
                    <hi rend="italic">glacier.</hi> Above this zone, the region of the glaciers, the
                    snow is seldom moistened by rain or softened by the rays of the sun. These
                    glaciers or vast accumulations of ice have received particular names in
                    different parts of the Alps. Those in Dauphiny and Savoy are named <hi
                    rend="italic">glacier;</hi> in Switzerland, <hi rend="italic">gletcher</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> in the Grisons, <hi rend="italic">wader</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> in the Tyrol, <hi rend="italic">ferner;</hi> in Salzburg
                    and Carinthia, <hi rend="italic">has;</hi> and by the Italians who inhabit the
                    Alps, <hi rend="italic">vedretto.</hi> They fill all the upper, and principally
                    the transverse valleys, from Dauphiny to the frontier of Salzburg: few of them
                    are less than three' miles, many 18 or 20 miles in length, from one to two miles
                    broad, and from 100 to 600 feet thick. They frequently run into each other, and
                    thus surround the peaks on all sides, in such a manner that they appear rising
                    like islands through a sea of ice. Where the glaciers are largest, they send
                    down great arms or branches into the cultivated country, and into the fruitful
                    valleys, 3000 feet above the sea. The chain of Mont Blanc affords a striking
                    example of these descending arms; for there are twenty-five glaciers, descending
                    from it into the valleys of Chamouny, Entreves, and Bionnay. The glaciers are
                    frequently traversed by rents, often of great width and depth; so that when hid
                    by a thin covering of snow or ice they become extremely dangerous to travellers.
                    It is therefore proper to have experienced guides when visiting the dreary and
                    desolate scenes where they occur. The unfortunate Mr Escher, mentioned by Μ. de
                    Luc, was cautioned by his guide not to separate from his companions when they
                    arrived at the glacier. Hurried on, however, by that indescribable sensation
                    which people sometimes experience when they reach lofty summits, and observing
                    at the top of the glacier, a little distance before him, two chamois hunters,
                    who were resting themselves, he hastened to join them; but he disappeared in a
                    moment, and was precipitated to the bottom of a frightful fissure. He met with
                    an instantaneous death, which was caused by the compression of his body in the
                    narrow part of the rent. Bodies of those destroyed in fissures are sometimes
                    brought to light by the glacier streams. Other adventurers have been even less
                    fortunate than Escher; for there are instances in the melancholy records of
                    these dreary regions, of bodies having been found uninjured, lying on projecting
                    ledges in the fissures, and even sometimes suspended in narrow parts of these
                    horribly dark gulfs; thus showing that the wretched sufferers had had a slow and
                    awful death. All around the lower edges of the glaciers there are vast heaps of
                    stones: these are partly masses which have fallen from the mountains, on their
                    surface, or which have been thrown from under the glacier in its progress
                    downwards. The collection of earth and stones is termed by the inhabitants of
                    Switzerland, <hi rend="italic">moraine.</hi></p>
                <p>The glaciers are not stationary, but occasionally move downward, and with a
                    motion more or less quick. The movement of the glacier sometimes takes place
                    unexpectedly, as was experienced by the priest of the Grindenwald, who, along
                    with a chamois hunter, felt the glacier over which they were travelling moving
                    under them. The travellers were resting themselves, and had lighted their pipes,
                    when suddenly a frightful noise resembling thunder was heard. Every thing around
                    them began to move: their fowling-pieces, which they had laid on the ice, moved
                    about. Masses of rock, which a few moments before lay quietly on the surface of
                    the glacier, bounded about in all directions; fissures closed with a loud noise,
                    like that of cannon, and forced the water contained in them several fathoms
                    upwards. New rents, from 10 to 12 feet, burst open with indescribably
                    disagreeable noises. The whole mass of the glacier moved forward several yards:
                    a dreadful convulsion appeared approaching; but in a few seconds all was still
                    again, and the dead silence was interrupted only by the call of the marmot. The
                    total number of glaciers in the whole range of the Alps may be between 500 and
                    600, which together form an icy sea of enormous extent.</p>
                <p>These are masses of snow separated from the general snowy cover, which in their
                    course downwards carry <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037102"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-7102-0561"/>ing along with them fragments of rock, and
                    branches and trunks of trees, rapidly increase in size, and sometimes, before
                    reaching the bottom of the valleys, have accumulated to an enormous magnitude.
                    They destroy houses and villages, break down whole forests, and sometimes even
                    interrupt the course of rivers. Those who are unfortunately enveloped in these
                    avalanches have little chance of escape. In 1478 sixty soldiers in the district
                    of St Gothard were destroyed by an avalanche. One hundred men were enveloped in
                    an avalanche in the Great St Bernard, in the year 1500. In 1595 the course of
                    the Rhine was so much interrupted by the fall of a great avalanche across it,
                    that the water rose and drowned many men and cattle. In 1624 three hundred
                    soldiers were enveloped in an avalanche in Italian Switzerland, but the greater
                    number were dug out alive. Many other details of a similar description are to be
                    found in the records of modern travellers.</p>
                <p>The snows and glaciers of the Alps aIready described are the never-failing
                    sources of water for the great rivers which rise from them, as the Rhine, Po,
                    Danube, and Rhone.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants, as is well known, are in many respects highly interesting, more
                    especially those inhabiting the more remote and magnificent districts. The
                    population of the whole range may be between 6,000,000 and 7,000,000. Of these,
                    from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 belong to the Celto-Gallic stem, from 800,000 to
                    900,000 to the Italian, about 1,000,000 to the Sclavonian, and nearly 5,000,000
                    to the German states. Among these there may be at least 1,500,000 who lead a
                    pastoral life, and who occupy themselves exclusively with Alpine economy and the
                    rearing of cattle.</p>
                <p>In the Alps the upper limit of vegetation ascends above the snow line; for we
                    observe plants growing on mountains situated above that line, but which are so
                    steep that snow will not lie on their sides. Thus, an androsacea and a silene
                    were found growing at a height of 1590 toises, on the mountains around Mont
                    Blanc. At an elevation of 1728 toiscs, on the same group of mountains, there
                    were found, growing and in a healthy state, a cardamine, a draba, a gentian, and
                    other plants that do not fear the glacier zone. At elevations between 1282 and
                    1180 toises, where the snow and glaciers cease, we find growing, not upon rock,
                    but on a fertile soil watered by the snow-water, dwarf willows in the midst of
                    Alpine herbaceous plants. This region presents here and there islands or patches
                    of snow, in places screened from the sun’s rays. In the bare patches of ground
                    among these islands, excellent clover grows, which, however, can only be reached
                    by traversing these snowy patches. Lower down we reach that Alpine region so
                    celebrated for the magnificent pasturages it contains; and still lower, between
                    1180 and 770 toises, new plants make their appearance; viz. the rhododendron
                    ferrugineum, the rhododendron hirsutum, and ericaea or heaths. We find the alder
                    at 1000 toises; and here we enter into the region of trees. The <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">pinus picea,</hi> or pitch pine, at 750; the birch at 750 and
                    700; the yew at 700. The region of great trees does not ascend higher than 680
                    toises; beech stops here. Oaks do not pass beyond 550 toises. At this height the
                    <hi rend="italic">cerealia</hi> cannot be advantageously cultivated. The cherry
                    ranges upwards as high as 500 toises; nut-tree and chestnut to 400 toises. The
                    vine is planted as high as 280. The olive is cultivated at the foot of the Alps,
                    and on the coast of Italy; and there also we find the orange, the citron, and
                    other trees. Local circumstances occasion changes in the limits of these
                    vegetables: barley, oats, and wheat range to 700, and even to 900 toises.</p>
                <p>The animal world exhibits similar distributions with the vegetable. Thus, the
                    ibex and the chamois occur among the most elevated summits, amidst snow and ice;
                    but of these two quadrupeds, the chamois in general occupies a lower situation
                    than the ibex. Lower down we meet with the marmot and the white hare, the bear
                    and the mole; still nearer the low country, wolves, foxes, the lynx and the wild
                    cat.</p>
                <p>Among the feathered creation the feathered vulture or lammergeyer is the species
                    which is observed at the greatest heights, being seen soaring above very lofty
                    snow-covered pinnacles. The ptarmigan wanders along the edge of the snowline;
                    the heath-cock frequents pine forests; the grey partridge and other birds occur
                    in still lower regions. Various aquatic birds frequent the lakes and rivers, and
                    have also their appropriate distribution. The distribution of fishes is also
                    interesting, as they occur at different heights, whether in lakes or rivers.
                    Where the water is abundantly supplied from the glaciers, fishes do not thrive,
                    and are rarely to be found. Insects, too, as we shall partially explain in our
                    article on the geography of the animal world, are met with in the Alps, from
                    spots amidst the snows of the loftiest peaks to the deepest valleys, increasing
                    in number, variety, and beauty, as we approach the lower country. Even the
                    testaceous molluseae, and creatures lower in the animal scale, exhibit on the
                    great acclivities of the Alps a similar mode of distribution.</p>
                <p>In this vast high land there are examples of all the different rock formations of
                    which the crust of the earth is composed, from the deepest-seated primitive rock
                    to the most superficial and newest alluvial deposite. The higher and also many
                    of the deeper ranges and valleys are composed of <hi rend="italic">primitive
                    rocks,</hi> viz. granite, gneiss, mica slate, clay slate, limestone, trap,
                    porphyry, syenite, serpentine, and quartz rock. Resting upon these, and
                    frequently at a great height, rocks of the <hi rend="italic">transition</hi>
                    class appear, as grey wacke, clay slate, quartz rock, granite, gneiss, mica
                    slate, limestone, syenite, trap and serpentine. The <hi rend="italic">secondary
                    rocks,</hi> or those of the third class, although frequently occurring at a
                    great height, yet more generally occupy lower situations than the primitive and
                    transition rocks. The following secondary deposites are enumerated by authors as
                    occurring in the Alps. We enumerate them in their order of deposition, beginning
                    with the first or oldest.</p>
                <p>1. First secondary sandstone, or coal formation.</p>
                <p>2. First secondary limestone, or magnesian limestone.</p>
                <p>3. Second secondary sandstone, or new red sandstone.</p>
                <p>4. Second secondary limestone, or shell limestone.</p>
                <p>5. Third secondary sandstone, or keuper sandstone and marl.</p>
                <p>6. Third secondary limestone, or Jura, and Lias, and Oolite limestones.</p>
                <p>7. Fourth secondary sandstone, or green and iron sand, and quader-sandstone
                    formation.</p>
                <p>8. Fourth secondary limestone, the chalk deposite of geologists.</p>
                <p>Resting upon these secondary deposites, we find in many parts vast accumulations
                    of strata of newer rocks belonging to the fourth or <hi rend="italic">tertiary
                    class.</hi> These tertiary deposites consist of sand, sandstone, and
                    conglomerate; of clays, marls, and coals, and of various limestones; all more or
                    less abounding in fossil organic remains. The bottoms of the valleys, even their
                    sides to a considerable height, are more or less covered with clays, sands,
                    rolled masses, &amp;c., belonging to the <hi rend="italic">diluvium</hi> of
                    authors. And we find in every situation, from the lofty peak to the bottom of
                    the deep valley, spread over the other deposites already enumerated, a more or
                    less deep cover of that alluvial detritus<pb break="no" facs="nls:193037115"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-7115-0562"/> which is daily forming, and which consists of
                    broken masses more or less angular, gravel, sand, clay, loam-clay, shell-marl,
                    peat, &amp;c. The common vegetable soil rests upon this alluvium, in beds
                    varying in thickness from a few inches to several feet.</p>
                <p>These secondary and tertiary rocks are variously inter· mingled with trap and old
                    volcanic rocks, and the diluvial and alluvial deposites with newer igneous or
                    volcanic rocks.</p>
                <p>No fossil organic remains occur in the primitive rocks; few appear in those of
                    the transition class; whereas in the various members of the secondary and
                    tertiary classes fossil plants and animals are abundant, and so disposed as to
                    assist in characterizing the different deposites or formations. The diluvial and
                    alluvial deposites also abound in fossil organic remains; but for details we
                    refer to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Geology.</hi></p>
                <p>Varieties of almost every species of the European simple minerals are met with in
                    the Alps or their connecting chains; and in the long range of this high land we
                    find gold, and many different and valuable ores of silver, lead, copper, iron,
                    bismuth, nickel, cobalt, zinc, manganese, mercury, antimony, arsenic, molybdena,
                    uranium, titanium, and tungsten. These ores occur in veins, beds, imbedded
                    masses, or are disseminated in rocks of various descriptions, particularly those
                    of the primitive and transition classes.</p>
                <p>The loftiest and most interesting mountains are Mont Blanc, Mont Rosa, the Great
                    Glockner, and the Ortler. ’ The ascent to the summits of these cold⅜εal masses
                    exhibits all those varied displays of scenery, of ch∙⅛ιate, and of distribution
                    of animal, vegetable, and mineral production which so much excite the curiosity
                    of the traveller and the naturalist. The ascent to the summit of the Great
                    Glockner and the Order Spitze is described by Schultes and other travellers;
                    that of Mont Rosa by Saussure, but more particularly by Von Welden, in his
                    account of that mountain. Mont Blanc being more in the track of travellers, has
                    excited greater attention than any of the other great Alpine mountains. To reach
                    the summit of the highest mountain in Europe has always been an object of desire
                    with adventurous travellers; hence repeated attempts have been made to reach the
                    top of Mont Blanc. Some of these have been successful, others have been the
                    contrary. The first attempt to reach the summit was made in the year 1762, by
                    Pierre Simon of Chamouny, who endeavoured to accomplish it by the Glacier du
                    Buissons, and again from the French side; but failed in both. Another
                    unsuccessful attempt was made by some villagers in 1773; and again in 1783 by Μ.
                    Bourrit of Geneva. Bourrit made a second attempt in 1784, which was also
                    unsuccessful. In</p>
                <p>1785 Μ. de Saussure, Μ. Bourrit, and Μ. Bourrit junior, with fifteen guides, left
                    Bionassy in the beginning of September, and ascended the glacier of the same
                    name. They slept near the base of the Arguille du Gouté, and next day climbed to
                    the summit of it; but the snow was so soft that they could proceed no farther.
                    They returned to the ,placé where they had slept the night before, and next day
                    descended into the valley. In June</p>
                <p>1786 six Chamouny guides next attempted it, but gave it up through fatigue and
                    fear: they were alarmed by the black appearance of the sky. Jacques Balma, as
                    they were returning, strayed from the party, and lost his way among the hills
                    and blocks of ice on the glacier, and was unable to regain his party. He
                    remained all night in some hole or cave which he found in the ice. Next morning
                    he wandered about, and discovered a route by which he thought he could reach the
                    summit, and then returned to Chamouny with a determination to keep it a secret.
                    Dr Pachard, a native of Chamouny, had some suspicion that Balma knew an
                    accessible track leading to the summit, and tried in vain to get this
                    information from him; but they agreed at last to go together and make the
                    attempt. Therefore, on the 7th of August 1786, they left the Priory, and slept
                    on the summit of the mountain of La Cote. Thence they started next morning at
                    four o’clock; and after surmounting many difficulties, they attained the summit
                    at half-past six in the evening. They left it at seven, and about midnight
                    arrived at the spot where they had slept the night before; and at eight o’clock
                    on the morning of the 9th returned to Chamouny. Μ. de Saussure having heard of
                    the success of this journey, hastened to the valley, and, with seventeen guides,
                    immediately attempted to follow the route of Jacques Balma; but from the bad
                    state of the weather he did not succeed. In July 1787 Saussure sent Balma to
                    reconnoitre the glacier, who reported that it was not in a fit state; but on the
                    lst of August this illustrious philosopher and indefatigable traveller left
                    Chamouny at seven A. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.,</hi> with a servant and eighteen
                    guides. At two o’clock they arrived on the summit of the mountain of La Cote.
                    Next day they crossed the glacier, and halted on the. second plateau at four.
                    Here they passed the night, and next day gained the summit at eleven in the
                    forenoon. They remained on it for nearly four hours, leaving it at about three
                    o'clock, and descended to about 1100 yards below the summit, slept there, and
                    next day reached the Priory. Μ. Bourrit set out on the enterprise on the day of
                    their return, but bad weather drove him back. On the 9th August of the same
                    year, Colonel Beaufoy, with ten guides, attained the summit, having left
                    Chamouny the day before, and returned to it on the 10th. He was enabled to
                    ascertain that the latitude of the summit of Mont Blanc is 45° 49' 59" N. At
                    twelve o’clock the mercury in the thermometer stood at 38° in the shade. At the
                    same hour, in Chamouny, and in the shade, it stood at 78°. In 1788 Μ. Bourrit,
                    his son, Mr Woodley, and Mr Camper, set out together; but when at a great
                    height, a severe storm separated the party, of whom Mr Woodley was the only one
                    who reached the summit, which was on the 5th of August. He and his guides
                    suffered severely. Μ. Bourrit never attempted the ascent again. In 1791 four
                    Englishmen made an unsuccessful attempt to reach the summit. On the 10th of
                    August 1802 a native of Lausanne and a German, with seven guides, reached the
                    summit. They remained on it twenty minutes, and then descended part of the way,
                    performing the remainder and arriving at Chamouny on the llth, having taken
                    three days to accomplish it. On the 10th of September 1812 Μ. Rodalz of Hamburg
                    got to the summit.' On the 4th of August 1818 a Russian gentleman reached the
                    summit. On 12th July 1819 Dr∙ Van Ranselaer and Mr Howard, Americans, ascended
                    the mountain and reached the summit; and on the 13th of August of the same year
                    Captain Undrell, R. N. made a successful attempt. On the 19th August 1820 Dr
                    Hamel, a Moscovite, with three gentlemen and twelve guides, ascended to the
                    great plateau. In climbing from it up the side of Mont Blanc, an avalanche swept
                    away the whole party· Some of them extricated themselves; but three guides were
                    driven into a crevice and perished. On the 22d August 1822 Mr Clissold, who has
                    published an account of his journey, reached the summit. On the 4th September
                    1823 Mr Jackson arrived on the summit and descended the same day to Chamouny,
                    being, it is understood, the first who ever accomplished this arduous task m so
                    short a time, having been absent only thirty-six hours and a half from Chamouny;
                    but he remained on the summit only <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037128"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-7128-0563"/>three or four minutes. On the 26th August 1825 Dr
                    E. Clarke and Captain M. Sherwill made the ascent, employing three days, in the
                    expedition. On the 25th July 1827 Μ. C. Fcllowes and Μ. H. Hawes gained the
                    summit, having discovered a new route. Their journey occupied nearly three days.
                    On the 9th of August the summit was attained by Mr Auldjo of Cambridge, who has
                    published a highly interesting account of his journey. He says, “My ascent to
                    the Grand Mulets was on the 8th, and thence to the summit on the following day,
                    pursuing the route discovered in July. I remained on the summit one hour, and
                    descended to Chamounythe same day, being absent thirty-seven hours.” There have,
                    therefore, been fourteen successful ascents, says Mr Auldjo; and, not including
                    guides, eighteen persons have gained this great height. The majority of these
                    are Englishmen, ten being their number. Of the rest, two are Americans, two
                    Swiss, one Russian, one German, and one Savoyard. It is remarkable that no
                    Frenchman has ever been on the summit. Some years ago a party of guides made the
                    ascent for pleasure, and Maria de Mont Blanc, a high-spirited girl, accompanied
                    them, being the only female who has ever reached the summit. Napoleon also
                    ordered a party of guides to ascend, and plant a cross on the summit, which was
                    done; but it was blown down in a day or two afterwards.</p>

                    valleys. Two thirds of the surface are useless for agricultural purposes. The
                    north wind, which generally prevails, renders the climate cold; and the snow
                    remains in some of the valleys eight months of the year. The principal river is
                    the Durance, which is extremely rapid, and commits great ravages by its
                    inundations. The superficies of this department is about 1,084,614 square acres,
                    and its population 121,500. It is divided into three communal districts. Embrun
                    is the principal town.</p>
