                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">AESOP</label>, the Phrygian, lived in the time of Solon,
                    about the 50th Olympiad, under the reign of Croesus, the last king of Lydia. As
                    to genius and abilities, he was greatly indebted to nature; but in other
                    respects not so fortunate, being born a slave and extremely deformed. St Jerome,
                    speaking of him, says he was unfortunate in his birth, condition in life, and
                    death; hinting thereby at his deformity, servile state, and tragical end. His
                    great genius, however, enabled him to support his misfortunes; and in order to
                    alleviate the hardships of servitude, he composed those entertaining and
                    instructive fables which have acquired him so much reputation. He is generally
                    supposed to have been the inventor of that kind of writing; but this is
                    contested by several, particularly Quintilian, who seems to think that Hesiod
                    was the first author of fables. Aesop, however, certainly improved this art to a
                    very great degree; and hence it is that he has been accounted the author of this
                    sort of productions:</p>

                <p>The first master whom Aesop served was one Carasius Demarchus, an inhabitant of
                    Athens; and there, in all probability, he acquired his purity in the Greek
                    tongue. After him he had several masters, and at length came under a philosopher
                    named Idmon or Iadmon, who enfranchised him. After he had recovered his liberty,
                    he soon acquired a great reputation amongst the Greeks; so that, according to
                    Meziriac, the report of his wisdom having reached Croesus, he sent to inquire
                    after him, and engaged him in his service. He travelled through Greece,
                    according to the same author, whether for his own pleasure or upon the affairs
                    of Croesus is uncertain; and passing by Athens soon after Pisistratus had
                    usurped the sovereign power, and finding that the Athenians bore the yoke very
                    impatiently, he told them the fable of the frogs who petitioned Jupiter for a
                    king. The images made use of by Aesop are certainly very happy inventions to
                    instruct mankind: they possess all that is necessary to perfect a precept,
                    having a mixture of the useful with the agreeable. “Aesop the fabulist,” says
                    Aulus Gellius, “was deservedly esteemed wise, since he did not, after the manner
                    of the philosophers, rigidly and imperiously dictate such things as were proper
                    to be advised and persuaded; but framing entertaining and agreeable apologues,
                    he thereby charms and captivates the human mind.” Aesop was put to death at
                    Delphi. Plutarch tells us, that he came thither with a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193032383" xml:id="kp-eb0702-2383-0198"/>great quantity of gold and
                    silver, being ordered by Croesus to offer a sacrifice to Apollo, and to give a
                    considerable sum to each inhabitant; but a quarrel arising betwixt him and the
                    Delphians, he sent back the money to Croesus; for he thought those for whom the
                    prince designed it had rendered themselves unworthy of it. The inhabitants of
                    Delphi brought an accusation of sacrilege against him; and pretending they had
                    convicted him, threw him headlong from a rock. For this cruelty and injustice,
                    we are told, they were visited with famine and pestilence; and consulting the
                    oracle, they received for answer, that the god designed this as a punishment for
                    their treatment of Aesop. They endeavoured to make an atonement, by raising a
                    pyramid to his honour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Aesop,</hi><hi rend="italic">Clodius,</hi> a celebrated
                    actor, who flourished about the 670th year of Rome. He and Roscius were
                    contemporaries, and the best performers who ever appeared upon the Roman stage;
                    the former excelling in tragedy, the latter in comedy. Cicero put himself under
                    their direction, to perfect his action. Aesop lived in a most expensive manner,
                    and at one entertainment is said to have had a dish which cost above L.800. This
                    dish, we are told, was filled with singing and speaking birds, some of which
                    cost near L.50. The delight which Aesop took in this sort of birds proceeded, as
                    M. Bayle observes, from the expense. He did not make a dish of them because they
                    could speak, according to the refinement of Pliny upon this circumstance, this
                    motive being only by accident, but because of their extraordinary price. If
                    there had been any birds that could not speak, and yet more scarce and dear than
                    these, he would have procured such for his table. Aesop’s son was no less
                    luxurious than his father, for he dissolved pearls for his guests to swallow.
                    Some speak of this as a common practice of his; but others mention his falling
                    into this excess only on a particular day, when he was treating his friends.
                    Horace<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sat.</hi> iii. lib. ii. 239.</p></note> speaks only of one pearl of great
                    value, which he dissolved in vinegar and drank. When he was upon the stage, he
                    entered into his part to such a degree as sometimes to be seized with a perfect
                    ecstasy. Plutarch mentions it as reported of him, that whilst he was
                    representing Atreus deliberating how he should revenge himself on Thyestes, he
                    was so transported beyond himself in the heat of action, that with his truncheon
                    he smote one of the servants crossing the stage, and laid him dead on the
                    spot.</p>
