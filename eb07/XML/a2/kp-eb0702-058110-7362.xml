                <p><label type="entry">AMADEUS V.</label> count of Savoy, rose to that dignity in
                    the year 1285. In him it appeared that mental excellence can rise superior to
                    riches or extent of territory; for although his dominions were by no <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> means extensive, nor his riches great, yet, in
                    consequence of his wisdom and success, he obtained the surname of <hi
                    rend="italic">Great.</hi> The cautious prudence of Amadeus, however, enabled him
                    greatly to increase his territory by means of marriage, purchase, and donations.
                    In this situation, with extended dominion, and distinguished for wisdom and
                    prudence, he rose to such eminence among the European powers, that he was
                    constituted their umpire to settle their differences; which office he performed
                    with much reputation to himself and advantage to them. In his character valour
                    and wisdom were combined; for when the Turks attempted to retake the isle of
                    Rhodes from the knights of St John of Jerusalem, he acquired great renown by the
                    valour with which he defended it. A Maltese cross with the letters F. E. R. T.
                    in future became the arms of Amadeus and his successors, in memory of this
                    signal victory. The explanation of this motto is said to be, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit,</hi> his valour preserved Rhodes. For this
                    important service the grand-master conferred on him the grant of a palace at
                    Lyons. Andronicus, the emperor of the East, had married his daughter; and in
                    order to promote the views of his son-in-law, Amadeus took a journey to Avignon,
                    to persuade Pope John XXII. to preach a crusade in favour of Andronicus. He died
                    there in the year 1323. Deep penetration, keen discernment, consummate prudence,
                    great valour, together with no small portion of the religious superstition of
                    his time, appear the most striking features in his character.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> VIII; count of Savoy, succeeded his father
                    Amadeus VII. in 1391. With the large sum of 45,000 florins of gold he purchased
                    the country of Genevois from its last earl. Anxious to extend his territories,
                    he purchased the city of Rumilli, upon the lake of Geneva, from the widow of the
                    count of Genevois; and thus the house of Savoy became so powerful, that the
                    emperor Sigismund erected Savoy into a duchy in the year 1426. Historians relate
                    that he assisted John Paleologus against the duke of Milan, who endeavoured to
                    wrest from him the duchy of Montferrat. Deeply sensible of the services which he
                    had received, Paleologus not only resigned to the duke, Chivas, Brandis, and
                    several other estates, but submitted to hold all the marquisate of Montferrat as
                    a fief from the house of Savoy. Thèse fortunate acquisitions of territory were
                    not yet limited; for upon the marriage of his daughter with Philip Maria, duke
                    of Milan, he received Vercelli; and about the same time the count of Crescentino
                    submitted to become his feodary. In his ambitious pursuit he laid claim to the
                    sovereignty of the city of Geneva; but that claim, though enforced by the pope,
                    was rejected by the citizens with disdain; and the emperor Sigismund, taking it
                    under his protection, declared it an imperial city. After such an extensive
                    acquisition of dominion, and amassing such sums of money, he formed the singular
                    scheme of abandoning his throne and family; and for that purpose retired to a
                    religious house at a place called <hi rend="italic">Pipaille.</hi> But although
                    he resigned the dukedom of Savoy to his eldest son Lewis, and made his youngest
                    son Philip count of Genevois, yet their honours were merely nominal; for he
                    constrained them to live on a very scanty allowance, while he in his retirement
                    received all the revenues, and collected such sums of money, that he is said to
                    have purchased the papal honours. During the previous part of his life, having
                    assumed great sanctity of manners, the motives for his retirement were generally
                    reckoned religious; but what was the astonishment of mankind to behold the seat
                    of his hermitage become the scene of voluptuous pleasure and the most refined
                    luxury! The local situation of the place was truly delightful, and it was
                    enriched with every thing that could afford gratification to the senses; his
                    retinue consisted of some of his most intimate friends, along with twenty
                    faithful servants, who were the guardians of his voluptuous secrets. Instead of
                    a religious habit, he wore purple robes; and upon his mantle was embroidered a
                    golden cross. His table groaned under a weight of dainties, and the softest
                    music cheered his daily feast: in short, such was the luxury of the place, that
                    in the French language the phrase <hi rend="italic">faire ripaille</hi>
                    signifies to make exquisitely good cheer.</p>
                <p>He instituted a secular knighthood in that place, under the appellation of St
                    Maurice. The brethren assumed the name of hermits, wore beards, and excluded
                    women from their community; and in other respects exhibited the character of
                    decent epicures.</p>
                <p>When he obtained the papal dignity, and was crowned <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193037375" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7375-0582"/>by the cardinal of Arles at
                    Basil, all Europe was filled with astonishment in consequence of his elevation;
                    for he had never entered into holy orders. But he had found means to remove
                    every objection, the council confirmed his election, and with pretended
                    reluctance he put on the pontifical ornaments, and was consecrated in the church
                    of St Maurice, under the title of Felix V. The papal dignity was severely
                    contested between him and Euge-nius; and, notwithstanding all the importunities
                    of the council, the emperor refused to acknowledge his elevation. This religious
                    dispute involved all Europe in contention. Historians relate that Germany
                    remained neutral, while France, England, Italy, Spain, and Hungary, declared for
                    Eugenius; but Arragon, Poland, and Bretagne, recognised the council only; at the
                    same time that Savoy, Switzerland, Basil, Strasburg, Pomerania, and one of the
                    duchies of Bavaria, recognised Felix. The emperor Frederick III. held a council
                    at Frankfort, before which both the popes urged their respective rights by means
                    of deputies. This attempt; however, to establish peace in Europe proving
                    unsuccessful, the emperor repaired to the vicinity of Basil, and had a personal
                    interview with Felix. Amadeus, that he might the more freely indulge his sensual
                    appetite, again repaired to his favourite retreat; and after the fathers of the
                    council had frequently solicited him in vain to reside at Basil, he prevailed
                    upon them to remove to Lyons, which was near the seat of his pleasures. During
                    the contest Eugenius had excommunicated Felix, the council, and several of the
                    German princes, so that the whole church was then filled with confusion and
                    disorder. The struggle, however, was terminated by the death of Eugenius, when
                    the cardinals at Rome elected Thomas de Sarzan, who assumed the name of Nicholas
                    V. In this state of affairs Amadeus deemed it prudent to enter into a
                    negotiation for the resignation of his papal crown; and such was the policy and
                    address displayed by him in this transaction, that Nicholas was induced to annul
                    all that Eugenius had done to his dishonour, or that of his associates; to
                    confirm the determination of the council of Basil to appoint him perpetual
                    apostolical legate in Savoy, Piedmont, and the other places of his own
                    dominions; and even added to these the honour of being bishop of Basil,
                    Lausanne, Strasburg, and Constance. Nor did his vanity forsake him even in this
                    political transaction, for he provided that he should continue to wear the
                    pontifical dress, unless in a very few particulars. In order to gratify the same
                    haughty disposition, he stipulated that he should not be obliged to go to Rome
                    to attend any general council; and that when he had occasion to approach the
                    pope, he should rise to receive him, and instead of kissing his toe, he should
                    be permitted to kiss his cheek. Amadeus retired to Lausanne, and died there at
                    the age of 60, in the year 1451.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeüs</hi> IX. count of Savoy, succeeded his father Lewis,
                    in his dominion and honours. His bodily constitution was weak, and he was
                    afflicted with the fallingsickness; yet, on account of his piety, virtue,
                    benevolence, and justice, he was surnamed the <hi rend="italic">Happy.</hi> The
                    clemency of his temper was such that he readily pardoned those who offended him,
                    and in few instances was he induced to punish. In his character the virtue of
                    benevolence shone with peculiar splendour among the other virtues of the
                    Christian. In 1472, in the seventh year of his reign, and the thirty-seventh of
                    his life, he died universally lamented by all his loyal subjects.</p>
