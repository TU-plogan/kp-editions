                    by Athenaeus called <hi rend="italic">'Houση,</hi> a city of Lower Egypt, and
                    for a long time its capital. This city was built by Alexander the Great, soon
                    after the overthrow of Tyre, about 333 years before Christ. It is situated on
                    the Mediterranean, twelve miles west of that mouth of the Nile anciently called
                    <hi rend="italic">Canopicum,</hi> and lies in long. 29. 54. E. lat. 31. 10.
                    N.</p>
                <p>Alexander is said to have been induced to build this city on account of its
                    affording a fine port, and being advantageously situated for trade. It realized
                    his expectations; for it soon became the emporium, not only for merchandise, but
                    also for all the arts and sciences of the Greeks. Alexandria, according to
                    Strabo, was 30 stadia in length from east to west, and 7 or 8 stadia in breadth
                    where narrowest. The circumference was about 70 stadia, or 9 miles; but Pliny,
                    including no doubt the suburbs, reckons the circumference 15 miles. Lake
                    Mareotis bathed its walls on the south, and the Mediterranean on the north. It
                    was intersected lengthwise by straight parallel streets. This direction left a
                    free passage to the northern wind, which alone conveys coolness and salubrity
                    into Egypt. A street of 2000 feet wide began at the gate of the sea, and
                    terminated at the gate of Canopus. It was decorated with magnificent houses,
                    temples, and public buildings. In its extensive range, the eye was never tired
                    with admiring the marble, the porphyry, and obelisks, which were destined at
                    some future day to embellish Rome and Constantinople. The great street, the
                    handsomest in the world, was intersected by another of the same breadth, which
                    formed a square at their junction of half a league in circumference. From the
                    middle of this great place the two gates were to be seen at once, and vessels
                    arriving under full sail from the north and from the south.</p>
                <p>A neck of land a mile in length (not an artificial mole, as some imagine)
                    stretched from the continent to the isle of Pharos, and divided the great
                    harbour into two. That which is to the northward preserved its name. A dike
                    drawn from the island to the rock whereon was built the</p>
                <p>Pharos secured it from the westerly winds. The other was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eunostos,</hi> or the Safe Return. The former is called at present the new, the
                    latter the old harbour: a bridge that joins the mole to the city served for a
                    communication between them. It was raised on lofty pillars sunk into the sea,
                    and left a free passage for ships. The palace, which advanced beyond the
                    promontory of <hi rend="italic">Lochias,</hi> extended as far as the dike, and
                    occupied more than a quarter of the city. Each of the Ptolemies added to its
                    magnificence. It contained within its inclosure, the museum, an asylum for
                    learned men, groves, and buildings worthy of royal majesty, and a temple where
                    the body of Alexander was deposited in a golden coffin. The infamous Seleucus
                    Cibyofactes violated this monument, carried off the golden coffin, and put a
                    glass one in its place. In the great harbour was the little island of
                    Anti-Rhodes, where stood a theatre and a royal place of residence. Within the
                    harbour of Eunostos was a smaller one called <hi rend="italic">Kibotos,</hi> dug
                    by the hand of man, which communicated with Lake Mareotis by a canal. Between
                    this canal and the palace was the admirable temple of Serapis, and that of
                    Neptune near the great place where the market was held. Alexandria extended
                    likewise along the northern banks of the lake. Its eastern part presented to
                    view the gymnasium, with its porticos of more than 600 feet long, supported by
                    several rows of marble pillars. Without the gate of Canopus was a spacious
                    circus for the chariot races. Beyond that the suburb of Nicoolis ran along the
                    sea-shore, and seemed a second Alexandria. A superb amphitheatre was built
                    there, with a race-ground, for the celebration of the quinquennalia.</p>
                <p>Such is the description left us of Alexandria by the ancients, and above all by
                    Strabo.</p>
                <p>The architect employed by Alexander in this undertaking was the celebrated
                    Dinocrates, who had acquired so much reputation by rebuilding the temple of
                    Diana at Ephesus. The city was first rendered populous by Ptolemy Soter, one of
                    Alexander’s captains, who, after the death of the Macedonian monarch, being
                    appointed governor of Egypt, soon assumed the title of king, and took up his
                    residence at Alexandria, about 304 years before Christ.</p>
                <p>In the 30th year of Ptolemy Soter’s reign, he took his son Ptolemy Philadelphus
                    partner with him in the empire; and by this prince the city of Alexandria was
                    much embellished. In the first year of his reign the famous watch-tower of
                    Pharos was finished. It had been begun several years before by Ptolemy Soter;
                    and, when finished, was looked upon as one of the wonders of the world. The same
                    year, the islet of Pharos itself, originally seven furlongs distant from the
                    peninsula, was joined to it by a causeway. This Was the work of Dexiphanes, who
                    completed it at the same time that his son put the last hand to the tower. The
                    tower was a large square structure of white marble, on the top of which fires
                    were kept constantly burning, for the direction of sailors. The building cost
                    800 talents; which, if Attic, amounted to L. 165,000; if Alexandrian, to twice
                    that sum.</p>
                <p>The architect employed in this famous structure fell upon the following
                    contrivance to usurp the whole glory to himself. Being ordered to engrave upon
                    it the following inscription,—“King <hi rend="smallcaps">Ptolemy</hi> to the
                    Gods the Saviours, for the benefit of Sailors,”—instead of the king’s name he
                    substituted his own, and then filling up the hollow of the marble with mortar,
                    wrote upon it the above-mentioned inscription. In process of time, the mortar
                    being worn off, the following inscription appeared: “Sos- <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >tratus</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cnidian,</hi> the son of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dexiphanes,</hi> to the Gods the Saviours, for the benefit of
                    Sailors.”</p>
                <p>This year also was remarkable for the bringing of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193035139" xml:id="kp-eb0702-5139-0410"/>image of Serapis from Pontus
                    to Alexandria. It was set up in one of the suburbs of the city, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhacotis,</hi> where a temple was afterwards erected to his
                    honour, suitable to the greatness of that stately metropolis, and called, from
                    the god worshipped there, <hi rend="italic">Serapeum.</hi> This structure,
                    according to Ammianus Marcellinus, surpassed in beauty and magnificence all
                    others in the world, except the Capitol at Rome. Within the verge of this temple
                    was the famous Alexandrian library. It was founded by Ptolemy Soter, for the use
                    of an academy he instituted in this city; and, by continual additions by his
                    successors, became at last the finest library in the world, containing no fewer
                    than 700,000 volumes. The method followed in collecting books for this library
                    was to seize all those which were brought into Egypt by Greeks or other
                    foreigners. The books were transcribed in the museum by persons appointed for
                    that purpose: the copies were then delivered to the proprietors, .and the
                    originals laid up in the library. Ptolemy Euergetes, having borrowed from the
                    Athenians the works of Sophocles, Euripides, and Aeschylus, returned them only
                    the copies, which he caused to be transcribed in as beautiful a manner as
                    possible; presenting the Athenians at the same time with fifteen talents
                    (upwards of L.30,000 sterling) for the exchange.</p>
                <p>As the museum was at first in that quarter of the city called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pruxhion,</hi> near the royal palace, the library was placed there likewise;
                    but when it came to contain 400,000 volumes, another library, within the
                    Serapeum, was erected by way of supplement to it, and on that account called the
                    <hi rend="italic">daughter</hi> of the former. In this second library 300,000
                    volumes, in process of time, were deposited; and the two together contained the
                    700,000 volumes already mentioned. In the war carried on by Julius Caesar
                    against the inhabitants of this city, the library in the Bruchion, with the
                    400,000 volumes it contained, was reduced to ashes. The library in the Serapeum,
                    however, still remained; and here Cleopatra deposited 200,000 volumes of the
                    Pergamean library, which Mark Antony presented her with. These, and others added
                    from time to time, rendered the new library at Alexandria more numerous and
                    considerable than the former; and though it was often plundered during the
                    revolutions and troubles of the Roman empire, yet it was again and again
                    repaired, and filled with the same number of books. For 293 years, Alexandria
                    was held in subjection by the Ptolemies.</p>
                <p>This city, as we have already observed, soon became extremely populous, and was
                    embellished both by its own princes and the Romans; but, like most other noted
                    cities of antiquity, it has been the seat of terrible massacres. About 141 years
                    before Christ it was almost totally depopulated by Ptolemy Physcon. That
                    barbarous monster, without the least provocation, gave free liberty to his
                    guards to plunder his metropolis, and murder the inhabitants at their pleasure.
                    The cruelties practised on this occasion cannot be expressed, and the few who
                    escaped were so terrified that they fled into other countries. Upon this,
                    Physcon, that he might not reign over empty houses, invited thither strangers
                    from the neighbouring countries; by whom the city-was repeopled, and soon
                    recovered its former splendour. On this occasion many learned men, having been
                    obliged to fly, proved the means of reviving learning in Greece, Asia Minor, and
                    the islands of the Arehipelago and other places, where it was almost totally
                    lost.</p>
                <p>The new inhabitants were not treated with much more kindness by Physcon than the
                    old ones had been; for, on their complaining of his tyrannical behaviour, he
                    resolved on a general massacre of the young men. Accordingly, when they were one
                    day assembled in the gymnasium, or place of their public exercises, he ordered
                    it to be set on fire; so that they all perished, either in the flames, or by the
                    swords of his mercenaries, whom the tyrant had placed at all the avenues.</p>
                <p>Though Julius Caesar was obliged to carry on a war for some time against this
                    city, it seems not to have suffered much damage, except the burning of the
                    library already mentioned. Before Caesar left Alexandria, in acknowledgement of
                    the assistance he had received from the Jews, he confirmed all their privileges
                    there, and even engraved his decree on a pillar of brass. This, however, did not
                    prevent the massacre of 50,000 of them in this city, about the year of Christ
                    67.</p>
                <p>The city of Alexandria seems to have fallen into decay soon after this, and to
                    have forfeited many of its ancient privileges, though for what offence is not
                    known; but when Adrian visited Egypt, about the year 141, it was almost totally
                    ruined. He repaired both the public and private buildings, not only restoring
                    the inhabitants to their ancient privileges, but heaping new favours upon them;
                    for which they returned him their solemn thanks, and conferred upon him what
                    honours they could while he was present; but as soon as he was gone, they
                    published the most virulent and bitter lampoons against him.</p>
                <p>The fickle and satirical humour of the Alexandrians was highly disliked by
                    Adrian, though he inflicted no punishment upon them for it; but when they
                    lampooned Caracalla, he did not let them escape so easily. That tyrant, in the
                    year 215, when he visited their city, having become the subject of their foolish
                    satires, ordered a general massacre by his numerous troops, who were dispersed
                    all over the city. The inhuman order being given, all were murdered, without
                    distinction of age or sex; so that in one night’s time the whole city floated in
                    blood, and every house was filled with carcasses. The monster who occasioned
                    this had retired during the night to the temple of Serapis, to implore the
                    protection of that deity; and, not yet satiated with slaughter, commanded the
                    massacre to be continued all the next day; so that very few of the inhabitants
                    remained. As if even this had not been sufficient, he stripped the city of all
                    its ancient privileges; suppressed the academy; ordered all strangers who lived
                    there to depart; and that the few who remained might not have the satisfaction
                    of seeing one another, he cut off all communication of one street with another,
                    by walls built for that purpose, and guarded by troops left there.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this terrible disaster, Alexandria soon recovered its former
                    splendour, as Caracalla was murdered a short time after. It was long esteemed
                    the first city in the world, next to Rome; and we may judge of its magnificence,
                    and the multitude of people contained in it, from the account of Diodorus
                    Siculus, who relates, that in his time (44 years before Christ) Alexandria had
                    on its rolls 300,000 free inhabitants. Mannert, a learned German writer, thinks
                    the slaves must have been at least as numerous; and thus the city, in its
                    flourishing periods, had contained not less than 600,000 inhabitants. Towards
                    the middle of the sixth century, Amrou Ebn al Aas, Omar’s general, took it by
                    storm, after a siege of 14 months, and with the loss of 23,000 men. Heraclius,
                    then emperor of Constantinople, did not send a single ship to its assistance.
                    This prince affords an example very rare in history: he had displayed some
                    vigour in the first year of his reign, and then suffered himself to be lulled
                    into idleness and effeminacy. Awakened suddenly from his lethargy by the noise
                    of the conquests of Cosroes, that scourge of the East, he put himself at the
                    head of his armies, distinguished himself as a great captain from his very first
                    campaign, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193035152" xml:id="kp-eb0702-5152-0411"/>laid
                    waste Persia for seven years, and returned to his capital covered with laurels:
                    he then became a theologian on the throne, lost all his energy, and amused
                    himself the rest of his life with disputing upon monotheism, whilst the Arabs
                    were robbing him of the finest provinces of the empire. Deaf to the cries of the
                    unfortunate inhabitants of Alexandria, as he had been to those of the people of
                    Jerusalem, who defended themselves for two years, he left them a sacrifice to
                    the rising fortune of the indefatigable Amrou. All their intrepid youth perished
                    with their arms in their hands.</p>
                <p>The victor, astonished at his conquest, wrote to the caliph, “I have taken the
                    city of the west. It is of an immense extent. I cannot describe to you how many
                    wonders it contains. There are 4000 palaces, 4000 baths, 12,000 dealers in fresh
                    oil, 12,000 gardeners, 40,000 Jews, who pay tribute, 400 theatres or places of
                    amusement.”</p>
                <p>At this time, according to the Arabian historians, Alexandria consisted of three
                    cities, viz. <hi rend="italic">Menna,</hi> or the port, which included Pharos
                    and the neighbouring parts; <hi rend="italic">Alexandria,</hi> properly so
                    called, where the modern Scan-deria now stands; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nekita,</hi> probably the Necropolis of Josephus and Strabo.</p>
                <p>At that time John, surnamed <hi rend="italic">the Grammarian,</hi> a famous
                    Peripatetic philosopher, being in the city, and in high favour with Amrou Ebn al
                    Aas, the Saracen general, begged of him the royal library. Amrou replied that it
                    was not in his power to grant such a request; but that he would write to the
                    caliph on that head, since, without knowing his pleasure, he dared not to
                    dispose of a single book. He accordingly wrote to Omar, who was then caliph,
                    acquainting him with the request of his friend; to which the ignorant tyrant
                    replied, That if those books contained the same doctrine with the Koran, they
                    could be of no use, since the Koran contained all necessary truths; but if they
                    contained any thing contrary to that book, they ought not to be suffered; and,
                    therefore, whatever their contents were, he ordered them to be destroyed.
                    Pursuant to this order, they were distributed among the public baths, where, for
                    the space of six months, they served to supply the fires of those places, of
                    which there was an incredible number in Alexandria.</p>
                <p>After the city was taken, Amrou thought proper to pursue the Greeks who had fled
                    farther up the country; and therefore marched out of Alexandria, leaving but a
                    very slender garrison in the place. The Greeks, who had before fled on board
                    their ships, being apprized of this, returned on a sudden, surprised the town,
                    and put all the Arabs they found therein to the sword; but Amrou, receiving
                    advice of what had happened, suddenly returned, and drove them out of it with
                    great slaughter: after which the Greeks were so intimidated, that he had nothing
                    further to fear from them.—A few years after, however, Amrou being deprived of
                    his government by the caliph 0thman, the Egyptians were so much displeased with
                    his dismission, that they inclined to a revolt; and Constantine, the Greek
                    emperor, having received intelligence of their disaffection, began to meditate
                    the reduction of Alexandria. For this purpose he sent one Manuel, a eunuch, and
                    his general, with a powerful army, to retake that place; which, by the
                    assistance of the Greeks in the city, who kept a secret correspondence with the
                    imperial forces while at sea, and joined them as soon as they had made a
                    descent, he effected, without any considerable effusion of Christian blood. The
                    caliph, now perceiving his mistake, immediately restored Amrou to his former
                    dignity. This step was very agreeable to the natives, who, having had experience
                    of the military skill and bravery of this renowned general, and apprehending
                    that they should be called to an account by the Greeks for their former
                    perfidious conduct, had petitioned Oth-man to send him again into Egypt.—Upon
                    Amrou’s arrival, therefore, at Alexandria, the Copts or natives, with the
                    traitor Al-Mokawkas (who had formerly betrayed to Amrou the fortress of Mesr) at
                    their head, not only joined him, but supplied him with all kinds of provisions,
                    exciting him to attack the Greeks without delay. This he did; and, after a most
                    obstinate dispute, which lasted several days, drove them into the town, where,
                    for some time, they defended themselves with great bravery, and repelled the
                    utmost efforts of the besiegers. This so exasperated Amrou, that he swore, if
                    God enabled him to conquer the Greeks, he would throw down the walls of the
                    city, and make it as easy of access as the house of a prostitute. Nor did he
                    fail to execute his threat; for, having taken the town by storm, he quite
                    dismantled it, entirely demolishing the walls and fortifications. The lives of
                    the citizens, however, were spared, at least as far as lay in the general’s
                    power; but many of them were put to the sword by the soldiers on their first,
                    entrance. In one quarter particularly, Amrou found them butchering the
                    Alexandrians with unrelenting barbarity; to which, however, by his seasonable
                    interposition, he put a stop, and on that spot erected a mosque, which he called
                    the <hi rend="italic">mosque of mercy.</hi></p>
                <p>From this time Alexandria never recovered its former splendour. It continued
                    under the dominion of the caliphs till the year 924, when it was taken by the
                    Magre-bians, two years after its great church had been destroyed by fire. This
                    church was called by the Arabs <hi rend="italic">Al Kaisa-ria,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Caesarea,</hi> and had formerly been a pagan temple, erected in
                    honour of Saturn by the famous Queen Cleopatra.</p>
                <p>The city was soon after abandoned by the Magrebians; but in 928 they again made
                    themselves masters of it. Their fleet being afterwards defeated by that
                    belonging to the caliph, Abul Kâsem the Magrebian general retired from
                    Alexandria, leaving there only a garrison of 300 men; of which Thmaâl, the
                    caliph’s admiral, being apprized, he in a few days appeared before the town, and
                    carried off the remainder of the inhabitants to an island of the Nile called
                    Abukair. This was done to prevent Abul Kâsem from meeting with any entertainment
                    at Alexandria, in case he should think proper to return. According to Eutychius,
                    above 200,000 of the miserable inhabitants perished this year.</p>
                <p>What contributed to raise Alexandria to the extraordinary height of splendour it
                    enjoyed for a long time, was its being the centre of commerce between the
                    eastern and western parts of the world. It was with the view of becoming master
                    of this lucrative trade that Alexander, built this city, after having extirpated
                    the Tyrians, who formerly engrossed all the East India traffic. Of the immense
                    riches which that trade afforded, we may form an idea, from considering that the
                    Romans accounted it a point of policy to oppress the Egyptians, especially the
                    Alexandrians; and after the defeat of Zenobia, there was a single merchant of
                    Alexandria, who, it is said, undertook to raise and pay an army out of the
                    profits of his trade. The Greek emperors drew enormous tributes from Egypt, and
                    yet the caliphs found their subjects in such good circumstances that they were
                    able to screw up their revenues to 300,000,000 of crowns.</p>
                <p>Though the revolutions which happened in the government of Egypt after it fell
                    into the hands of the Mahometans frequently affected this city to a very great
                    degree, yet still the excellence of its port, and the innumerable conveniences
                    resulting from the East India trade, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193035165"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-5165-0412"/>to whomsoever were masters of Egypt, preserved it
                    from total destruction, even when in the hands of the most barbarous nations.
                    Thus, in the 13th century, when the European nations began to acquire a taste
                    for the elegancies of life, the old mart of Alexandria began to revive; and the
                    port, though far from recovering its former magnificence, grew once more famous
                    by becoming the centre of commerce: but having fallen under the dominion of the
                    Turks, and the passage round the Cape of Good Hope being discovered by the
                    Portuguese in 1499, a fatal blow was given to the Alexandrian commerce, and the
                    city thenceforward declined from its ancient greatness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alexandria,</hi><hi rend="italic">Modem.</hi> It now
                    presents little more than half-ruined houses and rubbish, with a few fragments
                    of those magnificent edifices by which it was once adorned. The estimates of its
                    population have fluctuated remarkably, varying between 5000 and 20,000. Mr
                    Madden, to whom we owe the most recent account <hi rend="italic">(Travels in
                    Turkey,</hi> 1829), states the number at 16,000, of whom 9000 are Arabs, 2000
                    Greeks, 2000 Franks (Europeans); the rest Jews, Copts, &amp;c. The commerce of
                    Alexandria is still extensive, as almost all the commodities imported into and
                    exported from Egypt pass through its port. Both the British and French nations
                    maintain consuls at Alexandria, and of the former nation there are nine
                    considerable mercantile houses established there. The ‘Jewish merchants are also
                    numerous and wealthy; for, though subject to heavier impositions, they carry on
                    their traffic with such economy, and have such a friendly understanding with the
                    collectors of the customs, that they generally undersell Europeans. The late
                    extensive exportation of cotton from Egypt has given an increased importance to
                    Alexandria, and a considerable stir has been created by the naval expeditions
                    equipped there by the pacha.</p>
                <p>The present city is a kind of peninsula situated between the two ports. That to
                    the westward was called by the ancients the <hi rend="italic">Portus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Eunostos,</hi> now the old port, and is by far the best; Turkish
                    vessels only are allowed to anchor there: the other, called the new port, is for
                    the Christians; at the extremity of one of the arms of which stood the famous
                    Pharos. The new port, the only harbour for Europeans, is clogged up with sand,
                    insomuch that in stormy weather ships are liable to bilge; and the bottom being
                    also rocky, the cables soon chafe and part; so that one vessel driving against a
                    second, and that against a third, they are perhaps all lost. Of this there was a
                    fatal instance many years ago, when 42 vessels were dashed to pieces on the mole
                    in a gale of wind from the north-west; and numbers have been since lost there at
                    different times. If it be asked in Europe, why do they not repair the new port?
                    the answer is, that in Turkey they destroy every thing, and repair nothing. The
                    old harbour will be destroyed likewise, as the ballast of vessels has been
                    continually thrown into it for the last 200 years. The spirit of the Turkish
                    government is to ruin the labours of past ages, and destroy the hopes of future
                    times, because ignorant despotism never considers tomorrow.</p>
                <p>The country round Alexandria is entirely destitute of water. This must be brought
                    from the Nile by the kalidj, or canal of 12 leagues, which conveys it thither
                    every year at the time of the inundation. It fills the vaults or reservoirs dug
                    under the ancient city, and this provision must serve till the next year. It is
                    evident, therefore, that were a foreign power to take possession, the canal
                    would be shut, and all supplies of water cut off. It is this canal alone which
                    connects Alexandria with Egypt; for, from its situation without the Delta, and
                    the nature of the soil, it really belongs to the deserts of Africa. Its environs
                    are sandy, flat, and sterile, without trees and without houses; where we meet
                    with nothing but the plant which yields the kali, and a row of palm-trees, which
                    follows the course of the kalid, or canal. The famous tower of Pharos has long
                    since been demolished, and a castle, called Farillon, built in its place. The
                    causeway which joined the island to the continent is broken down, and its place
                    supplied by a strong bridge of several arches.</p>
                <p>Some parts of the old walls of the city are yet standing, and present a fine
                    specimen of ancient masonry. They are flanked with large towers, about 200 paces
                    distant from each other, with small towers in the middle. Below are magnificent
                    casemates, which may serve for galleries to walk in. In the lower part of the
                    towers is a large square hall, the roof of which is supported by thick columns
                    of Thebaic stone. Above are several rooms, over which are platforms more than 20
                    paces square. The ancient reservoirs, vaulted with so much art, which extend
                    under the whole town, remain almost entire at the end of 2000 years.</p>
                <p>Of Caesar’s palace there remain only a few porphyry pillars, and the front, which
                    is almost entire, and very beautiful. The palace of Cleopatra was built upon the
                    walls facing the port, having a gallery on the outside, supported by several
                    fine columns. Not far from this palace are two obelisks, vulgarly called
                    Cleopatra’s Needles. They are of Thebaic stone, and covered with hieroglyphics.
                    One is overturned, broken, and lying under the sand; the other is on its
                    pedestal. These two obelisks, each of which is a single stone, are about 60 feet
                    high, by seven feet square at the base. Denon, who went to Egypt along with the
                    French army in 1798, supposed that these columns decorated the entrance of the
                    palace of the Ptolemies, the ruins of which still exist at no great distance
                    from the place of the obelisks. Towards the gate of Rosetta are five columns of
                    marble, on the place formerly occupied by the porticos of the gymnasium. The
                    rest of the colonnade, the design of which was discoverable 100 years ago by
                    Maillet, has since been destroyed by the barbarism of the Turks.</p>
                <p>But what most engages the attention of travellers is the pillar of Pompey, as it
                    is commonly called, situated at a quarter of a league from the southern gate. It
                    is composed of red granite. The capital, which is Corinthian, with palm leaves,
                    and not indented, is nine feet high. The shaft and the upper member of the base
                    are of one piece of nearly 90 feet long and nine in diameter. The base is a
                    square of about 15 feet on each side. This block of marble, 60 feet in
                    circumference, rests on two layers of stone bound together with lead; which,
                    however, has not prevented the Arabs from forcing out several of them, to search
                    for an imaginary treasure. The whole column has been said to be 117 feet high,
                    but the most recent and careful estimates do not make it exceed 95. It is
                    perfectly well polished, and only a little shivered on the eastern side. Nothing
                    can equal the majesty of this monument; seen from a distance, it overtops the
                    town, and serves as a signal for vessels. On a nearer approach, it produces an
                    astonishment mixed with awe. One can never be tired with admiring the beauty of
                    the capital, the length of the shaft, or the extraordinary simplicity of the
                    pedestal. This last has been somewhat damaged by the instruments of travellers,
                    who are curious to possess a relic of this antiquity. The column was considered
                    inaccessible, till it was scaled about half a century ago by the wild frolic of
                    a party of English sailors, who conceived the project, of emptying a bowl of
                    punch on the top of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193035178"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-5178-0413"/>this celebrated monument. Dexterously availing
                    themselves of the movements of a paper kite, they succeeded in fastening a rope
                    to the summit, by which they ascended, and performed this great achievement.
                    They discovered a foot and ancle, the only remnant of a gigantic statue which
                    had originally adorned it. It has since been rendered more accessible; and Mr
                    Madden mentions an English lady who breakfasted and wrote a letter from this
                    elevated position.</p>
                <p>Learned men and travellers have made many fruitless attempts to discover in
                    honour of what prince it was erected. The best informed have concluded that it
                    could not be in honour of Pompey, since neither Strabo nor Diodorus Siculus has
                    spoken of it. The Arabian Abul-feda, in his <hi rend="italic">Description of
                    Egypt,</hi> calls it <hi rend="italic">the Pillar of Severus.</hi> And history
                    informs us that this emperor visited the city of Alexandria. Denon, on this
                    subject, expresses himself as follows:—“After having observed that the column is
                    very chaste both in style and execution; that the pedestal and capital are not
                    formed of the same granite as the shaft; that their workmanship is heavy, and
                    appears to be merely a rough draught; and that the foundations, made up of
                    fragments, indicate a modern construction ÿ—it may be concluded that this
                    monument is not antique, and that it may have been erected, either in the time
                    of the Greek emperors or of the caliphs; since, if the capital and pedestal are
                    of sufficiently good workmanship to belong to the former of these periods, they
                    are not so perfect but that art may have reached so far in the latter.”</p>
                <p>On the south-west side of the city, at a mile’s distance, are situated the
                    catacombs, the ancient burial-place of Alexandria; a remarkable object, although
                    they cannot be compared to those of the ancient Thebes. The Baron de Tott, in
                    describing these, observes “that Nature not having furnished this part of Egypt
                    with a ridge of rocks, like that which runs parallel with the Nile above Delta,
                    the ancient inhabitants of Alexandria could only have an imitation by digging
                    into a bed of solid rock; and thus they formed a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Necropolis,</hi> or City of the Dead. The excavation is from 30 to 40 feet
                    wide, 200 long, and 25 deep, and is terminated by gentle declivities at each
                    end. The two sides, cut perpendicularly, contain several openings, about 10 or
                    12 feet in width and height, hollowed horizontally; and which form, by their
                    different branches, subterranean streets. One of these, which curiosity has
                    disencumbered from the ruins and sands that render the entrance of others
                    difficult or impossible, contains no mummies, but only the places they occupied.
                    The order in which they were ranged is still to be seen. Niches, 20 inches
                    square, sunk six feet horizontally, narrowed at the bottom, and separated from
                    each other by partitions in the rock seven or eight inches thick, divided into
                    checkers the two walls of this subterranean vault It is natural to suppose, from
                    this disposition, that each mummy was introduced with the feet foremost into the
                    cell intended for its reception; and that new streets were opened, in proportion
                    as these dead inhabitants of Necropolis increased.” This observation, he adds,
                    which throws a light on the catacombs of Memphis, may perhaps likewise explain
                    the vast size and multitude, as well as the different elevations, of the
                    pyramids in Upper and Lower Egypt.</p>
                <p>About 70 paces from Pompey’s pillar is the khalis, or the canal of the Nile,
                    which was dug by the ancient Egyptians, to convey the water of the Nile to
                    Alexandria, and fill the cisterns under the city. This canal had ceased
                    altogether to be navigable, till Mahmood, the present pacha, spent immense
                    labour and cost in restoring it. Unfortunately, the Italian engineers whom he
                    employed were entirely destitute of the skill necessary to conduct so great and
                    arduous an undertaking. They took no measures to protect the canal against the
                    fresh influx of mud from the Nile, which accordingly has again choked it up to
                    so great an extent, that it can scarcely be navigated, unless during the season
                    of inundation.</p>
                <p>Alexandria, in modern times, has never ranked as a fortress, and is considered by
                    Volney as incapable of any defence. Accordingly, when attacked by Buonaparte in
                    1798, it surrendered without a blow. The French were very industrious in forming
                    the place, if not into a regular fortress, yet into a very strong entrenched
                    position. They appear to have succeeded. In 1801 Sir Ralph Abercromby undertook
                    his memorable expedition. On the 13th and 21st March he gained, in the plain
                    before Alexandria, two successive victories, of which the last was most complete
                    and signal, though purchased by the life of the distinguished commander. Yet it
                    was still not considered possible to carry Alexandria, unless by regular siege;
                    the conclusion of which, on the 2d September, was accompanied by a general
                    convention for the evacuation of Egypt by the French armies.</p>
                <p>In 1806 a British force under General Frazer landed and took possession of
                    Alexandria without resistance; but being repulsed in two successive attempts
                    upon Rosetta, they finally evacuated it on the 21st June 1807.</p>
