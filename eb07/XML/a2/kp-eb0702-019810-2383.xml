                <p><label type="entry">AETHER</label> is usually understood of a thin, subtile
                    matter or medium, much finer and rarer than air, which, commencing from the
                    limits of our atmosphere, possesses the whole heavenly space. The word is Greek,
                    <hi rend="italic">αι6ηξ,</hi> supposed to be formed from the verb <hi
                    rend="italic">αι6ειv, to burn, to flame;</hi> some of the ancients, particularly
                    Anaxagoras, supposing it to be of the nature of fire.</p>
                <p>The philosophers cannot conceive that the largest part of the creation should be
                    perfectly void; and therefore they fill it with a species of matter under the
                    denomination of <hi rend="italic">aether.</hi> But they vary extremely as to the
                    nature and character of this aether. Some conceive it as a body <hi
                    rend="italic">sui generis,</hi> appointed only to fill up the vacuities between
                    the heavenly bodies, and therefore confined to the regions above our atmosphere.
                    Others suppose it of so subtile and penetrating a nature as to pervade the air
                    and other bodies, and to possess the pores and intervals thereof. Others deny
                    the existence of any such specific matter, and think the air itself, by that
                    immense tenuity and expansion it is found capable of, may diffuse itself through
                    the interstellar spaces, and be the only matter found therein.</p>
                <p>In effect, aether being no object of our sense, but the mere work of imagination,
                    brought only upon the stage for the sake of hypothesis, or to solve some
                    phenomenon real or imaginary, authors take the liberty of modifying it as they
                    please. Some suppose it of an elementary nature, like other bodies, and only
                    distinguished by its tenuity, and the other affections consequent thereon; which
                    is the philosophical aether. Others will have it of another species, and not
                    elementary, but rather a sort of fifth element, of a purer, more refined, and
                    spiritous nature, than the substances about our earth, and void of the common
                    affections thereof, as gravity, &amp;c. The heavenly spaces being the supposed
                    region or residence of a more exalted class of beings, the medium must be more
                    exalted in proportion. Such is the ancient and popular idea of aether, or
                    aethereal· matter.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">aether</hi> being thus embarrassed with a variety of
                    ideas, and arbitrarily applied to so many different things, the later and
                    severer philosophers choose to set it aside, and in lieu thereof substitute
                    other more determinate ones. Thus, the Cartesians use the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >materia</hi><hi rend="italic">subtilis,</hi> which is their aether: and Sir
                    Isaac Newton, sometimes a <hi rend="italic">subtile spirit,</hi> as in the close
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Principia;</hi> and sometimes a <hi rend="italic"
                    >subtile</hi> or <hi rend="italic">aethereal medium,</hi> as in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Optics.</hi></p>
                <p>Heat, Sir Isaac Newton observes, is communicated through a vacuum almost as
                    readily as through air; but such communication cannot be without some
                    interjacent body, to act as a medium. And such body maybe subtile enough to
                    penetrate the pores of glass, and may permeate those of all other bodies, and
                    consequently be diffused through all the parts of space.</p>
                <p>The existence of such an aethereal medium being settled, that author proceeds to
                    its properties; inferring it to be not only rarer and more fluid than air, but
                    exceedingly more elastic and active; in virtue of which properties he shows,
                    that a great part of the phenomena of nature may be produced by it. To the
                    weight, <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> of this medium, he attributes gravitation,
                    or the weight of all other bodies; and to its elasticity, the elastic force of
                    the air and of nervous fibres, and the emission, refraction, reflection, and
                    other phenomena of light; as also sensation, muscular <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193032396" xml:id="kp-eb0702-2396-0199"/>motion, &amp;c. In fine, this
                    same matter seems the <hi rend="italic">primum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mobile,</hi> the first source or spring of physical action in the modem
                    system.</p>
                <p>The Cartesian aether is supposed not only to pervade, but adequately to fill, all
                    the vacuities of bodies; and thus to make an absolute plenum in the
                    universe.</p>
                <p>But Sir Isaac Newton shows that the celestial spaces are void of all sensible
                    resistance; and hence it follows, that the matter contained therein must be
                    immensely rare, in regard the resistance of bodies is chiefly as their density:
                    so that if the heavens were thus adequately filled with a medium or matter, how
                    subtile soever, they would resist the motion of the planets and comets much more
                    than quicksilver or gold. But it has been supposed that what Newton has said of
                    aether is to be considered only as a conjecture, and especially as no new proofs
                    of its existence have been adduced since his time.</p>
                <p>The late discoveries in electricity have thrown great light upon this subject,
                    and rendered it extremely probable that the aether so often talked of is no
                    other than the electric fluid, or solar light, which diffuses itself throughout
                    the whole system of nature.</p>
