                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">AMALEK</label>, the son of Eliphaz, by Timna his concubine,
                    and the grandson of Esau. (Gen. xxxvi. 12, and 1 Chr. i. 36.) Amalek succeeded
                    Gatam in the government of Edom. He was the father of the Amalekites, a powerful
                    people who dwelt in Arabia Petraea, between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, or
                    between Havila and Shur (1 Sam. xv. 7), sometimes in one canton and sometimes in
                    another. It does not appear that they had cities, for there is no mention of any
                    but one in the Scriptures (1 Sam. XV. 5): they lived generally in hamlets,
                    caves, or tents.</p>
                <p>The Israelites had scarcely passed the Red Sea on their way to the wilderness,
                    before the Amalekites came to attack them in the deserts of Rephidim (Exod.
                    xvii. 8, &amp;c.), and cruelly put to the sword those who were obliged either
                    through fatigue or weakness to remain behind. Moses, by divine command, directed
                    Joshua to fall upon this people,—to record in a book the act of inhumanity which
                    they had committed, in order to have it always before their eyes,—and to revenge
                    it in the most remarkable manner. Joshua therefore fell upon the Amalekites and
                    defeated them, while Moses was upon the mountain, with Aaron and Hur in company.
                    Moses, during the time of the engagement, held up his hands, to which the
                    success of the battle was owing; for as often as he let them down, Amalek
                    prevailed. But Moses’ hands being tired, Aaron and Hur supported his arms, and
                    held them extended while the battle lasted, which was from the morning till the
                    approach of night, when the Amalekites were cut in pieces. This happened in the
                    year of the world 2513, before Christ 1491.</p>
                <p>The ground of the enmity of the Amalekites against the Israelites is generally
                    supposed to have been an innate hatred, from the remembrance of Jacob’s
                    depriving their <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037401" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7401-0584"
                    />progenitor both of his birthright and blessing. Their falling upon them,
                    however, and that without any provocation, when they saw them reduced to so low
                    a condition by the fatigue of their march and an excessive drought, was an
                    inhuman action, and justly deserved the severe punishment inflicted on them by
                    Joshua. Under the Judges (v. 3), we see the Amalekites united with the
                    Midianites and Moabites in a design to oppress Israel; but Ehud delivered the
                    Israelites from Eglon, king of the Moabites (Judg. iii.), and Gideon (chap,
                    viii.) delivered them from the Midianites and Amalekites. About the year of the
                    world 2930, Saul marched against the Ama-lekites, advanced as far as their
                    capital, and put all the people of the country to the sword; but he spared the
                    best of the cattle and movables, contrary to a divine command; which act of
                    disobedience was the cause of his future misfortunes.</p>
                <p>After this war the Amalekites scarcely appear any more in history. However, about
                    the year of the world 2949, a troop of Amalekites came and pillaged Ziklag,
                    which belonged to David (1 Sam. xxx.), where he had left his two wives, Ahinoam
                    and Abigail; but he returning from an expedition which he had made in the
                    company of Achish into the valley of Jezreel, pursued them, overtook and
                    dispersed them, and recovered all the booty which they had carried off from
                    Ziklag.</p>
                <p>The Arabians maintain that Amalek was the son of Ham, and grandson of Noah; that
                    he was the father of Ad, and grandfather of Schedad. Calmet thinks that this
                    opinion is by no means to be rejected, as it is not very probable that Amalek,
                    the son of Eliphaz, and grandson of Esau, should be the father of a people so
                    powerful and numerous as the Amalekites were when the Israelites departed out of
                    Egypt. Moses, in the book of Genesis (xiv. 7), relates, that in Abraham’s time,
                    long before the birth of Amalek the son of Eliphaz, the five confederate kings
                    carried the war into Amalek’s country, about Ka-desh; and into that of the
                    Amorites, about Hazezon-tamar. The same Moses (Num. xxiv. 20) relates, that the
                    diviner Balaam, observing at a distance the land of Ama-lek, said, in his
                    prophetic style, “Amalek is the first, the head, the original of the nations;
                    but his latter end shall be, that he perish for ever.” Our commentator observes,
                    that this epithet of the first of nations cannot certainly agree with the
                    Amalekites descended from the son of Eli-phaz, because the generation then
                    living was but the third from Amalek. Besides, Moses never reproaches the
                    Ama-lekites with attacking their brethren the Israelites; an aggravating
                    circumstance which he would not have omitted had the Amalekites been descended
                    from Esau, in which case they would have been the brethren of the Israelites.
                    Lastly, we see the Amalekites almost always classed in Scripture with the
                    Canaanites and the Philistines, and lever with the Edomites; and when Saul made
                    war upon the Amalekites, and almost utterly destroyed them, we do not find that
                    the Edomites made the least attempt to assist them, or to avenge their cause
                    afterwards. Thence it is thought probable that the Amalekites who are so often
                    mentioned in Scripture were a free people descended from Canaan, and devoted to
                    the curse as well as the 3ther Amorites, and very different from the descendants
                    if Amalek, the grandson of Esau.</p>
                <p>The accounts which the Arabians give us of the Amalekites destroyed by Saul are
                    as follows: Amalek was the father of an ancient tribe in Arabia, exterminated in
                    the reign of Saul. This tribe contained only the Arabians who are called <hi
                    rend="italic">Pure,</hi> the remains whereof were mingled with the posterity of
                    Joktan and Adnan, and so became Mosarabes or Mostaarabes; that is to say,
                    Arabians blend ed with foreign nations. They further believe that Goliath, who
                    was overcome by David, was king of the Amalekites; that the giants who inhabited
                    Palestine in Joshua’s time were of the same race; and that at last part of the
                    Amalekites retired into Africa while Joshua was yet living, and settled upon the
                    coasts of Barbary, along the Mediterranean Sea. The son of Amalek was Ad, a
                    celebrated prince among the Arabians. Some make him the son of Uz, and grandson
                    of Aram the son of Shem. Be this as it may, the Mahometans say that Ad was the
                    father of an Arabian tribe called <hi rend="italic">Ädites,</hi> who were
                    exterminated, as they tell us, for not hearkening to the patriarch Eber, who
                    preached to them the unity of God. Ad had two sons, Schedad and Schedid.</p>
