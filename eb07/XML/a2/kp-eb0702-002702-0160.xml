                <p><label type="entry">ABERDEEN</label>, <hi rend="italic">New,</hi> a considerable
                    seaport, and capital of the county of Aberdeen. It is situated on the German
                    Ocean, at the mouth of the river Dec, and in point of population, wealth, and
                    commerce, ranks as the chief town in the north of Scotland. In 1800, an act was
                    obtained for the general improvement of the city; and since this period its
                    whole appearance and plan have been changed. New and spacious streets have been
                    opened, bridges of communication have been built, and other improvements
                    executed, ornamental as well as useful. Union Street, which affords a splendid
                    access from the south and west, extends from the market-place 1350 yards, and is
                    70 feet wide The houses are built of dressed granite; and when the street is
                    completely filled up, it will present a fine appearance. To facilitate the
                    access into the town by means of this street, an elegant bridge, of a single
                    arch, the span of which is 132 feet, has been erected at an expense of L.10,000.
                    A new opening to the north has been made by King’s Street; and on the line of
                    this street there is also a bridge over the river Don, of five arches, each of
                    75 feet, which has been constructed at an expense of L.14,000. Since 1800,
                    numerous other new streets have been opened, and many of them nearly completed.
                    In consequence of these improvements, Aberdeen may be considered as a spacious,
                    elegant, and well-built city. The public buildings are numerous. There are about
                    30 places for divine worship. Connected with the established <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193030173" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0173-0028"/>religion are the East and
                    West churches, forming one continued building 170 feet in length, and adorned
                    with a spire 150 feet in height; besides seven chapels of ease. St Andrew’s
                    church is an elegant new building, constructed of freestone. There are three
                    episcopal chapels; five meeting-houses for seceders; eight congregational and
                    baptists; one methodist meeting-house; a Roman Catholic chapel, in which there
                    is a good organ; a quaker meetinghouse; two meeting-houses for relief people;
                    and four for independents.</p>
                <p>The charitable institutions are numerous. The infirmary is a large and commodious
                    building, for the reception and cure of the diseased poor, and has lately
                    received considerable additions. The managers were incorporated by royal charter
                    in 1773. It has extensive funds, derived from donations, bequests, and
                    periodical contributions. The lunatic asylum was opened in 1800, and is under
                    the same management as the infirmary. A large and elegant building has lately
                    been added to the original house, and ample accommodation is now afforded to all
                    the various classes of lunatics. There is a poor-house for the relief of the
                    indigent, the maintenance and education of destitute children and orphans.
                    Gordon’s hospital, for the maintenance of 90 boys, the sons of decayed
                    burgesses, is a handsome building, with a good statue of the founder in front. A
                    large addition is about to be made to this institution, in consequence of a
                    magnificent legacy lately received. There are two schools, one for boys and the
                    other for girls, on the Lancasterian plan. There is also another for the
                    education of the deaf and dumb. In addition to these, there are various other
                    schools and seminaries, which are supported by subscriptions, donations, and
                    bequests. There are ample funds of the seven incorporated trades for the support
                    of decayed members, widows, and orphans.</p>
                <p>The college called Marischal College was founded by George Keith, earl marshal,
                    in the year 1593. It has a library containing about 11,000 volumes, an
                    observatory, and an excellent apparatus of philosophical instruments attached to
                    the class of natural philosophy. The languages, mathematics, moral and natural
                    philosophy, natural history, and medicine, are taught here. The other public
                    buildings are the town-house and old tolbooth, which stands on the north side of
                    the market-place, and which is surmounted by a handsome spire 120 feet high;
                    behind which, and connected with it, has lately been erected the new
                    court-house, which combines the advantages of elegance, convenience, and
                    comfort. In the square, and fronting the town-house, stands the cross. It is
                    adorned with busts cut in stone of the royal family of Scotland, from James I.
                    to James VII. inclusive. The assembly-rooms, in Union Street, were built in
                    1821, by subscription. They are constructed of beautiful granite, handsomely
                    ornamented. The rooms, which are 90 feet in front, and 156 feet at the back of
                    the edifice, are splendidly finished in the interior. There are military
                    barracks, which were erected in 1796; a bridewell, opened in 1809; and a neat
                    theatre.</p>
                <p>The commerce and manufactures of Aberdeen are extensive and flourishing. One of
                    the most important branches of manufacture is the cotton, which was introduced
                    about the year 1779, and has given rise to some very great establishments, in
                    some of which steam-engines are employed. There are other smaller works, which
                    manufacture stripes, winseys, druggets, &amp;c. The whole give employment to
                    about 4000 hands. There are four large woollen manufactories, three of which are
                    moved by water, and the other, being the most extensive, by steam. In these are
                    manufactured superfine broad and narrow cloths, blankets and serges, stockings,
                    worsted yarns, &amp;c. The manufacture of carpeting, chiefly for the London and
                    American markets, has been introduced within these few years. The linen
                    manufacture, particularly that of thread, is carried on in all its branches to a
                    great extent. There are several breweries, in which porter and ales are made;
                    and considerable quantities are annually exported to America and the West
                    Indies. There are also several distilleries, the number of which has been
                    increased since the late reduction of the duty on spirits. Of late years some
                    extensive iron-works have been established, in which are manufactured ships’
                    anchors, chain-cables, steam-engines, spinning machinery, locks, hinges, &amp;c.
                    The proprietors of these works also built a large steam-vessel of 564 tons
                    burden. There are manufactures of soap, candles, leather, &amp;c. The granite
                    stones; so famous for their durability and strength, which are quarried,
                    dressed, and shipped from this port, form a staple commodity for exportation,
                    and are a great source of wealth to the place, by giving employment to many
                    thousands of industrious labourers. These stones are chiefly used for paving
                    streets; for building bridges, wharfs, and docks; for erecting light-houses,
                    &amp;c. There are six banking establishments in the town.</p>
                <p>The vessels which belong to the port of Aberdeen amount to 218, carrying 33,572
                    tons burden. They trade to North and South America, the West Indies, the
                    Mediterranean, the Baltic, Greenland, Davis’ Straits, and most of the ports of
                    the united kingdom. Ship-building is carried on to a great extent, and gives
                    employment to numerous hands. The want of any proper harbour was long a
                    detriment to the trade of Aberdeen, and occasioned the loss of many lives, and
                    of much property. It was narrow at the mouth, and being exposed in easterly
                    storms to the surf from the German Ocean, a bar of sand was raised quite across,
                    on which, at low water, there was not occasionally above three feet of water. To
                    remedy this defect a pier was built in 1776, by Smcaton, on the north side of
                    it, which extended a considerable way into the German Ocean; and by an act
                    obtained in 1810, it was still farther enlarged. This extensive quay is built of
                    large masses of dressed granite, and measures in length 2300 yards. In
                    consequence of this improvement they have now, a little to the south of the bar,
                    a depth of 17 fathoms at low water, and at the bar from 8 to 9 fathoms, where
                    they had formerly a few feet. The harbour is at present (1829) undergoing some
                    important improvements, by the construction of wet and dry docks, the extension
                    of the quay, &amp;c. for which purpose a new act was lately obtained from the
                    legislature.</p>
                <p>Aberdeen is a place of antiquity, its records being preserved from the time of
                    William the Lion, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1214. From the beginning of
                    the 15th century the journals of the magistrates and town-council came down in a
                    regular series. In the 13th century Aberdeen was a commercial place, and soon
                    grew to be of some note. It suffered occasionally from the casualties and
                    calamities incident to the almost continued warfare of that rude age. About the
                    beginning of the 14th century an English garrison occupied the castle of
                    Aberdeen. But this stronghold was taken by a sudden rising of the citizens, and
                    the English troops were all put to the sword. In 1333 and 1336 the town was
                    burnt by a fleet of Edward III.; it was speedily afterwards rebuilt, and was
                    afterwards known by the name of New Aberdeen. It unites with the burghs of
                    Bervie, Brechin, Montrose, and Arbroath, in sending a representative to
                    parliament. Population by the last return in 1821, 43,312, and has since
                    increased by several thousands. Distant 108 miles N. of Edinburgh, 118 from
