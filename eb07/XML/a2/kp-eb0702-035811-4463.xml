                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    d’</hi></label>, Chancellor of France, illustrious for his virtues, learning,
                    and talents, was born at Limoges on the 27th of November 1668. His father, at
                    that time intendant of Languedoc, and afterwards a counsellor of state, was a
                    man of great worth and abilities. He seems to have taken the sole charge of his
                    son’s education; and having destined him for the bar, he took uncommon pains to
                    exercise him in every branch of ] knowledge which could contribute to his
                    success in that profession. His care was rewarded with the happiest success.
                    Young D’Aguesseau gave early indications of uncommon abilities; and such was his
                    thirst for knowledge, and his habits of application, that he soon acquired the
                    reputation of an almost universal scholar. He had a particular relish for
                    poetry, which, he used to say, “was the only passion of his youth but this
                    passion was so far from withdrawing him from severer studies, that it was allied
                    in his mind with a nearly equal taste for mathematics. He studied law with the
                    zeal of an antiquary, and the spirit of a philosopher; and, in order to form his
                    taste as a pleader, he employed a whole year in repeated perusals of the most
                    esteemed productions of ancient eloquence. After this thorough course of
                    preparation, he became an advocate in 1690; and, by the interest of his father,
                    who then resided in Paris, he was soon furnished with opportunities of
                    distinguishing himself, and of rising to the highest honours of the profession.
                    When little more than 21 years of age, he was appointed one of the three <hi
                    rend="italic">Advocates· General,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> an office which
                    imposed the duty of assisting in those causes where the king, the church, or the
                    public was concerned. The king, Louis XIV., in appointing him, yet untried, to
                    this situation, acted solely upon the recommendation of the elder D’Aguesseau,
                    “who was incapable,” said Louis, “of deceiving him, even to advance his own
                    son.” D’Aguesseau’s first appearances as an advocate-general were such as amply
                    to fulfil the expectations of his father, and to warrant the appointment which
                    he had obtained from the king. Denis Talon, an old lawyer, who had long
                    officiated with great reputation in the same capacity, was heard to say, that
                    “he should have been glad to have finished his career as that young man had
                    begun.”</p>
                <p>D’Aguesseau held this office for ten years, during which period he greatly
                    distinguished himself, both for learning in his profession, and for a superior
                    style of forensic eloquence. He was, indeed, one of the first reformers of the
                    language of the French bar, which had not yet taken much polish from the
                    national improvements in taste and literature. His diction, both in his
                    pleadings and in his juridical compositions, was that of a mind expanded by a
                    liberal course of study, and refined by a familiar acquaintance with classical
                    models. The society which he chiefly frequented was also well adapted to improve
                    his taste; for the chosen companions of his leisure hours were Racine and
                    Boileau, the latter of whom has frequently mentioned him with praise in his
                    writings.</p>
                <p>It was D’Aguesseau’s opinion, that no one could rise to distinguished eminence as
                    an orator, who did not labour to enlarge his mind, and to improve his taste, by
                    the study of philosophy and by exercises of literature; and he accordingly
                    employed several of those stated Discourses, which the usages of France required
                    from the advocatesgeneral at the opening of the Sessions, to impress these views
                    upon the minds of the younger members of the bar. Such, in particular, was the
                    object of the Discourse, pronounced in 1695, <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi><hi

                <p>In the year 1700 he was appointed <hi rend="italic">Procurator-General</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193034476"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4476-0359"/>an office of higher dignity, and of more various
                    and extensive duties, than that of advocate-general. He filled this office for
                    seventeen years with the most splendid reputation; adding, by his lenity in
                    criminal cases, and by his care of the public hospitals, the praise of humanity
                    and benevolence to his other claims to the respect and admiration of his
                    countrymen. The political philosopher of the present day will probably, however,
                    be inclined to question the justness of the encomiums bestowed upon his
                    exertions during the severe scarcity of 1709; on which occasion he appears to
                    have instituted the most rigorous proceedings against those who were held up as
                    enemies of their country and of mankind, under the names of forestallers and
                    monopolists. But, in alluding to this part of his conduct, it maybe proper to
                    mention, that his opposition, at an after-period, to the delusive projects of
                    the famous John Law, and his elaborate treatise upon the subject of <hi
                    rend="italic">Money (</hi><hi rend="italic">Oeuvres,</hi> tom. x.), afford
                    undeniable proofs of the soundness of his views in regard to some of the most
                    important doctrines of political economy.</p>
                <p>It had been early predicted of D’Aguesseau, that he would one day fill the place
                    of Chancellor; and this prediction was at length realized in 1717, upon the
                    death of Voisin, who then held the seals. Though he was yet only forty-eight
                    years of age, his nomination to this high dignity gave general satisfaction, and
                    was, indeed, intended as a popular measure by the duke of Orleans, who had
                    lately assumed the regency. His brother Val-jouan, a man of abilities, but
                    slothful and 'a humourist, was the only person who refused to congratulate him
                    on the occasion. “Rather you than I, brother,” was his remark when the new
                    chancellor hastened to him to announce his appointment. In fact, D’Aguesseau
                    soon began to experience the difficulties and perils attendant upon his
                    elevation; for he had not been installed above a year, when he was deprived of
                    the seals, and exiled to his estate. His steady opposition to the extravagant
                    projects of Law, with which the regent and his ministers were wholly
                    intoxicated, was the honourable cause of this first reverse of fortune. In 1720,
                    when the ruinous consequences of these schemes had filled the nation with
                    distress and alarm, the chancellor was recalled from banishment; and he
                    contributed not a little, by the firmness and sagacity of his counsels, to calm
                    the public discontents, and repair the mischiefs which had been committed.</p>
                <p>Law himself had acted as the messenger of his recall; and it is said that
                    D’Aguesseau’s consent to re-accept the seals from the hand of this adventurer
                    was much blamed by the literary corps, with which he had hitherto stood in high
                    favour, as well as by the parliament. But his reputation appears to have
                    sustained a much severer shock, when he endeavoured to prevail with the latter
                    body to register the declaration of the late king in favour of the bull <hi
                    rend="italic">Unigenitus,—</hi> a measure which they held in great abhorrence,
                    and which he had himself firmly opposed during the life of Louis. The regent’s
                    favourite, Dubois, then archbishop of Cambray, had moved his master to insist
                    upon this act of registration, in the hope that he might thereby obtain a
                    cardinal’s hat; and it seems to have been thought that the chancellor had
                    yielded his better opinion in compliance with the wishes of this worthless
                    minion. Be this as it may, it is certain that he op]&gt;osed the favourite with
                    firmness, when he attempted, after being made prime minister, to take precedence
                    in the council; and he was in consequence, in 1722, sent a second time into
                    exile.</p>
                <p>He now passed five years on his estate at Fresnes; and he always spoke with
                    delight of this tranquil period, when he was left free from the cares of
                    professional duty, and the distractions of public life, to cultivate his mind.
                    The Scriptures, which he read and compared in various languages, and the
                    Jurisprudence of his own and other countries, formed the subjects of his more
                    serious studies: the rest of his time was devoted to philosophy and literature,
                    and the improvement of his park, where he was sometimes to be seen employed with
                    a spade.</p>
                <p>From these noble and congenial occupations he was again recalled, by the advice
                    of Cardinal Fleury, in 1727; but the seals were not restored to him till ten
                    years thereafter. During the intervening period he had endeavoured to mediate in
                    the new disputes which had arisen between the court and the parliament; but his
                    interference seems to have given satisfaction to neither party,—the one
                    reproaching him with desertion from their cause, and the other with too great a
                    leaning towards it. When the seals were at last restored to him, he completely
                    withdrew from all affairs of state, and devoted himself entirely to his duties
                    as chancellor, and to the introduction of those reforms which had long occupied
                    his inquiries and meditations.</p>
                <p>Besides some important enactments regarding Donations, Testaments, and
                    Successions, he introduced various regulations for improving the forms of
                    procedure, for ascertaining the limits of Jurisdictions, and for effecting a
                    greater uniformity in the execution of the laws throughout the several
                    provinces. These reforms constitute an epoch in the history of the jurisprudence
                    of France, and have associated his name with those illustrious benefactors of
                    her Civil Code, L’Hôpital and Lamoignon. The duke de Saint-Simon, however,
                    alleges that the chancellor’s reforms did not go so far as they would have gone
                    had he had less affection for his own order. He once, says this writer,
                    confessed to a nobleman who spoke to him as to the propriety of cutting off
                    certain lucrative abuses, that he could not bring his mind to a step which would
                    so grievously diminish the profits of the law.</p>
                <p>In 1750, when upwards of eighty-two years of age, he besought the king to accept
                    his resignation; and he was accordingly permitted to retire, the king continuing
                    to him the honours of his office as a special mark of his approbation. He died
                    in the following year, and was interred, according to his own request, in the
                    common burial-place of the village of Auteuil, where the remains of his wife,
                    who died there in 1735, had been deposited. The name of this lady, whom he
                    married in 1694, and by whom he had several children, was Anne Lefevre
                    d’Or-messon.</p>
                <p>This great man has not, in all respects, been equally praised by those who have
                    attempted to transmit his character to posterity. Saint-Simon and others
                    reproach him with a degree of tardiness and indecision, which sometimes greatly
                    obstructed the course of justice. His own answer to this charge has been
                    recorded by Duclos, and is worthy of notice: “When I recollect,” said he, “that
                    a decision of the chancellor makes a law, I think myself warranted in taking a
                    long time for consideration.” Saint-Simon and D’Argenson also impute to him some
                    defects as a practical statesman; but his elevation of mind and extensive
                    knowledge, his piety, probity, and disinterestedness, have been universally
                    admitted and extolled. In his magisterial capacity he was grave and dignified,
                    without any approach to haughtiness; in private society his manners were mild,
                    equal, and even playful. He was particularly remarkable for the tenaciousness of
                    his memory, and for the facility with which he could direct his attention to the
                    most diversified exercises of the intellectual powers. At eighty years of age he
                    has been heard to repeat whole poems which he had never perused since <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193034489" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4489-0360"/> the days of his
                    early youth; and, when fatigued with professional duties, he could turn with
                    equal alacrity to Euclid or to Racine. In summing up his character, all must
                    agree with Laharpe, that he was “a man who did honour to France, to the
                    magistracy, and to letters, by his virtues, his talents, his profound and
                    various learning, and his enlightened views in the science of jurisprudence.”

                <p>His published writings form a collection of thirteen volumes quarto, of which the
                    first was published at Paris in 1759, and the last in 1789. The far greater part
                    of these volumes relates to matters connected with his professional occupations
                    and studies; but they also contain a variety of pieceb upon other subjects. We
                    have already mentioned his Discourses on the studies befitting the students of
                    law, and his treatise on Money. Besides these, and some Theological Pieces,
                    there is a Life of his Father,—interesting from the view which it affords of his
                    own early education under that excellent person; and Metaphysical Meditations,
                    written in vindication of the grand truth, that independently of all revelation,
