                    Alexander</hi></label> (Lord Abercromby), a Judge in the Courts of Session and
                    Justiciary in Scotland, was the youngest son of George Abercromby, of Tullibody,
                    Esq. of a respectable family in Clackmannanshire, and was born on the 15th
                    October 1745. Mr Abercromby was early destined for the profession of the law,
                    and with this view he was educated at the university of Edinburgh, where he
                    passed through the requisite course of languages, philosophy, and law, and was
                    admitted advocate in the year 1766. In 1780 he resigned the office of
                    sheriff-depute of Stirlingshire, which he had held for several years, and
                    accepted of that of depute-advocate, with the hope of extending his employment
                    in the line of his profession. In this step he was not disappointed; for his
                    reputation and business rapidly increased, and soon raised him to the first rank
                    at the Scotch bar. But he still retained a taste for the elegant amusements of
                    polite literature, and was one of that society who set on foot two periodical
                    papers, the <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lounger,</hi>
                    published at Edinburgh; the former in 1779, and the latter in 1785. To the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mirror</hi> he contributed ten papers, and to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lounger</hi> nine. The names of the authors have been published in
                    the late editions of these works, which renders it unnecessary to point out
                    those papers of which Mr Abercromby was the author. In May 1792, he was
                    appointed one of the Judges of the Court of Session, and in December following
                    he was called to a seat in the Court of Justiciary. Lord Abercromby continued to
                    discharge the arduous duties of these important offices till summer 1795, when
                    he was seized with a pectoral complaint, of which he died on the 17th November
                    the same year, at Exmouth in Devonshire, where he had gone for the recovery of
                    his health.</p>

                    the Bath, arid a lieutenant-general in the British army, an elder brother of the
                    preceding, was born in the year 1738. Being destined for the army, he obtained,
                    in May 1756, a cornet’s commission in the 2d dragoon guards; and rose, April 24.
                    1762, to the rank of a captain in the 3d regiment of horse. Ascending through
                    the intermediate gradations of rank, he was appointed, November 3. 1781, to the
                    colonelcy of the 103d infantry. September 28. 1787, he was promoted to the rank
                    of major-general. November 5. 1795, he obtained the command of the 7th regiment
                    of dragoons. Having been nearly 40 years in the army, having served with honour
                    in two wars, and being esteemed one of the ablest, coolest, and most intrepid
                    officers in the whole British forces, he was employed on the continent under his
                    Royal Highness the Duke of York, in the commencement of the war against the
                    French republic. In the action on the heights of Cateau, he commanded the
                    advanced guard, and was wounded at Nimeguen. He conducted the march of the
                    guards from Deventer to O1densal, in the retreat of the British out of Holland,
                    in the winter of 1794-5. In August 1795, he was appointed to succeed Sir Charles
                    Grey, as commander-in-chief of the British forces in the West Indies. March
                    24.1796, Grenada was suddenly attacked and taken by a detachment of the army
                    under his orders. He afterwards obtained possession of the settlements of
                    Demerara and Essequibo, in South America. St Lucia was next taken by more
                    difficult exertions, in which his ability was signalIy displayed. St Vincent
                    was, by the middle of June, added to the British conquests. Trinidad, in
                    February 1797, shared the same fate. He returned the same year to Europe, and,
                    in reward for such important services, was invested with the red ribbon,
                    appointed to the command of the regiment of Scots Greys, intrusted with the
                    governments of the Isle of Wight, Fort George, and Fort Augustus, and raised to
                    the rank of lieutenant-general. He held, for a time, the chief command of the
                    forces in Ireland. In that command, he laboured to maintain the discipline of
                    the army, to suppress the rising rebellion, and to protect the people from
                    military oppression, with a care worthy alike of the great general and the
                    enlightened and beneficent statesman. From that station he was called to the
                    chief command of the forces in Scotland. When the enterprise against Holland was
                    resolved upon, Sir Ralph Abercromby was called again to command, under his <pb

                    Duke of York. The difficulties of the ground, the inclemency of the season,
                    delays, though inconvenient, yet unavoidable, the disorderly movements of the
                    Russians, and the timid duplicity of the Dutch, disappointed our hopes of that
                    expedition. But by the Dutch, the French, the British, it was confessed, that
                    even victory the most decisive could not have more conspicuously proved the
                    talents of this distinguished officer. His country applauded the choice, when,
                    in 1801, he was sent with an army to dispossess the French of Egypt. His
                    experience in Holland and Flanders, and in the climate of the West Indies,
                    particularly fitted him for this new command. He accomplished some of the first
                    duties of a general, in carrying his army in health, in spirits, and with the
                    requisite intelligence and supplies, to the destined scene of action. The
                    landing, the first dispositions, the attack, and the superiority over the French
                    which the British infantry under his command evinced, all bear testimony to the
                    high military talents of this commander. It was his fate to fall in the moment
                    of victory. General Lord Hutchinson, who succeeded him in the command, in the
                    dispatches with the account of his death, has given a fine eulogium on his
                    character as a soldier, and strongly expressive of the high estimation in which
                    he was held by the army.—“We have sustained an irreparable loss in the person of
                    our never sufficiently to be lamented commander-in-cliief, Sir Ralph Abercromby,
                    who was mortally wounded in the action, and died on the 28th of March. I believe
                    he was wounded early, but he concealed his situation from those about him, and
                    continued in the field, giving his orders with that coolness and perspicuity
                    which had ever marked his character, till long after the action was over, when
                    he fainted through weakness and loss of blood. Were it permitted for a soldier
                    to regret any one who has fallen in the service of his country, I might be
                    excused for lamenting him more than any other person; but it is some consolation
                    to those who tenderly loved him, that, as his life was honourable, so was his
                    death glorious. His memory will be recorded in the annals of his country—will be
                    sacred to every British soldier—and embalmed in the recollection of a grateful
                    posterity.” His remains were conveyed on board Admiral Lord Keith’s flag-ship to
                    Malta, attended by Colonel Sir John Dyer, and were interred in the commandery of
                    the grand master, with the highest military honours. A monument to his memory
                    was erected in St Paul’s church, London, in pursuance of a vote of the House of
                    Commons. His widow was created a peeress, and a pension of L.2000 a-year for her
                    and three lives settled on the family. <hi rend="italic">( Gent. Mag.')</hi></p>
