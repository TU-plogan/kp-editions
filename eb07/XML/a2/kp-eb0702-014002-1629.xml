                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    prelate, archbishop of St Andrews, was born in the year 1543 in the town of
                    Perth, where he received the rudiments of his education; and afterwards studied
                    philosophy, and took his degree of master of arts, at the university of St
                    Andrews. In 1566 he set out for Paris as tutor to a young gentleman. In the
                    month of June of the same year, Mary Queen of Scots being delivered of a son,
                    afterwards James VI. of Scotland and I. of England, Mr Adamson wrote a Latin
                    poem on the occasion. In this poem he gave the prince the title of king of
                    France and England; and this proof of his loyalty involved him in difficulties,
                    for the French court was offended, and ordered him to be arrested; and he was
                    confined for six months. He was released only through the intercession of Queen
                    Mary and some of the principal nobility, who interested themselves in his
                    behalf. As soon as he recovered his liberty, he retired with his pupil to
                    Bourges. He was in this city during the massacre at Paris; and the same
                    persecuting spirit prevailing among the Catholics at Bourges as at the
                    metropolis, he lived concealed for seven months in a public house, the master of
                    which, upwards of 70 years of age, was thrown from its top and had his brains
                    dashed out, for his charity to heretics. Whilst Mr Adamson lay thus in his
                    sepulchre, as he called it, he wrote his Latin poetical version of the book of
                    Job, and his tragedy of Herod in the same language. In the year 1573, he
                    returned to Scotland, and, having entered into holy orders, became minister of
                    Paisley. In the year 1575, he was appointed one of the commissioners, by the
                    general assembly, to settle the jurisdiction and policy of the church; and the
                    following year he was named, with Mr David Lindsay, to report their -proceedings
                    to the earl of Morton, then regent. About this time the earl appointed him one
                    of his chaplains; and, on the death of Bishop Douglas, promoted him to the
                    archiepiscopal see of St Andrews, a dignity which brought upon him great trouble
                    and uneasiness; for now the clamour of the Presbyterian party rose very high
                    against him, and many inconsistent absurd stories were propagated concerning
                    him. Soon after his promotion, he published his catechism in Latin verse, a work
                    highly approved even by his enemies; but, nevertheless, they still continued to
                    persecute him with great violence. In 1578 he submitted himself to the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193031642" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1642-0141"/> general assembly,
                    which procured him peace but for a very little time; for, the year following,
                    fresh accusations were brought against him. In the year 1582, being attacked
                    with a grievous disease, in which the physicians could give him no relief, he
                    happened to take a simple medicine from an old woman, which did him service. The
                    woman, whose name was Alison Pearson, was thereupon charged with witchcraft, and
                    committed to prison, but escaped out of her confinement; however, about four
                    years afterwards, she was again found and burnt for a witch. In 1583 King James
                    came to St Andrews; and the archbishop, being much recovered, preached before
                    him, and disputed with Mr Andrew Melville, in presence of his Majesty, with
                    great reputation; which drew upon him fresh calumny and persecution. The king,
                    however, was so well pleased with him, that he sent him ambassador to Queen
                    Elizabeth, at whose court he resided for some years. His conduct during his
                    embassy has been variously reported by different authors. Two things he
                    principally laboured, viz. the recommending the king his master to the nobility
                    and gentry of England, and the procuring some support for the episcopal party in
                    Scotland. His eloquent preaching drew after him such crowds of people, and
                    raised in their minds so high an idea of the young king his master, that Queen
                    Elizabeth forbade him to enter the pulpit during his stay in her dominions. In
                    1584 he was recalled, and sat in the parliament held in August at Edinburgh. The
                    Presbyterian party was still very violent against the archbishop. A provincial
                    synod was held at St Andrews in April 1586: the archbishop was here accused and
                    excommunicated. He appealed to the king and the states, but this availed him
                    little; for the mob being excited against him, he durst scarcely appear in
                    public. At the next general assembly, a paper being produced containing the
                    archbishop’s submission, he was absolved from the excommunication. In 1588 fresh
                    accusations were brought against him. The year following he published the
                    Lamentations of the prophet Jeremiah in Latin verse, which he dedicated to the
                    king, complaining of his hard usage. In the latter end of the same year he
                    published a translation of the Apocalypse in Latin verse, and a copy of Latin
                    verses, addressed also to liis Majesty, deploring his distress. The king,
                    however, was not moved by his application, for the revenue of his see was
                    granted to the duke of Lennox; so that the prelate and his family were literally
                    reduced to the want of bread. During the remaining part of his unfortunate life
                    he was supported by charitable contribution, and he died in 1591. The character
                    of this prelate has been variously represented, according to the sentiments of
                    religion and politics which prevailed. But there is little doubt that he
                    encouraged and supported, under the authority of the king, oppressive and
                    injurious measures. His learning was unquestioned, and he acquired great
                    reputation as a popular preacher. In his adversity he submitted with pious
                    resignation to his hard fate. The panegyric of the editor of his works, Mr
                    Wilson, is extravagant and absurd. He says, that “he was a miracle of nature,
                    and rather seemed to be the immediate production of God Almighty, than born of a
                    woman.”</p>
