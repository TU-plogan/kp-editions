                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ACCLAMATION</label>, a confused noise or shout of joy, by
                    which the public express their applause, esteem, or approbation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Acclamation,</hi> in a more proper sense, denotes a certain
                    form of words, uttered with extraordinary vehemence, and in a peculiar tone
                    somewhat resembling a song, frequent in the ancient assemblies. Acclamations
                    were usually accompanied with applauses, with which they are sometimes
                    confounded, though they ought to be distinguished; as acclamation was given by
                    the voice, applause by the hands: add, that acclamation was also bestowed on
                    persons absent, applause only on those present. Acclamation was also given by
                    women, whereas applause seems to have been confined to men.</p>
                <p>Acclamations are of various kinds; ecclesiastical, military, nuptial, senatorial,
                    synodical, scholastical, theatrical, &amp;c. We meet with loud acclamations,
                    musical and rhythmical acclamations; acclamations of joy and respect, and even
                    of reproach and contumely. The former, wherein words of happy omen were used,
                    were also called <hi rend="italic">Laudationes</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bona</hi><hi rend="italic">vota,</hi> or good wishes; the latter,
                    <hi rend="italic">Execrationes</hi><hi rend="italic">et convicia.</hi> Suetonius
                    furnishes an instance of this last kind in the Roman senate, on occasion of the
                    decree for demolishing the statues of Domitian, when the fathers, as the
                    historian represents it, could not refrain from contumelious acclamations of the
                    deceased. The like were, shown after the death of Commodus, where the
                    acclamations run in the following strain :— <hi rend="italic">Hosti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">patriae</hi><hi rend="italic">honores detrahantur,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">parricidae</hi><hi rend="italic">honores detrahantur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">hostis statuas Undique,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">parricidae</hi><hi rend="italic">statuas undique, gladiatoris
                    statuas undique,</hi> &amp;c. The formula, in acclamations, was repeated <hi
                    rend="subscript">;</hi> sometimes a greater, sometimes a lesser number of times.
                    Hence we find in Roman writers, <hi rend="italic">acclamatum est
                    quinquies,</hi><hi rend="italic">et vicies;</hi> five times, and twenty times;
                    sometimes also <hi rend="italic">sexagies,</hi> and even <hi rend="italic"
                    >octuagies</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> sixty and eighty times.</p>
                <p>Acclamations were not unknown in the theatres in the earliest ages of the Roman
                    commonwealth; but tķey were artless then, and little other than confused shouts.
                    Afterwards they became a sort of regular concerts. That mentioned by Phaedrus,
                    <hi rend="italic">Laetare incolumis, Roma, Salvo Prin-</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193030953" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0953-0088"/><hi rend="italic">cipe,</hi>
                    which was made for Augustus, and proved the occasion of a pleasant mistake of a
                    flute-player called <hi rend="italic">Princeps,</hi> shows that musical
                    acclamations were in use in that emperor’s reign. <hi rend="italic">Pevertentem
                    ex</hi><hi rend="italic">provincia modulatis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >carminibus</hi><hi rend="italic">prosequebantur,</hi> says Suetonius, who gives
                    another instance'in the time of Tiberius: a false report of Germa-nicus’s
                    recovery being spread through Rome, the people ran in crowds to the Capitol with
                    torches and victims, singing, <hi rend="italic">Salva Poma, Salva</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Patria, Salvus est Germanicus.</hi> Nero, passionately fond of
                    music, took special care to improve and perfect the music of acclamations.
                    Charmed with the harmony with which the Alexandrians, who came to the games
                    celebrated at Naples, had sung his praises, he brought several over to instruct
                    a number of youth, chosen from among the knights and people, in the different
                    kinds of acclamations practised in Alexandria. These continued in use as long as
                    the reign of Theodoric. But the people did not always make a single chorus;
                    sometimes there were two, who answered each other alternately: thus, when Nero
                    played in the theatre, Burrhus and Seneca, who were on either hand, giving the
                    signal by clapping, 5000 soldiers, called <hi rend="italic">Augustals,</hi>
                    began to chant his praise, which the spectators were obliged to repeat. The
                    whole was conducted by a music-master, called <hi rend="italic">mesochorus</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">pausarius.</hi> The honour of acclamations was chiefly
                    rendered to emperors, their children, and favourites; and to the magistrates who
                    presided at the games. Persons of distinguished merit also sometimes received
                    them, of which Quintilian gives us instances in Cato and Virgil. The most usual
                    forms were, <hi rend="italic">Feliciter, Longiorem vitam, Annos felices.</hi>
                    The actors themselves, and they who gained the prizes in the games of the
                    circus, were not excluded the honour of acclamations.</p>
                <p>To theatrical acclamations may be added those of the soldiery and the people in
                    time of triumph. The victorious army accompanied their general to the Capitol;
                    and, among the verses they sung in his praises, frequently repeated Io <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Triumphe,</hi> which the people answered in the same strain. It
                    was also in the way of acclamation that the soldiers gave their general the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Imperator,</hi> after some notable victory; a title
                    which he only kept till the time of his triumph.</p>
                <p>The acclamations of the senate were somewhat more serious than the popular ones,
                    but arose from the same principle, viz. a desire of pleasing the prince or his
                    favourites; and aimed likewise at the same end, either to express the general
                    approbation and zeal of the company, or to congratulate him on his victories, or
                    to make him new protestations of fidelity. These acclamations were usually given
                    after a report made by some senator, to which the rest all expressed their
                    consent by crying, <hi rend="smallcaps">Omnes, Omnes</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >;</hi> or else, <hi rend="smallcaps">AEöuum</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">est,
                    Justum</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">est.</hi> Sometimes they began with
                    acclamations, and sometimes ended with them, without other debates. It was after
                    this manner that all the elections and proclamations of emperors, made by the
                    senate, were conducted; something of which practice is still retained at modern
                    elections of kings and emperors, where <hi rend="italic">Vivat</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pex,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Long live the King,</hi> are
                    customary forms of acclamation.</p>
                <p>The Greeks borrowed the custom of receiving their emperors in the public places
                    from the Romans. Luit-prand relates, that at a procession where he was present,
                    they sung to the Emperor Nicephorus, &lt;roaλα <hi rend="italic">ετεα</hi>; that
                    is, <hi rend="italic">many years</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which Coddin
                    expresses thus, by <hi rend="italic">το</hi> ∙ψαλλi∕μ <hi rend="italic">το
                    πολυχξονιον,</hi> or by <hi rend="italic">τo πολυχξονιζειν</hi>; and the wish or
                    salutation by <hi rend="italic">πολυχξονισμα.</hi> And at dinner, the Greeks
                    then present wished with a loud voice to the emperor and Bardas, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ut</hi><hi rend="italic">Deus</hi><hi rend="italic">annos
                    multiplicet,</hi> as he translates the Greek. Plutarch mentions an acclamation
                    so loud, upon occasion of Flaminius’s restoring liberty to Greece, that the very
                    birds fell from heaven with the shout. The Turks practise something like this,
                    on the sight of their emperors and grand viziers, to this day.</p>
                <p>For the acclamations with which authors, poets, &amp;c.· were received, who
                    recited their works in public; it is to be observed, the assemblies for this
                    purpose were held with great parade in the most solemn places, as the Capitol,
                    temples, the Athenaeum, and the houses of great men. The chief care was that the
                    acclamations might be given with all the order and pomp possible. Men of fortune
                    who pretended to wit, kept able applauders in their service, and lent them to
                    their friends. Others endeavoured to gain them by presents and treats.
                    Philo-stratus mentions a young man named Vavus, who lent money to the men of
                    letters, and forgave the interest to such as applauded his exercises. These
                    acclamations were conducted much after the same manner as those in the theatre,
                    both as to the music and the accompaniments: they were to be suited both to the
                    subject and to the person. There were particular ones for the philosophers, for
                    orators, for historians, and for poets. It would be difficult to rehearse all
                    the forms of them; one of the most usual was <hi rend="italic">Sophos,</hi>
                    which was to be repeated three times. Martial comprehends several other usual
                    forms in this verse:</p>
                <l part="N"><hi rend="italic">Graviter, Cito, Nequiter, Euge, Beate.</hi></l>
                <p>Neither the Greeks nor Romans were barren on this head. The names of gods and
                    heroes were given to those whom they would extol. It was not enough to do it
                    after each head of discourse, chiefly after the exordium; but the acclamations
                    were renewed at every fine passage, frequently at every period.</p>
                <p>The acclamations with which the spectators honoured the victories of the
                    athletae, were a natural consequence of the impetuous motions which attended the
                    gymnastic games. The cries and acclamations of the people, sometimes expressing
                    their compassion and joy, sometimes their horror and disgust, are strongly
                    painted by different poets and orators.</p>
                <p>Acclamations made also a part of the ceremony of marriage. They were used for the
                    omen’s sake, being the <hi rend="italic">Laeta</hi><hi rend="italic">Omina</hi>
                    sometimes spoken of before marriage in Roman writers.</p>
                <p>Acclamations, at first practised in the theatre, and passing thence to the
                    senate, &amp;c. were, in process of time, received into the acts of councils,
                    and the ordinary assemblies of the church. The people expressed their
                    approbation of the preacher variously; the more usual forms were, <hi
                    rend="italic">Orthodox! Third Apostle,</hi> &amp;c. These acclamations being
                    sometimes carried to excess, and often misplaced, were frequently prohibited by
                    the ancient doctors, and at length abrogated; though they appear to have been in
                    some use about the time of St Bernard.</p>
