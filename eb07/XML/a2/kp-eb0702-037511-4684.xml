                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Albani,</hi><hi rend="italic">Francis,</hi> a celebrated
                    painter, born in Bologna, March 17. 1578. His father was a silk merchant, and
                    intended to bring up his son to that business; but Albani, having a strong
                    inclination to painting, when his father died, devoted himself entirely to that
                    art, though then but twelve years of age. He first studied under Denys Calvert,
                    Guido Reni being at the same time under this master, with whom Albani contracted
                    a very great friendship. Calvert drew but one profile for Albani, and afterwards
                    left him entirely to the care of Guido, under whom he made great improvement,
                    his fellow-discipleinstructing him with the utmost humanity and good-humour. He
                    followed Guido to the school of the Caracci; but a little after, their
                    friendship for each other began to cool, which was owing perhaps to the pride of
                    Albani, who could not bear to see Guido surpass him, or to the jealousy of Guido
                    at finding Albani make such rapid progress. They certainly endeavoured to
                    eclipse one another; for when Guido had set up a beautiful altar-piece, Albani
                    would oppose to it some fine picture of his. Thus did they behave for some time,
                    and yet spoke of each other with the highest esteem. Albani, after having
                    greatly improved himself under the Caracci, went to Rome, where he continued
                    many years, and married in that city; but his wife dying in childbed, at the
                    earnest request of his relations he returned to Bologna, where he entered again
                    into the state of matrimony. His second wife (Doralice) was well descended, but
                    had very little fortune; which he perfectly disregarded, so -strongly was he
                    captivated with her beauty and good sense. Albani, besides the satisfaction of
                    possessing an accomplished wife, reaped likewise the advantage of having a most
                    beautiful model; so that he had now no occasion to make use of any other woman
                    to paint a Venus, the Graces, •Nymphs, and other deities, whom he took a
                    particular de- .light in representing. His wife answered this purpose admirably
                    well; for besides her bloom of youth, and the beauty of her person, he
                    discovered in her so much modesty, so many graces and perfections, so well
                    adapted to painting, that it was impossible for him to meet with a more finished
                    woman. She afterwards brought him several boys, all extremely beautiful and
                    finely proportioned; so that she and her children were the originals of his most
                    agreeable and graceful compositions. Doralice was so conformable to his
                    intentions, that she took a pleasure in setting the children in different
                    attitudes, holding them naked, and sometimes suspended by strings, when Albani
                    would draw them in a thousand different ways. It was from them, too, that the
                    famous sculptors Flamand and Argaldi modelled their little Cupids.</p>
                <p>Albani was of a happy temper and disposition; his paintings, says Malvasia,
                    breathing nothing but content and joy. Happy in a force of mind that conquered
                    every uneasiness, his poetical pencil carried him through the most agreeable
                    gardens to Paphos and Cythera; those delightful scenes brought him over the
                    lofty Parnassus to the delicious abodes of Apollo and the Muses: whence what Du
                    Fresnoy says of the famous Giulio Romano may be justly applied to Albani :—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Taught from a child in the bright Muses’ grots, </l>
                    <l part="N"> He open’d all the treasures of Parnassus, </l>
                    <l part="N"> And in the lively poetry of painting </l>
                    <l part="N"> The myst’ries of Apollo has reveal’d. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>He died the 4th of October 1660, to the great grief of all his friends and the
                    whole city of Bologna. Malvasia has preserved some verses of Francisco de
                    Lemene, intended for his monument; the sense whèreof is, “that the mortal
                    remains of the illustrious Albani, he who gave life to shade, he interred in
                    this tomb. The earth never produced so wonderful an artist, nor a hand equal to
                    bis immortal one, which gave colour to the soul, and a soul to colours.
                    Prometheus animated clay, and gave life by means of the sun; but Albani animated
                    merely by the assistance of shade.” He was very famous in his lifetime, and had
                    been visited by the greatest painters. Several princes honoured him with
                    letters; and amongst the rest King Charles I., who invited him to England by a
                    letter signed with his own hand.</p>
