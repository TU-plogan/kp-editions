                    of Macedonia. His father Philip laid the plan of that extensive empire which his
                    son afterwards completed. Philip, having made himself master of Greece, began to
                    cast his eyes upon Persia, with a view to retaliate upon that haughty empire the
                    injuries of former times. It was the popular topic of the day. But this prince
                    was cut off in the midst of his enterprise. Such, however, was the influence of
                    Alexander in the assembly of the Grecian states, that he was created general of
                    their combined forces, in the room of his father. Having made every needful
                    preparation, at the head of a veteran army he invaded Asia. The lieutenants of
                    Darius, who was then king of Persia, opposed him at the river Granicus, where
                    Alexander obtained a complete victory, after which he pursued his march through
                    Asia. At Issus, near Scanderoon, he was met by Darius in person, at the head of
                    a prodigious army. Here he obtained a second victory, and took the camp of
                    Darius, together with his family, whom he treated with the utmost humanity.
                    Contrary to all the maxims of war, instead of pursuing Darius, he made an
                    excursion into Egypt, and, as far as appears, through no better motives than
                    those of vanity. Here he was acknowledged to be the son of Jupiter Ammon. In the
                    mean time Darius recruited his strength, and got together an army superior to
                    what he brought into the plain of Issus. Alexander, having finished his Egyptian
                    expedition, traversed Asia, and passed the Euphrates. At Arbela, a town in
                    Assyria, he met Darius. Here a decisive battle was fought, which put all Persia
                    into the hands of Alexander. His ambition not being satisfied with the conquest
                    of that vast country, he projected an expedition into India. Here he met with
                    great opposition from Po-rus, a gallant prince, whom in the end he reduced.
                    Beyond the Ganges lay a country still unsubdued. He notified it to his army,
                    that he proposed to pass the river. But these veterans, harassed with their
                    fatigues, and seeing no end of their labour, mutinied, and refused to march
                    further. The disappointed chief was therefore obliged to return. At Babylon he
                    proposed to receive ambassadors, appoint governors, and settle his vast
                    monarchy; but his excesses put an end to his life in the midst of his designs,
                    and in the flower of his age.</p>
                <p>The character of this hero is so familiar to every body, that it is almost
                    needless labour to draw it All the world knows, says Mr Bayle, that it was
                    equally composed of very great virtues and very great vices. He had no
                    mediocrity in any thing but his stature: in his other properties, whether good
                    or bad, he was all extremes. His ambition rose even to madness. His father was
                    not at all mistaken in supposing the bounds of Macedon too small for his son;
                    for how could Macedon bound the ambition of a man who reckoned the whole world
                    too small a dominion? He wept at hearing the philosopher Anaxarchus say that
                    there was an infinite number of worlds: his tears were owing to his despair of
                    conquering them all, since he had not yet been able to conquer one. Livy, in a
                    short digression, has attempted to inquire into the events which might have
                    happened if Alexander, after the conquest of Asia, had brought his arms into
                    Italy. Doubtless, things might have taken a very different turn with him; and
                    all the grand projects which succeeded so well against an effeminate Persian
                    monarch might easily have miscarried if he had had to do with rough, hardy,
                    Roman armies. And yet the vast aims of this mighty conqueror, if seen under
                    another point of view, may appear to have been confined in a very narrow
                    compass; since, as we are told, the utmost wish of that great heart, for which
                    the whole earth was not big enough, was, after all, to be praised by the
                    Athenians: for it is related, that the difficulties which he encountered in
                    order to pass the Hydaspes, forced him to cry out, “0 Athenians, could you
                    believe to what dangers I expose myself for the sake of being celebrated by you
                    ?” But Bayle affirms that this was quite consistent with the vast unbounded
                    extent of his ambition, as he wanted to make all future time his own, and be an
                    object of admiration to the latest posterity; yet did not expect this from the
                    conquest, of worlds, but from books. “He was perfectly in the right,” says
                    Bayle; “for if Greece had not furnished him with good writers, he would long ago
                    have been as much forgotten as the kings who reigned in Macedon before
                    Amphitryon.”</p>
                <p>His excesses with regard to wine were notorious, and he committed, when drunk, a
                    thousand extravagancies. It was owing to wine that he killed Clitus, who saved
                    his life, and burnt Persepolis, one of the most beautiful cities of the East: he
                    did this last, indeed, at the instigation of the courtesan Thai's; but this
                    circumstance made it only the more heinous. It is generally believed that he
                    died by drinking immoderately; and even Plutarch, who affects to contradict it,
                    owns that he did nothing but drink the whole day he was taken ill. The reader
                    who is desirous of further information in regard to Alexander and his
                    historians, may consult Μ. de St Croix’s <hi rend="italic">Critical Inquiry

                    Neapolitan lawyer, of great learning, who flourished toward the end of the 15th
                    and beginning of the 16th century. He followed the profession of the law, first
                    at Naples, afterwards at Rome: but he devoted all the time he could spare to the
                    study of polite literature; and at length he entirely left the bar, that he
                    might lead a more easy and agreeable life with the Muses. The particulars of his
                    life are to be gathered from his work entitled <hi rend="italic">Dies</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Geniales.</hi> We are there informed that he lodged at Rome, in a
                    house that was haunted; and he relates many surprising particulars about the
                    ghost. He says also, that when he was very young, he went to the lectures of
                    Philelphus, who explained at Rome the Tusculan Questions of Cicero. He was there
                    also when Nicholas Perot and Domitius Calderinus read their lectures upon
                    Martial. The particular time when he died is not known; but he was buried in the
                    monastery of the Olivets. Tiraqueau wrote a learned commentary upon his work,
                    which was printed at Lyons in 1587, and reprinted at Leyden in 1673, with the
                    notes of Dennis Godfrey, Christopher Colerus, and Nicholas Mercerus.</p>

                    writer of the 17th century, born at Rouen, in Normandy, 1639. After finishing
                    his studies at Rouen, he entered into the order of Dominican friars, and was
                    professed there in 1655. Soon after he went to Paris, to go through a course of
                    philosophy and divinity in the great convent, where he distinguished himself so,
                    that he was appointed to teach philosophy there, which he did for twelve years.
                    Μ. Colbert showed him many marks of his esteem; <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    and being determined to omit nothing to perfect the education of his son,
                    afterwards archbishop of Rouen, he formed an assembly of the most learned
                    persons, whose conferences upon ecclesiastical history might be of advantage to
                    him. Father Alexander was invited to this assembly, where he exerted himself
                    with so much genius and ability, that he gained the particular friendship of
                    young Colbert, who showed him the utmost regard as long as he lived. These
                    conferences gave rise to Alexander’s design of writing an ecclesiastical<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193035113" xml:id="kp-eb0702-5113-0408"/> history; for,
                    being desired to reduce what was material in these conferences to writing, he
                    didit with so much accuracy, that the learned men who composed this assembly
                    advised him to undertake a complete body of church history. This he executed
                    with great assiduity, collecting and digesting the materials himself, and
                    writing even the tables with his own hand. He at last completed his work in
                    1686. Towards the latter part of his life he was afflicted with the loss of his
                    sight; a most inexpressible misfortune to one whose whole pleasure was in study,
                    yet he bore it with great patience and resignation. He died merely of a decay of
                    nature, 1724, in the 86th year of his age.</p>

                    regulated his conduct. He applied himself to the reformation of abuses, the
                    state having been greatly disordered by the vicious conduct of his predecessor.
                    He was a most strict lover of justice, an encourager of learning and learned
                    men, and favourable to the Christians. He made a successful expedition against
                    the Persians; but endeavouring to reform his troops, who had grown very
                    licentious under the late bad government, they murdered him at the instigation

                    Norman by birth, and nephew of the famous Roger, bishop of Salisbury, who first
                    made him archdeacon of Salisbury, and afterwards, by his interest with the king,
                    raised him to the mitre. Alexander was consecrated at Canterbury, July 22. 1123.
                    Having received his education under his uncle the bishop of Salisbury, and been
                    accustomed to a splendid way of living, he affected show and state, more than
                    was suitable to his character or consistent with his fortune. This failing
                    excepted, he was a man worthy of honour, and every way qualified for his
                    station. The year after his consecration, his cathedral church at Lincoln having
                    been accidentally burnt down, he rebuilt it, and secured it against the like
                    accident for the future by a stone roof. This prelate increased the number of
                    prebends in his church, and augmented its revenues with several manors and
                    estates. In imitation of the barons and some of the bishops, particularly his
                    uncle the bishop of Salisbury, he built three castles; one at Banbury, another
                    at Sleaford, and a third at Newark. He likewise founded two monasteries; one at
                    Haverholm, for regular canons and nuns together; the other at Tame, for white
                    friars. He went twice to Rome, in the years 1142 and 1144. The first time, he
                    came back in quality of the pope’s legate for calling a synod, in which he
                    published several wholesome and necessary canons. In August 1147 he took a third
                    journey to the pope, who was then in France, where he fell sick through the
                    excessive heat of the weather, and returned with great difficulty to England,
                    where he died, in the 24th year of his prelacy.</p>
