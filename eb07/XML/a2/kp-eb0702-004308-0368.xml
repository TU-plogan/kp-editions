                <p><label type="entry">ABRUZZO</label>, one of the four provinces into which the
                    continental part of the kingdom of Naples, or of the two Sicilies, was formerly
                    divided, but now the name given to three out of the 17 provinces of the later
                    division of that country. It is, with altered boundaries, now distinguished as
                    Abruzzo Ulteriore First, Abruzzo Ulteriore Second, and Abruzzo Citeriore.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abruzzo</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Ulteriore</hi> First, is a
                    maritime province on the Adriatic Sea,»which is its boundary towards the
                    northeast. On the north-west the Papal dominions bound it, on the south-east
                    Abruzzo Citeriore, and on the southwest Abruzzo Ulteriore Second. The western
                    part of the province is very mountainous; the highest crest of the Appenines
                    divides it from Abruzzo Ulteriore Second, and extends towards the sea. The
                    district on the sea-coast is flat, but everywhere else hilly. The valleys
                    between the hills possess a rich soil, well watered by rivulets and brooks in
                    the winter and spring, but which are generally dried up in the summer months.
                    These streams either run into the Pescara, which bounds the province towards
                    Abruzzo Citeriore, or into the Tronto, which is the boundary on the Papal
                    frontier. The extent of the province is 1140 square miles, or 730,600 English
                    acres. The cultivation is badly conducted, and many districts are almost left in
                    a state of natural wildness. The art of irrigation is not understood, nor
                    embankment of the rivers practised, so that the best of the land is often
                    rendered useless. There are owners of two or three hundred acres of land, who
                    scarcely raise sufficient food for their families; and yet the soil, when
                    tolerably managed, will yield 12 grains of wheat for one. The corn most
                    cultivated and preferred is maize. Hemp and flax are raised, but, like corn,
                    merely sufficient for the home supply. Olives, almonds, figs, grapes, and
                    chesnuts, are abundant, as is wood for construction and fuel. The number of
                    inhabitants is 157,339, according to the late census. They are a hardy, bold,
                    idle, and superstitious, race. The most industrious of them stroll yearly into
                    the territories of the Church to work at harvest and in making charcoal, and
                    return home in winter with their wages. The province is divided into two
                    districts, Teramo and Civita di Penne. The city of Teramo is the capital of the
                    province.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abruzzo</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Ulteriore</hi> Second, a
                    province in the continental division of the kingdom of Naples. It is an inland
                    district, bounded on the north by the Papal States, on the north-east by Abruzzo
                    Ulteriore First, on the south-east by Abruzzo Citeriore, on the south by the
                    province Terra di Lavora, and on the west by the States of the Church, The
                    extent is 2210 square miles, or 1,414,400 acres. The whole province is nearly
                    covered with mountains of various heights, one of which, the Grand Casso
                    d’ltalia, near Aquila, is the loftiest peak of the Appenines. There are no
                    plains; but among these mountains some beautiful and fruitful valleys have been
                    formed by the various streams that run through them. None of the rivers are
                    navigable, but all of them have abundance of water, except in the hottest of the
                    summer months. The largest fresh lake of the kingdom is that of Cellano, 14
                    miles long, and 9 broad, surrounded with hills. A canal, built by the Romans to
                    carry off the surplus water, has been long neglected and stopped up, but is now
                    in course of being cleaned and opened. The air is generally temperate, and the
                    sirocco is never felt. The cultivation just suffices to provide sufficient corn
                    for the inhabitants, who, when the maize is dear, make out their subsistence by
                    the help of chesnuts. Olives and vines rarely bring their fruit to full
                    ripeness. Some flax and hemp are raised, and a vast quantity of saffron, which
                    is generally preferred to all other. The sheep produce fine wool when the flocks
                    migrate,.and the flesh is good. The cows·, yield good butter and cheese, which
                    form the chief articles of exportation to the neighbouring provinces. The
                    inhabitants amount to 249,600. Like all mountaineers, they are a strong and
                    active race, and frugal in their habits. The manufactures are insignificant,
                    consisting of some little woollen and linen cloth, some paper, pottery, and
                    wood-ware; but not sufficient of any for the demand of the territory, which is
                    supplied by the exchange of almonds, figs, saffron, wool, butter, and cheese.
                    The chief city is Aquila.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abruzzo</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Citeriore,</hi> a province
                    in the kingdom of Naples. It is bounded on the north-west by Abruzzo Ulteriore
                    First, on the north-east by the Adriatic Sea, on the south-west by the province
                    Molise, and on the west by that of Abruzzo Ulteriore Second. This province is
                    less hilly than the other two Abruzzos, but the Appenines are extended through
                    the south-west part. They, however, gradually decline in height, and extend
                    themselves in wide plains of sand and pebbles. The rivers <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193030381" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0381-0044"/>all run to the Adriatic, and
                    are very deficient in water during the summer months. Agriculture is in a very
                    backward state, and the soil is rather ungrateful when ' labour is bestowed upon
                    it; and the inhabitants prefer the chase and the fishery to it. The corn is
                    sufficient for the population, who grow and consume much more maize and rice
                    than wheat or barley. On the coast some oil and some silk are produced, which,
                    with wine, form the chief export articles. Hemp, flax, liquorice, almonds, and
                    figs, are grown for home consumption. The cattle are more neglected than in the
                    other Abruzzos, though there is excellent pasture both for sheep and cows. There
                    are, however, abundance of swine, goats, and asses. The manufactures are very
                    insignificant. All the exchange of commodities is carried on by land; for though
                    the province has an extensive frontier to the sea, it has no harbour or secure
                    anchoring places. The extent is 1920 square miles, or 1,228,800 acres. The
                    inhabitants are 222,730. There is but one decent road through the province. The
                    capital is Civita di Chicti, formerly called Teti.</p>
