                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">AETOLIA</label>, a country of ancient Greece, comprehending
                    all that tract now called the <hi rend="italic">Despotat,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Little Greece.</hi> It was parted on the east by the river Evanus,
                    now the Fidari, from the Locrenses Ozolae; on the west, from Acarnania, by the
                    Achelous; on the north, it bordered on the country of the Dorians and part of
                    Epirus; and on the south extended to the Bay of Corinth.</p>
                <p>The Aetolians were a restless and turbulent people, seldom at peace among
                    themselves, and ever at war with their neighbours; utter strangers to all sense
                    of friendship or principles of honour; ready to betray their friends upon the
                    least prospect of reaping any advantage from their treachery: in short, they
                    were looked upon by the other states of Greece no otherwise than as outlaws and
                    public robbers. On the other hand, they were bold and enterprising in war;
                    inured to labour and hardships; undaunted in the greatest dangers; jealous
                    defenders of their liberties, for which they were on all occasions willing to
                    venture their lives, and sacrifice all that was most dear to them. They
                    distinguished themselves above all the other nations of Greece in opposing the
                    ambitious designs of the Macedonian princes, who, after having reduced most of
                    the other states, were forced to grant them a peace upon very honourable terms.
                    The constitution of the Aetolian republic was copied from that of the Achaeans,
                    and with a view to form, as it were, a counter-alliance; for the Aetolians bore
                    an irreconcilable hatred to the Achaeans, and had conceived no small jealousy at
                    the growing power of that state. The Cleomenic war, and that of the allies,
                    called the <hi rend="italic">social war,-were</hi> kindled by the Aetolians in
                    the heart of Peloponnesus, with no other view than to humble their antagonists
                    the Achaeans. In the latter they held out, with the assistance only of the
                    Eleans and Lacedemonians, for the space of three years, against the united
                    forces of Achaia and Macedon; but were obliged at last to purchase a peace, by
                    yielding up to Philip all Acarnania. As they parted with this province much
                    against their will, they watched all opportunities<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193032526" xml:id="kp-eb0702-2526-0209"/> of wresting it again out of
                    the Macedonian’s hand; for which reason they entered into an alliance with Rome
                    against him, and proved of great service to the Romans in their war with him;
                    but growing insolent on account of their services, they made war upon the Romans
                    themselves. By that warlike nation they were overcome, and granted a peace on
                    the following severe terms :—1. The majesty of the Roman people shall be revered
                    in all Aetolia. <hi rend="italic">2.</hi> Aetolia shall not suffer the armies of
                    such as are at war with Rome to pass through her territories, and the enemies of
                    Rome shall be likewise the enemies of Aetolia. 3. She shall, in the space of 100
                    days, put into the hands of the magistrates of Corcyra all the prisoners and
                    deserters she has, whether of the Romans or their allies, except such as have
                    been taken twice, or during her alliance with Rome. 4. The Aetolians shall pay
                    down in ready money, to the Roman general· in Aetolia, 200 Euboic talents, of
                    the same value as the Athenian talents, and engage to pay 50 talents more within
                    the six years following. 5. They shall put into the hands of the consul 40 such
                    hostages as he shall choose, none of whom shall be under 12, or above 40 years
                    of age: the pretor, the general of the horse, and such as have been already
                    hostages at Rome, are excepted out of this number. 6. Aetolia shall renounce all
                    pretensions to the cities and territories which the Romans have conquered,
                    though these cities and territories had formerly belonged to the Aetolians. 7.
                    The city of Oenis and its district shall be subject to the Acarnanians.</p>
                <p>After the conquest of Macedon by Aemilius Paulus, they were reduced to a much
                    worse condition; for not only those among them who had openly declared for
                    Perseus, but such as were only suspected to have favoured him in their hearts,
                    were sent to Rome, in order to clear themselves before the senate. There they
                    were detained, and never afterwards suffered to return into their native
                    country. Five hundred and fifty of the chief men of the nation were barbarously
                    assassinated by the partisans of Rome, for no other crime than that of being
                    suspected to wish well to Perseus. The Aetolians appeared before Aemilius Paulus
                    in mourning habits, and made loud complaints of such inhuman treatment, but
                    could obtain no redress; nay, ten commissioners, who had been sent by the senate
                    to settle the affairs of Greece, enacted a decree, declaring that those who were
                    killed had suffered justly, since it appeared to them that they had favoured the
                    Macedonian party. From this time those only were raised to the chief honours and
                    employments in the Aetolian republic who were known to prefer the interest of
                    Rome to that of their country; and as these alone were countenanced at Rome, all
                    the magistrates of Aetolia -were the creatures and mere tools of the Roman
                    senate. In this state of servile subjection they continued till the destruction
                    of Corinth and the dissolution of the Achaean league, when Aetolia, with the
                    other free states of Greece, was reduced to a Roman province, commonly called
                    the <hi rend="italic">province of</hi><hi rend="italic">Achaia.</hi>
                    Nevertheless, each state and city was governed by its own laws, under the
                    superintendency of the pretor whom Rome sent annually into Achaia. The whole
                    nation paid a certain tribute, and the rich were forbidden to possess lands
                    anywhere but in their own country.</p>
                <p>In this state, with little alteration, Aetolia continued under the emperors till
                    the reign of Constantine the Great, who, in his new partition of the provinces
                    of the empire, divided the western parts of Greece from the rest, calling them
                    <hi rend="italic">New Epirus,</hi> and subjecting the whole country to the <hi
                    rend="italic">profectus</hi><hi rend="italic">pr&lt;etorii</hi> for Illyricum.
                    Under the successors of Constantine Greece was parcelled out into several
                    principalities, especially after the taking of Constantinople by the western
                    princes. At that time Theodorus Angelus, a noble Grecian of the imperial family,
                    seized on Aetolia and Epirus. The former he left to Michael his son, who
                    maintained it against Michael Palaeo-logus, the first emperor of the Greeks,
                    after the expulsion of the Latins. Charles, the last prince of this family,
                    dying in 1430 without lawful issue, bequeathed Aetolia to his brother’s son,
                    named also <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Acarnania
                    to his natural sons Memnon, Turnus, and Hercules. But great disputes arising
                    about this division, Amurath II., after the reduction of Thessalonica, laid hold
                    of so favourable an opportunity, and drove them all out in 1432. The Mahometans
                    were afterwards dispossessed of this country by the famous prince of Epirus,
                    George Castriot, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Scanderbeg,</hi> who with a
                    small army opposed the whole power of the Ottoman empire, and defeated these
                    barbarians in 22 pitched battles. That hero at his death left great part of
                    Aetolia to the Venetians; but they not being able to make head against such a
                    mighty power, the whole country was soon reduced by Mohammed II. whose
                    successors hold it to this day.</p>
