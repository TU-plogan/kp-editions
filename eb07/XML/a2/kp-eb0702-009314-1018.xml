                    rend="smallcaps">Achen</hi></label>, a kingdom of Sumatra, in the East Indies,
                    situated on the north-western part of the island, and not extending inland above
                    50 miles to the south-east. It was formerly a flourishing and extensive State,
                    but has now greatly declined from its importance, having become a prey to
                    anarchy, from the contests of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031031"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1031-0094"/>petty chiefs. In 1820 it was bounded, according to
                    the most correct reports, by Tamiang on the eastern, and Smkel on the western
                    coast of Sumatra. Acheen is esteemed comparatively healthy, being more free from
                    woods and swamps than most other portions of the island; and the fevers and
                    dysenteries to .which these are supposed to give occasion, are there said to be
                    uncommon. The soil is light and fertile, and produces a variety of the finest
                    fruits and vegetables; also rice and cotton in great plenty and perfection.
                    Cattle are abundant, and reasonable in price. Though no longer the great mart of
                    eastern commodities, it still carries on a considerable trade with the natives
                    of that part of the coast of Indostan called <hi rend="italic">Tellinga,</hi>
                    who supply it with the cotton goods of their country, and receive in return,
                    gold dust, Sapan wood, betel-nut, patch-leaf, a little pepper, sulphur, camphor,
                    and benzoin. The country is supplied with Bengal opium, and also with iron, and
                    many other articles of merchandise, by the European traders. A manufacture to
                    some extent of a thick species of cotton cloth, and of striped and checked
                    stuffs for the short drawers Worn both by Malays and Achenese, is established
                    here, and meets with an extensive sale. They weave also very handsome silk
                    pieces, of a particular form, for that part of the dress which is called by the
                    Malays <hi rend="italic">cayen serrong.</hi> But this manufacture has of late
                    declined, owing probably to the decay of industry among the inhabitants, and
                    also to the failure in the breed of silk-worms. Gold dust is collected in the
                    mountains near Acheen, but the greater part is brought from the southern ports
                    of Nalaboo and Soosoo. Sulphur is gathered from a volcanic mountain in the
                    neighbourhood, which supplies their own consumption for the manufacture of
                    gunpowder, and admits of a large exportation. Having no convenient coins, though
                    most species of money will be taken here at a valuation, traders commonly make
                    their payments in gold dust, and for that purpose are all provided with scales
                    or small steelyards. They carry their gold about them, wrapped up in pieces of
                    bladder, and often purchase to so small an amount as to make use of grain or
                    seeds for weights. They have besides a thin adulterated gold coin, rudely
                    stamped with Arabic characters, called <hi rend="italic">maas.</hi></p>
                <p>In their persons the Achenese differ from the rest of the Sumatrans, being
                    taller, stouter, and of a darker complexion. They do not appear to be a distinct
                    people, but are thought, with great appearance of reason, to be a mixture of
                    Battas, Malays, and Moors, from the west of India. In their dispositions they
                    are more active and industrious than their neighbours; they possess more
                    penetration and sagacity; have more general knowledge; and, as merchants, they
                    deal upon a more extensive and liberal footing. Their religion is Mahometanism;
                    and having a great number of mosquqs and priests, its forms and ceremonies are
                    strictly observed. They speak a mixed language of Malay and Batta, with all the
                    other jargons used by the eastern Mahomedans. In writing, they use the Malay
                    character.</p>
                <p>The monarchy is hereditary, and the king usually maintains a guard gf 100- sepoys
                    about his palace. When Acheen was,a flourishing state, he ruled with despotic
                    authority. There was, however, according to Mr Marsden, a grand council of the
                    nation, which consisted of the sultan at its head; of four chief counsellors,
                    and eight of a lower degree, who sat on the king’s right hand; and of 16 others
                    who sat on his left. How far this council shares or controls the royal
                    prerogative, does not seem to be ascertained. " At the king’s feet,” says Mr
                    Marsden, “sits a woman, to whom he makes known his pleasure; by her it is
                    communicated to an eunuch, who sits next to her; and by him to an officer, who
                    then proclaims it aloud to the assembly. There are also present two other
                    officers, one of whom has the government of the <hi rend="italic">bazar</hi> or
                    market, and the other the superintending and carrying into execution the
                    punishment of criminals. All matters relative to commerce and the customs of the
                    port come under the jurisdiction of another functionary, who performs the
                    ceremony of giving the <hi rend="italic">cliap</hi> or licence for trade; which
                    is done by lifting a golden-hafted <hi rend="italic">kris</hi> over the head of
                    the merchant who arrives, and without which he dares not to land his goods.
                    Presents, the value of which is become pretty regularly ascertained, are then
                    sent to the king and his officers. If the stranger be in the style of an
                    ambassador, the royal elephants are sent: down to carry him and his letters to
                    the monarch’s presence; these being first delivered into the hands of an eunuch,
                    who places them in a silver dish, covered with rich silk, on the back of the
                    largest elephant, which is provided with a machine for that purpose. Within
                    about an hundred yards of an open hall where the king sits, the cavalcade stops,
                    and the ambassador dismounts, and makes his obeisance by bending his body and
                    lifting his joined hands to his head. When he enters the palace, if an European,
                    he is obliged to take off his shoes; and having made a second obeisance, is
                    seated upon a carpet on the floor, where <hi rend="italic">betel</hi> is brought
                    to him.” The crown revenues, which fluctuate considerably, are derived from
                    import and export duties levied on all goods. Monopolies, the approved resource
                    of despotism, also afford a revenue. These are managed by the officer who has
                    the superintendence of commerce, and who frequently uses his power as an
                    instrument of extortion.</p>
                <p>Acheen, like all states in the same stage of civilisation, is distinguished by
                    the severity of its punishments; and no commutation is admitted, as in the
                    southern countries. But it is on the poor chiefly that the rod of justice falls
                    with its full weight, the nobles being secure from its retribution by the number
                    of their dependents. Petty theft is punished by suspending the criminal from a
                    tree, with a gun or heavy weight tied to his feet; or by cutting off a finger, a
                    hand, or leg, according to the nature of the theft. Many of these mutilated and
                    wretched objects are daily to be seen in the streets. Robbery on the highway and
                    housebreaking are punished by drowning, and afterwards exposing the body on a
                    stake for a few days. If the robbery is committed upon an imaum or priest, the
                    sacrilege is expiated by burning the criminal alive. A man who is convicted of
                    adultery is delivered up to the friends and relations of the injured husband.
                    These discouragements to vice might seem to bespeak a moral and virtuous people;
                    yet all travellers agree in representing the Achenese as one of the most
                    dishonest and flagitious nations of the East.</p>
                <p>Achecn was first visited by Portuguese adventurers in 1509, after they had
                    discovered the passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope. Hostilities
                    immediately commenced with the inhabitants, and continued with various success,
                    until the Portuguese lost Malacca in 1641. About the year 1586 the monarchy of
                    Acheen attained to its greatest height of power and prosperity. It had a
                    flourishing commerce; and the port of Acheen was crowded with vessels from all
                    the Asiatic countries, which were allowed to carry on their trade with the most
                    perfect security. About the year 1600, when the Hutch navigators had penetrated
                    to these, seas, some of thęíŗ. vessels which had entered the port of Acheen were
                    nearly cut off by the treachery of the, inhabitants. It was in 1602 that Acłieen
                    was first visited by the English ships <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031044"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1044-0095"/> under Captain Lancaster, wliere they were well
                    received. In 1607, the reigning sultan, having greatly extended his dominions on
                    every side, assumed the title of sovereign. He had some correspondence with King
                    James; and in answering one of his letters, he takes the title of King of
                    Sumatra, and intimates to the king of England his wish that he would send out to
                    him one of· his countrywomen for a wife. The French visited Acheen in 1621 under
                    Commodore Beaulieu. The Dutch were now become the powerful rivals of the
                    Portuguese in the eastern seas. They succeeded in 1640, by the aid of their
                    allies the Achenese, in wresting from them Malacca, which they had so long
                    maintained. They afterwards commenced their encroachments on the Achenese, and
                    reduced the extent of their ancient dominion, which, joined to the weakness of
                    the government, occasioned the decline of the Achenese power. In 1641, the
                    sultan Peducka Siri, who, though of a cruel disposition, was a powerful
                    sovereign, died; and the Achenese monarchy continued in the female line till
                    1700, when a priest found means to acquire the supreme power. The country was
                    agitated during the whole of the eighteenth century by anarchy, and the most
                    sanguinary revolutions. In 1813, the state of Acheen, formerly so flourishing,
                    was found with hardly any form of civil order existing, every port and village
                    being occupied by petty usurpers, who subsisted by piracy and smuggling. At
                    length the reigning monarch was compelled to abdicate the throne in favour of a
                    shop-keeper’s son in Prince of Wales Island; but he was restored in 1819 to his
                    dignity. In the following year, Mr Sartorius, being deputed to Acheen, found the
                    country in a most miserable state; the king’s authority a mere nullity; and
                    though a commercial treaty had been concluded, there appeared in the distracted
                    state of the country not the least chance of its provisions being carried into
                    effect, without some direct and active interference to uphold the authority of
                    the government.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Acheen,</hi> the capital of the above state, is situated on
                    a river at the north-western extremity of Sumatra, and about a league from the
                    sea, where a road is formed, in which the shipping may be secure under the
                    shelter of several islands. The town is indifferently built of bamboos and rough
                    timber, and raised some feet from the ground on account of the overflow of the
                    river in the rainy season. Its appearance and the nature of the buildings
                    resemble the generality of the Malay bazars, excepting that the superior wealth
                    of this place has occasioned a great number of public edifices, which do not
                    however possess the smallest pretensions to magnificence. The sultan’s palace,
                    which is the chief public building, (s a very rude and uncouth piece of
                    architecture, designed to resist the force of an enemy, and surrounded with a
                    moat and strong walls, but without any regular plan, or any view to the modern
                    system of military attack. Several pieces of ordnance are planted near the gate,
                    some of which are Portuguese; but two were sent, from England by James I., on
                    which the founder’s name and the date are still legible. The river on which the
                    town is situated is not large; and the stream being divided into several
                    channels, is rendered shallow at the bar. In the dry monsoon it will not admit
                    boats of any, burden, much less large vessels, which lie without in the road
                    formed by the islands off the point. The commerce has fallen off. The chief
                    exports are, brimstone, betel-nut, ratans, benzoin, camphor, gold dust, pepper,
                    and horses; the imports, opium, salt, piece-goods, muslin, &amp;c. The town
                    contains about 8000 houses. Long. 95. 45. E. Lat. 5. 35. N. Marsden’s <hi
