                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    >Scanderoon,</hi> a town in Syria, at the extremity of the Mediterranean Sea. It
                    is the port of Aleppo, from which it is distant 28 or 30 leagues. It is now,
                    properly speaking, nothing but a village, without walls, in which the tombs are
                    more numerous than the houses, and which entirely owes its existence to the road
                    which it commands. This is the only road in all Syria where vessels anchor on a
                    solid bottom, without their cables being liable to chafe; but in other respects
                    it has many inconveniences. It is infested during winter by a peculiar wind,
                    called by the French sailors <hi rend="italic">le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Raguier,</hi> which, rushing from the snowy summits of the mountains,
                    frequently forces ships to drag their anchors several leagues; and when the snow
                    begins to cover the mountains which surround the gulf, tempestuous winds arise,
                    which prevent vessels from entering for three or four months together. The road
                    also to Aleppo by the plain is infested by Curd robbers, who conceal themselves
                    in the neighbouring rocks, and frequently attack and plunder the strongest
                    caravans. But the worst circumstance is the extreme unwholesomeness of the air,
                    occasioned here by stagnant waters and mephitic exhalations. It may be affirmed
                    that this every year carries off one-third of the crews of the vessels which
                    remain here during the summer; nay, ships frequently lose all their men in two
                    months. The season for this epidemic disorder is principally from May to the end
                    of September: it is an intermitting fever of the most malignant kind, and is
                    accompanied with obstructions of the liver, which terminate in dropsy. To this
                    baneful epidemic, Alexandretta, from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193035126"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-5126-0409"/>its situation, seems to be irremediably condemned;
                    for the plain on which the town is built is so low and flat, that the rivulets,
                    finding no declivity, can never reach the sea. When they are swelled by the
                    winter rains, the sea, likewise swelled by tempests, hinders their discharging
                    themselves into it; hence their waters, forced to spread themselves, form lakes
                    in the plain. On the approach of the summer the waters become corrupted by the
                    heat, exhale vapours equally corrupt, and which cannot disperse, being confined
                    by the mountains that encircle the gulf. The entrance of the bay, besides, is to
                    the west, which in those countries is the most unhealthful exposure when it lies
                    open to the sea. The labour necessary to remedy this would be immense, and after
                    all insufficient; and, indeed, such an undertaking would be absolutely
                    impossible under a government like that of the Turks. Mr Volney informs us, that
                    the merchants of Aleppo, disgusted with the numerous inconveniences of
                    Alexandretta, wished to abandon that port and carry the trade to Latakia. They
                    proposed to the pacha of Tripoli to repair the harbour at their own expense,
                    provided he would grant them an exemption from all duties for ten years. To
                    induce him to comply with their request, the agent then employed talked much of
                    the advantage which would <hi rend="italic">in time</hi> result to the whole
                    country. “But what signifies it to me what may happen <hi rend="italic">in
                    time</hi><hi rend="italic">?"</hi> replied the pacha; “I was yesterday at
                    Marach; to-morrow, perhaps, I shall be at Djedda. Why should I deprive myself of
                    present advantages, which are certain, for future benefits I cannot hope to
                    partake?” The European factors were obliged therefore to remain at
                    Scanderoon.</p>
