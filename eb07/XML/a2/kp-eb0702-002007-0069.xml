                <p><label type="entry">ABDALLATIF, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Abdollatiph</hi></label>,
                    a celebrated physician and traveller, and one of the most voluminous writers of
                    the East, was born at Bagdad, in the 557th year of the Hegira, being the 1161st
                    of the Christian era. Of the life of this learned person there has fortunately
                    been preserved a memoir, written by himself, together with some additions by a
                    contemporary biographer, named Osaiba. The whole of this curious piece has been
                    translated into French, and published with a work of Abdallatif’s, of which we
                    shall afterwards give some account. Long before the period of his birth, the
                    empire of the Caliphs had begun to decline; but their capital still continued to
                    enjoy those advantages for education which it had originally derived from their
                    liberal patronage of learning and science. Abdallatif was carefully instructed
                    in every branch of knowledge then taught in that renowned city; and the
                    biographical piece just alluded to is not a little interesting, from the
                    glimpses it affords of the studies which engaged the attention of the more
                    aspiring of the Mussulman youth.</p>
                <p>After learning to read, the rules of grammar appear to have been studied with a
                    degree of care and earnestness, which has not perhaps been equalled in any other
                    country. With the study of grammar was joined that of the Koran and the
                    traditionary doctrines, and the whole of the sacred book was carefully committed
                    to memory. This faculty seems, indeed, to have been severely taxed; for it was
                    also thought necessary to be able to repeat several treatises on grammar and
                    jurisprudence, besides some of the choicer collections of Arabian poetry. In
                    these arduous exercises, Abdallatif says that he was for a considerable time
                    accustomed to pass the greater part of the night.</p>
                <p>Having attained to great proficiency in the usual studies, he afterwards applied
                    to the natural philosophy of that day, and to medicine; and with the view of
                    still further improving himself by converse with the learned of other places, he
                    set out, when in his twenty-eighth year, to Mosul in Mesopotamia. Having resided
                    about a year in this city, he next proceeded to Damascus, then a place of great
                    resort to the learned of the surrounding countries. Abdallatif found here many
                    of the most eminent men of that age, part of whom were busied in the chimerical
                    pursuits of the Hermetic art, and part in philological and speculative
                    inquiries. He seems always to have entertained great contempt for the sort of
                    chemistry then in vogue, but he entered with eagerness into speculative
                    discussions; and he at this time composed a treatise upon the Divine essence and
                    attributes, in consequence of some discussions with Alkendi, a philosopher of
                    eminence, who was not, however, thought to be quite orthodox in his faith.</p>
                <p>The active curiosity of Abdallatif was next directed to Egypt; and he accordingly
                    proceeded to Acre, where its sultan, the great Saladin, was at the time
                    encamped, in order to solicit his permission to visit that country. This monarch
                    was a liberal protector of the learned, and fond of their conversation; but
                    having been lately defeated by the crusaders under Richard Coeur de Lion, he was
                    too much occupied with the cares consequent upon this disaster, to admit
                    Abdallatif to the expected honour of a personal interview. He was, however,
                    received in a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030082" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0082-0021"
                    />courteous manner by the Vizier Al Fadhel, whom he found in his tent writing
                    and dictating at the same time to two secretaries; employments which he
                    continued whilst he conversed with his visitor upon sundry points of grammar and
                    philology. Having obtained the necessary credentials from this minister, he
                    proceeded to Cairo; and the munificence which Saladin and his courtiers extended
                    towards the learned, was strikingly exemplified in his reception and treatment
                    in that city. He was provided with a house, with provisions, and money; and the
                    vizier seldom failed to recommend him anew, in those letters of business which
                    he had occasion to write to the governor of the place.</p>
                <p>Here Abdallatif enjoyed the long wished for opportunity of conversing with that
                    <hi rend="italic">Eagle of the Doctors,</hi> as he was called, the celebrated
                    Maimonides, who had been for a considerable time settled in Egypt, and was
                    physician to the sultan. Here, too, he was fortunate enough to meet with a sage,
                    who weaned him of his admiration for the writings of Avicenna, by pointing out
                    the superior value of the ancients. But the philosophers of Grand Cairo were not
                    all of this stamp; for some of them were pretenders to the transmutation of
                    metals, and one boasted that his art enabled him to fabricate a tent of the
                    waters of the Nile. Having passed a considerable time in making various
                    observations and collections in this interesting city, Abdallatif set out for
                    Jerusalem, on learning that he would there see Saladin, who had at length
                    concluded a truce with the crusaders.</p>
                <p>Saladin received him with every mark of respect for his talents, and bestowed
                    upon him a pension. He was then busied in repairing the walls of the Holy City,
                    himself, says Abdallatif, often carrying stones upon his shoulders, to animate
                    the undertaking. But in spite of all his cares and projects, he daily conversed
                    with the learned men whom his bounty had drawn around him. Abdalla-tif mentions,
                    that when first introduced, he found him in the midst of a circle of this
                    description; and he adds, that upon all the various subjects which were
                    discussed, the sultan spoke with the most agreeable address, as well as
                    ingenuity. From Jerusalem, Abdallatif returned to Damascus; and, after a
                    considerable interval, a fresh opportunity having occurred of revisiting Egypt,
                    he again proceeded to Cairo, where he taught medicine and philosophy for several
                    years.</p>
                <p>During this period, Egypt was visited with a terrible famine and pestilence, of
                    which, and the horrors and crimes which ensued, he has given a most appalling
                    description in the two last chapters of his Account of this country. Human
                    nature was scarcely ever presented to observation under so hideous an aspect;
                    the wretched Egyptians were driven, not only to feed upon the bodies of those
                    who had fallen victims to Avant or disease, but to seize upon children, whom
                    they killed and devoured; and Abdallatif asserts, that they thus came to acquire
                    such a relish for those inhuman repasts, that they with difficulty refrained
                    from them after the famine had subsided. It was likewise during his second stay
                    in Egypt that he witnessed an insane attempt to pull down the Pyramids; a
                    project to which the reigning sultan (a son of Saladin’s, who, after his death,
                    succeeded to this part of his dominions) had been instigated by some of his
                    favourites, and in which he persisted for eight months, without being able to
                    make any sensible impression upon these indestructible monuments of the ancient
                    world.</p>
                <p>About the year 1207, Abdallatif left Egypt for his former residence, Damascus;
                    and here he for some time practised as a physician, and lectured upon medicine
                    with great success. But his love of new scenes, and desire of extending his
                    knowledge and fame, still urged him to travel ; and he seems to have passed the
                    rest of his life in Aleppo, and various parts of Armenia and-Asia Minor,
                    acquiring both wealth and glory by his abilities as a physician and an author.
                    Having returned to his native city, purposing to present some of his works to
                    the caliph, and then to set out on a pilgrimage to Mecca, he was seized with
                    illness soon after his arrival, and died -there in the year 1231.</p>
                <p>He was undoubtedly a person of great knowledge, and of an ardent, inquisitive,
                    and penetrating mind. According to his Arabian biographer, to whom*he was well
                    known, he showed himself, in conversation, somewhat vain of his own attainments;
                    and was accustomed to speak rather scornfully of most of his contemporaries. But
                    it ought to be mentioned, to the credit of his understanding, that his derision
                    seems partly to have flowed from his contempt of those chemical fooleries to
                    which they were so much addicted, that, to use the words of Gibbon, “the reason
                    and the fortune of thousands were evaporated in the crucibles of Alchemy.”</p>
                <p>Of that long list of treatises on medicine, philosophy, and literature, which
                    Osaiba has appended to the account of Abdallatif’s life, one only has found its
                    way into Europe; nor do any of the others appear to be known at this day in the
                    East. The work here alluded to is his <hi rend="italic">Account of Egypt,</hi>
                    which was fortunately discovered and brought to this country by our celebrated
                    orientalist Pococke. The manuscript, which is a very old one, is still preserved
                    in the Bodleian Library. Of this work, an elegant edition, with a Latin
                    translation, notes, and a life of Abdallatif, was published in 1800, by Dr
                    White, professor of Arabic in the University of <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi>
                    Oxford. A French translation, with enlarged notes, was published at Paris in
                    1810, by Μ. Silvestre de Sacy; and to this, among other valuable illustrations,
                    is appended a translation from an Arabic manuscript, of the curious biographical
                    memoir to which we have above alluded.</p>
                <p>This account of Egypt consists of two books; the first of which, in six chapters,
                    gives a general view of the country, of its plants, animals, antiquities,
                    buildings, and modes of navigating on the Nile; and the second, in three
                    chapters, treats at large of this river, and of that terrible famine already
                    mentioned, which was occasioned by a failure in the usual annual increase of its
                    waters. The book undoubtedly is, upon the whole, one of the most interesting
                    productions which has come to us from the East; inasmuch as it presents us with
                    a detailed and authentic view of the state of Egypt during the middle ages, and
                    thus supplies a link which was wanting between the accounts of ancient and of
                    modern times.</p>
