                    superior of a monastery of monks erected into an abbey or priory</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">Abbot</hi> is originally Hebrew, where it signifies
                    <hi rend="italic">father.</hi> The Jews call <hi rend="italic">father,</hi> in
                    their language, <hi rend="italic">Ab</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whence the
                    Chaldeans and Syrians formed <hi rend="italic">Abba</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    thence the Greeks ACCag, which the Latins retained; and hence our <hi
                    rend="italic">Abbot,</hi> the French <hi rend="italic">Abbe,</hi> &amp;c. St
                    Mark and St Paul use the Syriac <hi rend="italic">Abba</hi> in their Greek, by
                    reason it was then commonly known in the synagogues and the primitive assemblies
                    of the Christians; adding to it, by way of interpretation, the word <hi
                    rend="italic">father,</hi> ACCa ò <hi rend="italic">πaτr</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">ν,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> Abba, father
                    <hi rend="italic">q. d.</hi> Abba, that is to say, Father. But the name Ab, or
                    Abba, which at first was a term of tenderness and affection, became at length a
                    title of dignity and honour. The Jewish doctors affected it; and one of their
                    most ancient books, containing the sayings or apophthegms of divers of them, is
                    entitled Pirke <hi rend="italic">Abboth</hi> or Avoth; «. <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.</hi> Chapters of the Fathers. It was in allusion to this affectation, that
                    Jesus Christ forbade his disciples to call any man their father on earth; which
                    word St Jerome turns against the superiors of the monasteries of his time, for
                    assuming the titles of <hi rend="italic">Abbots,</hi> or Fathers.</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">Abbot,</hi> then, appears as old as the institution of
                    monks itself. The governors of the primitive monasteries assumed indifferently
                    the titles <hi rend="italic">Abbots</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archimandrites.</hi> They were really distinguished from the clergy; though
                    frequently confounded with them, because a degree above laymen.</p>
                <p>In those early days, the abbots were subject to the bishops and the ordinary
                    pastors. Their monasteries being remote from cities, built in the farthest
                    solitudes, they <pb break="no" facs="nls:193029991" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9991-0014"
                    />had no share in ecclesiastical affairs. They went on Sundays to the parish
                    church with the rest of the people; or, if they were too remote, a priest was
                    sent them to administer the sacraments; till at length they were allowed to have
                    priests of their own body. The abbot or archimandrite himself was usually the
                    priest: but his function extended no farther than to the spiritual assistance'
                    of his monastery; and he remained still in obedience to the bishop. There being
                    among the abbots several persons of learning, they made a vigorous opposition to
                    the rising heresies of those times; which first occasioned the bishops to call
                    them out of their deserts, and fix them about the suburbs of cities, and at
                    length in the cities themselves; from which era their degeneracy is to be dated.
                    Then the abbots threw off their former plainness and simplicity, assumed the
                    rank of prelates, aspired at being independent of the bishops, and grasped at so
                    much power, that severe laws were made against them at the council of Chalcedon.
                    Many of them, however, carried the point of independency, obtained the
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">lord,</hi> and were distinguished by other
                    badges of the episcopate, particularly the mitre.</p>
                <p>Hence arose new distinctions between the abbots. Those were termed <hi
                    rend="italic">mitred</hi> abbots, who were privileged to wear the mitre, and
                    exercise episcopal authority within their respective precincts; being exempted
                    from the jurisdiction of the bishop. Others were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >crosiered</hi> abbots, from their bearing the crosier or pastoral staff. Others
                    were styled <hi rend="italic">ecumenical</hi> or universal abbots, in imitation
                    of the patriarch of Constantinople: while others were termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >cardinal</hi> abbots, from their superiority over all other abbots. In Britain,
                    the mitred abbots were lords of parliament, and called abbots-sovereign, and
                    abbots-general, to distinguish them from the other abbots. And as there were
                    lords-abbots, so there were also lords-priors, who had exempt jurisdiction, and
                    were likewise lords of parliament.</p>
                <p>In Roman Catholic countries, the principal distinctions observed between abbots
                    are those of <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >commendatory.</hi> The former take the vow and wear the habit of their order;
                    whereas the latter are seculars who have received tonsure, but are obliged by
                    their bulls to take orders when of proper age.</p>
                <p>Anciently the ceremony of creating an abbot consisted in clothing him with the
                    habit called <hi rend="italic">cuculus,</hi> or cowl; putting the pastoral staff
                    into his hand, and the shoes called <hi rend="italic">pedales</hi> on his feet:
                    but at present, it is only a simple benediction, improperly called, by some,
                    consecration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abbot</hi> is also a title given to others beside the
                    superiors of monasteries: thus bishops whose sees were formerly abbeys, are
                    called abbots. Among the Genoese, the chief magistrate of the republic formerly
                    bore the title of <hi rend="italic">abbot</hi> of the people.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abbot,</hi><hi rend="italic">George,</hi> archbishop of
                    Canterbury, was born October 29. 1562, at Guildford in Surrey. He was the son of
                    Maurice Abbot, a cloth-worker. He studied at Oxford, and in 1597 was chosen
                    principal of University college. In 1599, he was installed dean of Winchester:
                    the year following he was chosen vice-chancellor of the university of Oxford,
                    and a second time in 1603. In 1604, the translation of the Bible now in use was
                    begun by the direction of King James; and Dr Abbot was the second of eight
                    divines of Oxford, to whom the care of translating the whole New Testament
                    (excepting the Epistles) was committed. The year following, he was a third time
                    vice-chancellor. In 1608, he went to Scotland with George Hume earl of Dunbar,
                    to assist in establishing an union between the,churches of Scotland and England;
                    and in this business he conducted himself with so much address and prudence,
                    that it laid the foundation of all his future preferment. King James ever after
                    paid great deference to his advice and counsel; and upon the death of Dr
                    Overton, bishop of Litchfield and Coventry, he named Dr Abbot for his successor,
                    who was accordingly constituted bishop of those two united sees in December
                    1609. About a month afterwards he was translated to the see of London, and on
                    the second of November following was raised to the archiepiscopal see..</p>
                <p>It is not however improbable, that his extravagant adulation of his royal master,
                    in which he went as far as any other court chaplain could do, contributed not a
                    little to his rapid preferment. In the preface to a pamphlet which he published,
                    the following specimen of ridiculous flattery occurs: Speaking of the king, he
                    says, “whose life hath been so immaculate and unspotted, &amp;c. that even
                    malice itself, which leaves nothing unsearched, could never find true blemish in
                    it, nor cast probable aspersion on it.—Zealous as a David; learned and wise, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Solomon</hi> of our age; religious as Josias; careful of
                    spreading Christ’s faith as Constantine the Great; just as Moses; undefiled in
                    all his ways as a Jehoshaphat and Hezekiah; full of clemency as another
                    Theodosius.”—Yet, as we shall immediately see, Abbot could sometimes oppose the
                    will of the sovereign with courage and constancy.</p>
                <p>His great zeal for the Protestant religion made him a strenuous promoter of the
                    match between the Elector Palatine and the Princess Elizabeth; which was
                    accordingly concluded and solemnized the 14th of February 1612, the archbishop
                    performing the ceremony on a stage erected in the royal chapel. In the following
                    year happened the famous case of divorce between the lady Frances Howard,
                    daughter of the earl of Suffolk, and Robert earl of Essex; which has been
                    considered as one of the greatest blemishes of King James’s reign. The part
                    which the archbishop took in the business added much to the reputation he had
                    already acquired for incorruptible integrity. It was referred by the king to a
                    court of delegates, whose opinion the king and court wished and expected to be
                    favourable to the divorce. But the archbishop, unawed by royal authority, with
                    inflexible firmness resisted it, and published his reasons for persisting in his
                    opinion; to which the king, disappointed in his views, thought fit to reply:
                    Sentence was given in the lady’s favour. In 1618, the king published a
                    declaration, which he ordered to be read in all churches, permitting sports and
                    pastimes on the Lord’s day: this gave great uneasiness to the archbishop, who
                    happening to be at Croydon on the day it was ordered to be read, had the courage
                    to forbid it.</p>
                <p>Being now in a declining state of health, the archbishop used in the summer to go
                    to Hampshire for the sake of recreation; and being invited by Lord Zouch to hunt
                    in his park at Bramzill, he met there with the greatest misfortune that ever
                    befell him; for he accidentally killed the game-keeper by an arrow from a
                    cross-bow which he shot at one of the deer. This fatal accident threw him into a
                    deep melancholy; and he ever afterwards kept a monthly fast on Tuesday, the day
                    on which it happened; and he settled an annuity of L.20 on the widow.<note

                    >Church Hist.</hi> cent. xxvii. p. 87.</p></note> Advantage was taken of this
                    misfortune, to lessen him in the king’s favour; but, his majesty said, “An angel
                    might have miscarried in this sort.” His enemies alleging that he had incurred
                    an irregularity, and was thereby incapacitated for performing the offices of a
                    primate, the king directed a commission to ten persons to inquire into this
                    matter. The result was not satisfactory to his Grace’s enemies; it being
                    declared, that, as the murder was involuntary, he had not forfeited his
                    archiepiscopal character.</p>
                <p>The archbishop after this seldom assisted at the council, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193030004" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0004-0015"/>being chiefly hindered by his
                    infirmities; but in the king’s last illness he was sent for, and constantly
                    attended till his majesty expired on the 27th of March 1622. He performed the
                    ceremony of the coronation of King Charles I. though very infirm and distressed
                    with the gout. He was never greatly in this king’s favour; and the duke of
                    Buckingham being his declared enemy, watched an opportunity of making him feel
                    the weight of his displeasure. This he at last accomplished, upon the
                    archbishop’s refusing to license a sermon, preached by Dr Sibthorpe to justify a
                    loan which the king had demanded, and pregnant with principles which tended to
                    overthrow the constitution. The archbishop was immediately after suspended from
                    all his functions as primate; and they were exercised by certain bishops
                    commissioned by the king, of whom Laud, the archbishop’s enemy, and afterwards
                    his successor, was one; while the only cause assigned for this procedure was,
                    that the archbishop could not at that time personally attend those services
                    which were otherwise proper for his cognizance and direction. He did not,
                    however, remain long in this situation; for a parliament being absolutely
                    necessary, his Grace was sent for, and restored to his authority and
                    jurisdiction. But not proving friendly to certain rigorous measures adopted by
                    the prevailing church party, headed by Laud, whose power and interest at court
                    were now very considerable, his presence became unwelcome there; so that, upon
                    the birth of the prince of Wales, afterwards Charles II., Laud had the honour to
                    baptize him, as dean of the chapel. The archbishop being worn out with cares and
                    infirmities, died at Croydon, the 5th of August 1633, aged 71 years; and was
                    buried at Guildford, the place of his nativity, where he had endowed an hospital
                    with lands to the amount of L.300 per annum. A stately monument was erected over
                    the grave, with his cffigy in his robes.</p>
                <p>He proved himself, in most circumstances of his life, to be a man of great
                    moderation to all parties; and was desirous that the clergy should gain the
                    respect of the laity by the sanctity and purity of their manners, rather than
                    claim it as due to their function. His opinions and principles, however, have
                    drawn upon him many severe reflections; particularly from the earl of Clarendon.
                    But Dr Welwood has done more justice to his merit and abilities.<note

                    the former, was born at Guildford in 1560, and completed his studies at Baliol
                    college, Oxford. In 1582, he took his degree of master of arts, and soon became
                    a celebrated preacher; and to this talent he chiefly owed his preferment. Upon
                    the first sermon at Worcester, he was chosen lecturer in that city, and soon
                    after rector of All-saints in the same place. In 1597, he took his degree of
                    doctor in divinity: and, in the beginning of King James’s reign, was appointed
                    chaplain in ordinary to his majesty; who had such an opinion of him as a writer,
                    that he ordered the doctor’s book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Antichristo</hi> to be printed, with his own commentary upon part of the
                    Apocalypse. In 1609, he was elected master of Baliol college; which trust he
                    discharged with the utmost care and assiduity, by his frequent lectures to the
                    scholars, by his continual presence at public exercises, and by promoting
                    temperance in the society. In November 1610, he was made prebendary of Normanton
                    in the church of Southwell; and, in 1612, his majesty appointed him regius
                    professor of divinity at Oxford. The fame of his lectures became very great; and
                    those which he gave upon the supreme power of kings, against Bellarmine and
                    Suarez, so much pleased his majesty, that when the see of Salisbury became
                    vacant, he named him to that bishopric, and he was consecrated by his own
                    brother at Lambeth, December 3. 1615. When he came to Salisbury, he found the
                    cathedral falling to decay, through the avarice and negligence of the clergy
                    belonging to it; however, he found means to draw five hundred pounds from the
                    prebendaries, which he applied towards repairing it. Here he devoted himself to
                    the duties of his function with great diligence and assiduity, visiting his
                    whole diocese in person, and preaching every Sunday. But his sedentary life, and
                    close application to study, brought upon him the gravel and stone; of which he
                    died on the 2d of March 1618, in the 58th year of his age; having filled the sec
                    only two years and three months. He wrote, 1. The Mirror of Popish Subtleties.
