                    Arrian calls it <hi rend="italic">a place,</hi> not a city, in which stood the
                    temple of Jupiter Ammon, entirely surrounded by sandy wastes. Pliny states, that
                    the oracle of Ammon was 12 days’ journey from Memphis, and among the <hi

                    rend="italic">Ammoniacus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Diodorus Siculus, that the
                    district where the temple stood, though surrounded with deserts, was watered by
                    dews which fell nowhere else in all that country. It was agreeably adorned with
                    fruitful trees and springs, and full of villages. In the middle stood the
                    Acropolis or citadel, encompassed with a triple wall; the first and inmost of
                    which contained the palace; the others the apartments of the women, the
                    relations, and children, as also the temple of the god, and the sacred fountains
                    for lustrations. Without the Acropolis stood, at no great distance, another
                    temple of Ammon, shaded by a number of tall trees; near which there was a
                    fountain, called that of the sun, or <hi rend="italic">Solis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fons,</hi> because subject to extraordinary changes according to
                    the time of the day; morning and evening warm, at noon cold, at midnight
                    extremely hot. A kind of fossil salt was said to be naturally produced here. It
                    was dug out of the earth in large oblong pieces, transparent as crystal. It was
                    thought to be a present worthy of kings, and used by the Egyptians in their
                    sacrifices. From this our sal-ammoniac has taken its name. The observations of
                    Brown and Hornemann prove that the oasis of Siwah is the district in which this
                    celebrated oracle was situated. Pliny places it at 12 days’ journey from
                    Memphis, and Hornemann reached Siwah in 12 days from Cairo. These travellers
                    found an old building 32 feet long, 15 broad, and 18 high, formed of large
                    stones, and with some hieroglyphics upon it. This is most probably the ancient
                    sanctuary of Jupiter, which was placed in an inclosure, and surrounded by an
                    outer wall. Near this old building is a spring, which still preserves, in
                    popular opinion, the qualities attributed by the ancients to the Fountain of the
                    Sun, and which in fact belong to all deep-seated cold springs: it is said to be
                    warm in the night and cold in the day. Our modern travellers found also the salt
                    incrustations, the numerous date-trees, and the sea-shells and fossil wood in
                    the neighbouring desert, which Strabo and other old writers notice. Arrian and
                    Diodorus describe the district as having a breadth of 40 or 50 stadia, with
                    which Brown’s estimate of 4 to 6 English miles nearly agrees. Hornemann makes
                    the circumference 50 miles, but he includes some patches of habitable land near
                    it, but not continuous with it. Siwah is inhabited by a considerable number of
                    people, who are Mahometans.</p>

                    worshipped under the figure of a ram. Bacchus having subdued Asia, and passing
                    with his army through the deserts of Africa, was in great want of water; but
                    Jupiter, his father, assuming the shape of a ram, led him to a fountain, where
                    he refreshed himself and his army; in gratitude for which favour, Bacchus built
                    there a temple to Jupiter, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Ammon,</hi> from
                    the Greek <hi rend="italic">auμος,</hi> which signifies <hi rend="italic"

                    sent by Pope Leo X. to England, in the characters of prothonotary of the
                    apostolic see, and collector-general of that kingdom. He was a man of singular
                    genius and learning, and soon became acquainted with the principal literati of
                    those times; particularly with Erasmus, Colet, and others, for the sake of whose
                    company he resided some time at Oxford. The advice which Erasmus gives him, in
                    regard to pushing <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038376"

                    was certainly intended as a satire on the artful methods generally practised by
                    the selfish and ambitious part of mankind. “In the first place,” says he, “throw
                    off all sense of shame; thrust yourself into every one’s business, and elbow out
                    whomsoever you can; neither love nor hate any one; measure every thing by your
                    own advantage; let this be the scope and drift of all your actions. Give nothing
                    but what is to be returned with usury, and be complaisant to every body. Have
                    always two strings to your bow. Feign that you are solicited by many from
                    abroad, and get every thing ready for your departure. Show letters inviting you
                    elsewhere, with great promises.” Ammon was Latin secretary to Henry VIII., but
                    at what time he was appointed does not appear. In 1512 he was made canon and
                    prebendary of the collegiate chapel of St Stephen, in the palace of Westminster.
                    He was likewise prebendary of Wells; and in 1514 was presented to the rectory of
                    Dychial in that diocese. About the same time, by the king’s special
                    recommendation, he was also made prebendary of Salisbury. He died in the year
                    1517, and was buried in St Stephen’s chapel in the palace of Westminster. He was
                    esteemed an elegant Latin writer, and an admirable poet. The epistles of Erasmus
                    to Ammon abound with encomiums on his genius and learning. His works are, 1.
