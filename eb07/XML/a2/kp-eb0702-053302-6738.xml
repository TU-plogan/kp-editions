                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ALMANSOR</label> the Victorious, the second caliph of the
                    house of Al Abbas, succeeded his brother Abul Abbas Al Saffah in the year 753,
                    of the Hegira 136, and in the following year was inaugurated at Al Hashemiyah.
                    Although Al Saffah had declared him presumptive heir of the crown, and he had
                    been proclaimed caliph in the imperial city of Anbar, yet immediately upon his
                    inauguration his uncle Abdallah ebn Ali had sufficient interest to cause himself
                    to be proclaimed caliph at Damascus. In Arabia, Syria, and Mesopotamia, he
                    collected a numerous army, and arrived at the banks of the Masius, near Nisibis,
                    where he encamped, ready to dispute his royal accession by arms. Almansor
                    collected an immense army in Persia, Chorasan, and Irak, and gave the command of
                    it to Abu Moslem, who harassed his uncle’s troops for five months, and at last
                    totally defeated him, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 754. Notwithstanding the
                    services which Abu Moslem had rendered to the family of Al Abbas, after this
                    victory he became an object of jealousy, and was assassinated in the presence of
                    Al-mansor himself, by his express order. After the death of Abu Moslem, the
                    standard of rebellion was raised by Simon, a Magian, who seized on the treasures
                    of the deceased governor of Chorasan, and excited the people of that country to
                    a general revolt; but this insurrection was suddenly quelled by the general of
                    Almansor, Jamhur ebn Morad. The caliph avariciously seized the spoils of this
                    victory, which so incensed Jamhur that he immediately turned his arms against
                    his royal master; but he was soon defeated by the caliph’s forces. The patriarch
                    of Antioch was about this time detected in an illicit correspondence with the
                    Grecian emperor, and consequently was banished into an obscure part of
                    Palestine; and in the mean time the Christians in the dominions of the caliph
                    were prohibited from building or repairing any churches, and also were laid
                    under several other severe restraints.</p>
                <p>Almansor sent a large army into Cappadocia in the year 757, fortified the city of
                    Malatia or Melitene, and deposited in it a great part of his treasures. But in
                    this year he was attacked by a sect of believers in the metempsychosis, called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Rawandians.</hi> This sect assembled at Al Hashemiyah, the
                    residence of the caliph, and, by the ceremony of going in procession round his
                    palace, intimated their purpose of invoking him as a deity, and paying him
                    divine homage. Incensed by their impiety, the caliph ordered several of these
                    sectaries to be imprisoned, which roused their resentment, and led them to form
                    the design of his assassination. The generous interposition of Maan ebn Zaidet,
                    an Ommiyan chief, who had been under the necessity of concealing himself from
                    the caliph’s resentment, however, defeated their intention. This insult,
                    received in his capital, induced him to build the city of Bagdad, and to fix his
                    residence there, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 762. In the preceding year a
                    plan was formed to dethrone him; but it being discovered, he severely punished
                    all who were either directly or indirectly concerned in it. He set out on a
                    pilgrimage to Mecca in the year 774, and being seized on the road with a
                    dangerous disease, he sent for his son and intended successor Al Mohdi, and gave
                    him some salutary advice. “I command you,” said he, “to treat publicly your
                    relations with the greatest marks of distinction, since this conduct will
                    reflect no small degree of honour and glory upon yourself. Increase the number
                    of your freedmen, and treat them with all kindness, as they will be of great
                    service to you in your adversity; but neither this nor the other injunction will
                    you fulfil. Enlarge not that part of your capital erected on the eastern bank of
                    the Tigris, as you will never be able to finish it; but this work I know you
                    will attempt. Never permit any of your women to intermeddle in affairs of state,
                    or to have any influence over your councils; but this advice I know you will not
                    take. These are my last commands; or, if you please, my dying advice; and to God
                    I now recommend you.” In parting they both gave vent to their feelings in a
                    flood of tears. He pursued his journey to Bir-Maimun, <hi rend="italic">i.
                    e.</hi> the well of Maimun, where he died in the 63d year of his age and 20th of
                    his reign. His remains were interred at Mecca.</p>
