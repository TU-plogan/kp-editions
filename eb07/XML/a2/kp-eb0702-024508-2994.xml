                <p><label type="entry">AGIS</label>, king of Lacedemon, was descended from Agesilaus
                    II. in a right line. He projected the reformation of his kingdom, by the
                    restoring of the laws of Lycurgus; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193033007"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-3007-0246"/>but he fell under the weight of an enterprise that
                    could not but be disagreeable to all those who had great possessions, and had
                    been long accustomed to the sweets of a voluptuous life. Agis, being in the
                    flower of his age, and having a very refined desire of glory, practised the
                    ancient discipline first in his own person. His clothes and his table were
                    according to the manners of former times; which is so much the more to be
                    admired, because Agesistrata, his mother, and Archidamia,his grandmother,had
                    brought him up voluptuously. When he sounded the people’s minds, he found that
                    the younger sort opposed his project less than those who had enjoyed a
                    relaxation of discipline several years. The greatest difficulty was expected to
                    arise from the women. They had at that time more credit than ever; for their
                    power is never greater than when luxury is in fashion. Agis’s mother did not at
                    all relish the proposed reformation. She must have lost her riches, which gave
                    her a share in a thousand sorts of intrigues; so she opposed the design at once,
                    and treated it as a chimera. But her brother Agesilaus, whom Agis had engaged in
                    his interests, knew how to manage her in such a manner, that she promised to
                    second the enterprise. She endeavoured to gain the women; but instead of
                    suffering themselves to be persuaded, they applied to Leonidas, the other king
                    of Lacedemon, and humbly besought him to frustrate the designs of his colleague.
                    Leonidas durst not oppose it openly, for fear of irritating the people, to whom
                    the reformation was -agreeable, because they found their account in it. He
                    contented himself with countermining it by intrigues, and sowing suspicions as
                    if Agis had aspired to tyranny, by pulling down the rich and raising the poor.
                    Agis did not fail to propose his new laws to the senate, relating to the
                    discharge of debts, and a new division of the lands. Leonidas, being supported
                    by the rich, opposed this project so strongly that there was one voice more
                    against it than for it. He paid dear for his success in this affair. Lysander,
                    one of the ephori, who had been the grand promoter of the reformation, caused
                    certain accusations to be preferred against him; using, at the same time, some
                    expedients to make him an object of superstitious dislike. Leonidas, being
                    frightened, took refuge in the temple of Minerva. He was summoned, and because
                    he did not appear, he was degraded from his dignity, which was conferred on his
                    son-in-law Cleombrotus. He obtained leave to retire to Tegaea. The new ephori
                    had Lysander and Mandroclidas tried for innovation: these persuaded the two
                    kings to unite and turn out diese ephori. The thing was brought about, but not
                    without a great tumult in the city. Agesilaus, one of the ephori that succeeded
                    those that were just turned out, would have caused Leonidas to be killed on the
                    way to Tegaea, if Agis had not sent him a strong guard. The reformation might
                    then have been established, if Agesilaus had not found means to elude the good
                    intentions of the two kings. Whilst this was transacting, the Achaians asked
                    assistance, which was given them; and Agis had the command of the troops. He
                    acquired a good deal of reputation in this campaign. At his return, he found his
                    affairs so embroiled by the ill conduct of Agesilaus, that it was impossible for
                    him to maintain himself. Leonidas was recalled to Lacedemon: Agis retired into
                    one temple, and Cleombrotus into another. The wife of the latter behaved herself
                    in such a manner that.,she became the admiration of every body. Leonidas was
                    contented with banishing his .son-in-law; after which he applied himself
                    entirely to the ruin of Agis. One of the ephori, who had no mind to return what
                    Agesistrata, the mother of Agis, had lent him, was the principal instrument of
                    the misfortune of this family. Agis never went out of his sanctuary but to
                    bathe. One day, as he was returning from thence to the temple, he was seized by
                    that ephorus and carried to prison. Then he was brought to his trial, condemned
                    to death, and delivered to the executioner. His mother and grandmother used all
                    the entreaty and importunity imaginable, that, as he was king of Lacedemon, he
                    might at least be permitted to plead his cause before the people. But they were
                    apprehensive lest his words would make too great an impression, and therefore
                    they ordered him to be strangled that very hour. The ephorus who was in debt to
                    Agesistrata permitted that princess to go into the prison; which he granted
                    likewise to Agis’s grandmother; but he gave orders to strangle them one after
                    another. Agesis-trata died in a manner that was extremely to her honour. The
                    wife of Agis, who was a princess of great fortune and prudence, was forced away
                    from her apartment by King Leonidas, and obliged to marry his son Cleomenes, who
                    was then very young.</p>
