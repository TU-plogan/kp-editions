                <p><label type="entry">ABRAHAM</label>, the father and stock whence the faithful
                    sprung, was the son of Terah. He was descended from Noah by Shem, from whom he
                    was nine degrees removed. Some fix his birth in the 130th year of Terah’s age,
                    but others place it in his father’s 70th year. It is highly probable he was born
                    in the city of Ur, in Chaldea, which he and his father left when they went to
                    Canaan, where they remained till the death of Terah; after which, Abraham
                    resumed his first design of going to Palestine. The Scriptures mention the
                    several places he stopped at in Canaan; his journey into Egypt, where his wife
                    was carried off from him; his going into Gerar, where Sarah was again taken from
                    him, but restored as before; the victory he obtained over the four kings who had
                    plundered Sodom; his compliance with his wife, who insisted that he should make
                    use of their maid Hagar in order to raise up children; the covenant God made
                    with him, sealed with the ceremony of circumcision; his obedience to the command
                    of God, who ordered him to offer up his only son as a sacrifice, and how this
                    bloody act was prevented; his marriage with Keturah; his death at the age of 175
                    years; and his interment in the cave of Machpelah, near the body of Sarah his
                    first wife.</p>
                <p>Abraham is said to have been well skilled in many sciences, and to have written
                    several books. Josephus<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Αntiq. lib. i. cap. 7, 8.</p></note> tells us that he taught the Egyptians
                    arithmetic and geometry; and according to Eupolemus and Artapan, he instructed
                    the Phoenicians, as well as the Egyptians, in astronomy. A work which treats of
                    the creation has been long ascribed to him: it is mentioned in the Talmud,<note

                    Hoschia used to read it on the eve before the Sabbath. In the first ages of
                    Christianity, according to St Epiphanius,<note anchored="true" place="margin"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Advers. Hoer.</hi> p. 286.</p></note> an
                    heretical sect, called <hi rend="italic">Sethinians,</hi> dispersed a piece
                    which had the title of <hi rend="italic">Abraham’s Revelation.</hi> Origen
                    mentions also a treatise supposed to have been written by this patriarch. The
                    book on the creation was printed at Paris in 1552, and translated into Latin by
                    Postel: Rittangel, a converted Jew, and professor at Königsberg, gave also a
                    Latin translation of it, with remarks, in 1642.</p>

                    rabbi, in the 13th century, who professed astrology, and assumed the character
                    of a prophet. He pretended to predict the coming of the Messiah, which was to
                    happen in the year 1358; but fortunately he died in 1303, fifty-five years
                    before the time when the prediction was to be fulfilled. He wrote a book, <hi

                    first edition, which is most valuable, is marked with stars at certain words,
                    which are designed to show that these words are difficult to be understood in
                    the Hebrew, and that they may be used in a different sense.</p>
