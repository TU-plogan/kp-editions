                <p><label type="entry">AMBROSIUS <hi rend="smallcaps">Aurelianus</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Aurelius Ambrosius</hi></label>, a famous general of the
                    ancient Britons, of Roman extraction. He was educated at the court of Aldroen of
                    Armorica, who, at the request of the Britons, sent him over with 10,000 men to
                    assist them against the Saxons, whom Vortigern had invited into Britain.
                    Ambrosius was so successful against the Saxons, that the Britons chose him for
                    their king, and compelled Vortigern to surrender to him all the western part of
                    the kingdom, divided by the Roman highway now called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Watling-street.</hi> Some time after, the Britons being discontented with
                    Vortigern, and having withdrawn their allegiance from him, he retired to a
                    castle in Wales, where, being besieged by Ambrosius, and the castle taking fire,
                    he perished in the flames, and left his rival sole monarch of Britain, who now
                    assumed the imperial purple, after the manner of the Roman emperors. Geoffrey of
                    Monmouth tells us that Ambrosius built Stonehenge, near Salisbury, in Wiltshire.
                    Ambrosius, according to this historian, coming to a monastery near Caercaradoc,
                    now Salisbury, where 300 British lords, massacred by Hengist, lay buried, and
                    resolving to perpetuate the memory of this action, he ordered his workmen to
                    prepare a large quantity of stones and other materials. But having, at the
                    instigation of Tremounus, Archbishop of Caerleon, consulted the famous Merlin,
                    this magician advised him to send over to Ireland for certain great stones,
                    called <hi rend="italic">chorea gigantum,</hi> the giant’s dance, placed in a
                    circle on a hill called <hi rend="italic">Killair,</hi> which were brought
                    thither by giants from the farthest borders of Africa. A body of forces was
                    accordingly sent into Ireland, under Pendragon, Ambrosius’s brother, to fetch
                    these stones; but they were opposed in their attempt by Gilliomanus, king of the
                    country, who derided the folly of the Britons in undertaking so ridiculous an
                    expedition. Nevertheless the Britons, having vanquished this prince in battle,
                    brought away the stones; and by the direction and assistance of Merlin, who had
                    accompanied them, these wonderful stones, by order of Ambrosius, were placed
                    over the graves of the British lords, and are now what is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Stonehenge.</hi> Alexander Mecham celebrates this fable in his
                    poem <hi rend="italic">He Divinoe Sapientiae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Laudibus.</hi> Polydore Virgil assigns another origin of Stonehenge: he tells
                    us that it was erected by the Britons as a monument to their general Ambrosius,
                    on the place where he fell in battle, to perpetuate the memory of his glorious
                    actions and services done to his country. Both these stories are rejected by our
                    best antiquaries, who, however, are by no means agreed as to the true origin of
                    this famous piece of antiquity.</p>
                <p>After the Britons had defeated the Saxons, and obliged them to retire northward,
                    Ambrosius is said to have convened.the princes and great men at York, where he
                    gave orders for repairing the churches destroyed by the Saxons, and restoring
                    the exercise of religion to its former lustre. This is confirmed by Matthew of
                    Westminster, who highly applauds the great zeal of Ambrosius in repairing the
                    churches, encouraging the clergy, and restoring the honour of religion. The
                    Monmouth historian gives this prince a very high character. He was a man,” says
                    he, “of such bravery and courage, that when he was in Gaul no one durst enter
                    the lists with him; for he was sure to unhorse his antagonist, or to break his
                    spear into shivers. He was, moreover, generous in bestowing, careful in
                    performing religious duties, moderate in all things, and more especially
                    abhorred a lie. He was strong on foot, stronger on horseback, and perfectly
                    qualified to command an army.” The same author tells us that he was poisoned at
                    Winchester, by one Eopa, a Saxon, disguised as a physician, and hired for that
                    purpose by Pascentius, one of the sons of Vortigern; but the generally received
                    opinion is, that he was killed in a battle which he lost in the year 508,
                    against Cerdic, one of the Saxon generals.</p>
