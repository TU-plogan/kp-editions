                <p><label type="entry">ALPHA</label>, the name of the first letter of the Greek
                    alphabet, answering to our A. As a numeral, it stands for one, or the first of
                    any thing. It is particularly used among ancient writers to denote the chief or
                    first man of his class or rank. In this sense the word stands
                    contradistinguished from <hi rend="italic">beta,</hi> which denotes the second
                    person. Plato was called the <hi rend="italic">Alpha</hi> of the wits.
                    Eratosthenes, keeper of the Alexandrian library, whom some called a <hi
                    rend="italic">Second Plato,</hi> is frequently named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beta.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Alpha</hi> is also used to denote the beginning
                    of any thing; in which* sense it stands opposed to <hi rend="italic">omega,</hi>
                    which denotes the end. And these two letters were made the symbol of
                    Christianity, and accordingly were engraven on the tombs of the ancient
                    Christians, to distinguish them from those of idolaters. Moralez, a Spanish
                    writer, imagined that this custom only commenced since the rise of Arianism, and
                    that it was peculiar to the orthodox, who hereby made confession of the eternity
                    of Christ; but there are tombs prior to the age of Constantine whereon the two
                    letters were found, besides that the emperor just mentioned bore them on his
                    labarum before Arius appeared.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">ALPHABET.</hi></p>
                <p>í</p>
                <p>TV*E have received the word <hi rend="italic">Alphabet</hi> immediately from '
                    the Latin, <hi rend="italic">alphabetum,</hi> for which substantive, however,
                    there is no better authority in that language than the writings of Tertullian
                    and St Jerome. The more classical Juvenal writes, “<hi rend="italic">Hoc</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">discunt omnes</hi><hi rend="italic">ante alpha</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">beta pueļlae,”</hi> which is literally,
                    “girls learn this before their A, B, C.” We do not find the word in Greek.
                    Athenaeus uses the adjective αraapαj¾ro; to signify a man who does not know the
                    first two letters; and it is from these two letters that our word <hi
                    rend="italic">alphabet</hi> is evidently derived·. Whatever the subsequent
                    arrangement may be, the letters A and B stand at the beginning of a great number
                    of alphabets. The ordinary definition of the word is a table or list of
                    characters, which are the signs of particular sounds. .Mathematicians have
                    amused themselves by calculating the number of combinations which roay be made
                    of these signs or sounds, r Tacquet, according to Harris, writes thus: “<hi
                    rend="italic">Mille</hi><hi rend="italic">milliones</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >scriptorum mille annorum millionibus non scribent omnes</hi> 24 <hi
                    rend="italic">litterarum alphabeti permutationes, licet singuli quotidie
                    absolverent</hi> 40 <hi rend="italic">'paginas, quarum unaquaeque contincret
                    diversos ordines</hi><hi rend="italic">li</hi><hi rend="italic">terarum</hi>
                    24.” We may doubt, perhaps, whether this pomp of numbers will give any very
                    clear notion even to a mathematician; but the passage shows, that for any
                    practical purpose the combinations of elementary sounds, and consequently the
                    number of words, may well be considered infinite. The consideration of the
                    peculiar sets of combinations which constitute, at least in part, what is called
                    the genius of a language, would be a curious inquiry, that has received but
                    little attention; but it does not belong to this head. It has been asserted that
                    the words of no two languages are respectively so unlike as the words in the
                    same language are to themselves, and to one another when read backwards; but
                    this consideration also, of whatever value it be, rather appertains to language
                    itself than to the elements of which it is composed.</p>
                <p>When we rèad the volumes of Lord Monboddo on the origin of language, we know not
                    whether to laugh more at his countless absurdities and boundless credulity, or
                    to wonder at his ingenuity and learning. Many other works have been composed On
                    the same subject, less ridiculous and less admirable, but equally unsuccessful
                    in clearing up the difficulties<pb break="no" facs="nls:193036829"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-6829-0540"/> which they sought to solve. The attempt which is
                    sometimes made to illustrate the invention of writing by that of language,
                    proves invariably to be an impotent effort to explain one unknown thing by
                    another. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The invention of alphabetic writing is
                    in truth an inexplicable mystery; we cannot touch it in any way, or approach it
                    on any side. As this opinion is contrary to the commonly received notions, we
                    will briefly state our reasons for adopting it.</p>
                <p>It is generally believed that certain steps may be observed, by means of which we
                    are able to trace the gradual progress of the invention. These are the songs and
                    rude drawings of savages, and some simple contrivances for preserving the memory
                    of numbers by beads and similar devices; but especially the Egyptian
                    hieroglyphics, the Chinese characters, and certain alphabets that are said to be
                    syllabic. Learned men have thought fit to assert that there once was a time when
                    no nation was able to write; but they are unable to bring any proof of this
                    assertion, and the evidence of history seems to contradict it. They tell us that
                    men composed songs and ballads to preserve the remembrance of past events, and
                    used paintings and knots to assist the memory. We know that some nations who are
                    unacquainted with letters use these artifices; and we can readily believe that
                    five beads on a string may represent five men, or five days, or five years, but
                    such a memorial has no connection with writing. We know, moreover, that in times
                    when writing is universal, ballads are made and sung, and paintings are
                    produced; and a person who is unwilling to forget an engagement sometimes ties a
                    knot on his pocket-handkerchief. Those who can write often avail themselves of
                    other aids; and those who cannot, have been obliged in all ages to do as well as
                    they can without. It is manifest that we shall not be able to find any firm
                    ground for placing the first step amongst the operations of savages. In common
                    with their civilized brethren, they have the desire to remember certain events;
                    but they have not done any thing to advance the peculiar means of which we
                    treat.</p>
                <p>The learned president Goguet, in his instructive and popular work, <hi
                    rend="italic">De l'</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Loix, des Arts,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Sciences,</hi> discourses at some length and with much ability of the invention
                    of writing. Having mentioned the substitutes which are adopted by savages, he
                    brings forward tlíe Egyptian hieroglyphics thus: “We have been a long time in
                    error as to the first use of hieroglyphics: men believed that the Egyptian
                    priests invented them for the purpose of hiding their knowledge from the vulgar,
                    but it is through want of attention that they have been thus deceived. We may
                    easily satisfy ourselves, that at the beginning they only employed hieroglyphics
                    to hand down and make known their laws, their usages, and their history. Nature
                    and necessity, not choice, have produced the different kinds of hieroglyphic
                    writing. It is an imperfect and defective invention, suitable to the ignorance
                    of the first ages: it was through want of the knowledge of letters that the
                    Egyptians had recourse to them. If this nation had found out alphabetic writing
                    before, they would have been too sensible of its advantages to employ any other.
                    The mistake concerning hieroglyphics has come from the Greeks. They were only
                    acquainted with the Egyptians in much later times. This people had then the use
                    of alphabetic characters. The ancient method of writing in hieroglyphics had
                    been neglected by the mass of the nation; but the Egyptian priests, who,
                    according to the custom of all the learned men of antiquity, were only concerned
                    about the means of hiding their learning, retained the hieroglyphic writing as a
                    fit veil to hide the knowledge of what they did not choose to divulge. It is
                    thus that, after the discovery of alphabetic writing, hieroglyphics became in
                    Egypt a secret and mysterious kind of writing.” It is plain that a sensible and
                    learned man here speaks too positively about matters which no one can know. If
                    the Greeks, who were acquainted with the Egyptians, although in later times, are
                    mistaken, how can we, who only know the Egyptians through their report, venture
                    to correct them? “But how did they arrive at this discovery ?” The president
                    afterwards candidly asks, “how did they pass from hieroglyphics, and even from
                    syllabic writing, to alphabetic characters ?” (It would not have been difficult
                    to have passed from syllabic writing if it had ever existed.) “This is not easy
                    to imagine. Hieroglyphics and syllabic writing certainly have no connection with
                    the letters of the alphabet.” (The latter undoubtedly has, for it represents
                    sounds.) “It was necessary, then, to change entirely the nature of the signs
                    which were used. In vain shall we have recourse to the writers of antiquity to
                    clear up this question. They do not show us in what manner these singular
                    transitions could have been made. We. may conjecture that the abridged marks of
                    hieroglyphic writing, of which I have spoken above, conducted to the still more
                    abridged method of alphabetic letters, which by their different combinations
                    express all the articulations of the voice in a simple and easy manner. This
                    conjecture becomes very probable. When we cast our eyes upon the alphabets of
                    some ancient nations, the letters which compose them appear, both by their forms
                    and their names, to have been taken from hieroglyphic signs. If we compare with
                    attention what remains of the Egyptians with the hieroglyphic figures engraved
                    on the obelisks and other monuments, we shall perceive that the Egyptian letters
                    derive their origin from the hieroglyphics.” “The Ethiopic alphabet, and the
                    majuscule letters of the Armenians, also supply proofs of what I advance: we
                    find there very distinct traces of the ancient hieroglyphic character.” We know
                    not what he means by “the ancient Egyptian characters,” unless it be the Coptic
                    alphabet, which is posterior to and derived from the Greek, as Plate XXI.
                    demonstrates. It shows also the Ethiopic letters, and the ordinary Armenian,
                    which are not ancient: still less are the majuscules or capitals: the latter are
                    undoubtedly formed in the shape of animals, &amp;c.; but they are like the
                    illuminated letters that were used as initials in the middle ages. These
                    certainly were not taken from hieroglyphics, but were designed for ornament; and
                    so is it likewise with the majuscules of the Armenians, which were a very late
                    invention; and it is matter of history, and not of conjecture, that they were
                    taught them by the Greeks. It is very doubtful whether the paintings of the
                    Mexicans, of which some writers have treated largely, had any connection with
                    writing, or were intended for any thing but pictures; in truth nothing is known
                    about them, and we may at once dismiss them äs having no relation to the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>The hieroglyphics appear to be related to the alphabet; and as they are very
                    extraordinary in themselves, and have received much attention from the learned,
                    we must speak somewhat fully of them; although they will not enable us to trace
                    any transition or progress towards alphabetic writing, which is perfect and
                    complete wherever it exists, the instances usually adduced of imperfect and
                    incipient writing being in our opinion entirely unfounded; and it is an
                    unwarranted assumption, that the Egyptian hieroglyphics preceded the use of the
                    letters or the alphabet, of which there is no proof, whatever testi<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193036842" xml:id="kp-eb0702-6842-0541"/>mony exists being
                    to the contrary. In every generation there have been a few gifted interpreters,
                    who have professed that they were able to read the hieroglyphics; nor have these
                    been wanting in our own times. The expedition of the French to Egypt, and
                    especially the discovery of the famous Rosetta stone, which, the late Dr Young
                    declares, was an ample compensation for all that the two armies suffered, gave a
                    powerful impulse to these studies. It had been observed on the Egyptian
                    monuments, that clusters of figures were often included in a ring, scroll, or
                    cartouch; and it was deemed expedient that these should represent proper names.
                    To meet the exigency of the case the <hi rend="italic">Phonetic</hi> system was
                    devised, which is briefly this: if we suppose that the scroll contains a dog, an
                    ass, and a yew-tree, the initials of the three words are taken, and they form
                    the word Day; and this by the hypothesis is a proper name; and we may infer, if
                    we please, that Potiphar had read Sandford and Merton, and was greatly delighted
                    with that excellent work. The language, however, in which the objects that
                    supply the initials are to be named, is not English, but Coptic; but the
                    results, we shall see, are precisely the same. Let us assume that the figure of
                    a bird denotes A; since the engraving is not executed with the exquisite
                    accuracy of a Bewick, it may be an albatross, a buzzard, a crow, a duck, an
                    eagle—any bird, in short, in the Coptic vocabulary, and any letter in the
                    alphabet; and so with the tree, which stands for B: it may be an apple, a beech,
                    a cedar, or any arborescent vegetable whatever: and, as if this were not loose
                    enough, each letter has several visible objects, each of which may be made to
                    run the gauntlet of the alphabet. The number of figures contained in the scroll,
                    we should have imagined, would control the length of the word, and indicate the
                    number of the letters; but they are relieved from that slight responsibility
                    thus: since every allowance ought to be made for a scribe who writes upon
                    granite, IITOΛM. will stand for ∏τ∙oλiμα∕oς; or, if there be a redundancy of
                    objects, the superfluous letters are disposed of as symbolical, and are classed
                    with the goose and globe, or the goose and gridiron, and some other favourite
                    emblems. Although there be figures enough to complete the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >ιlτaKiμaιος,</hi> that monarch, if it be not 'his turn, may be desired to stand
                    aside: any three may be chosen to spell Day, and the other seven may be
                    explained symbolically to signify the author of Sandford and Merton, or any
                    thing any body pleases. Such is the Phonetic system, and its-results are such
                    also as might have been expected. Dr Young, an ingenious and learned person,
                    founding himself on certain notions entertained by Warburton, proceeded with
                    singular zeal· and activity to compass and imagine discoveries which we are not
                    able to relate. We will only observe briefly, that any conjecture of that
                    prelate may safely be presumed to be wrong; for although his energy, learning,
                    and acuteness, were undoubtedly great, experience has shown, that from haste or
                    some other cause his views are commonly erroneous. Dr Young, being in that vein,
                    of course went on from discovery to discovery, being guided by that warm fancy
                    which usually attends real talent; and, as is ever the case on such occasions,
                    every person who took the pains to investigate the matter found Precisely what
                    he was looking for and most desired: no one was ever disappointed. MM.
                    Champollion-Figéac, Sylvestre de Sacy, D’Akerblad, and many other foreigners,
                    learned to read,—to run and read. The hieroglyphics were as legible when they
                    rode by the obelisks as the names over our shops. Our own. countrymen ran a
                    bnght career of glory. Mr W. J. Bankes, Mr Salt, and others saw immediately
                    strong confirmations. Even Mr George Grey, a very estimable young gentleman, who
                    took a little trip to Egypt in the season, according to the fashion, crept into
                    the great pyramid and out again, saw every thing, bought a charming pair of
                    mummies, a cock and a hen, cut them open, and found, without knowing it, the
                    “ring of Polycrates,” as Dr Young says, and perhaps also that of Hans Carvel. He
                    found a Greek translation, it is said, of a manuscript, which had recently been
                    brought from Egypt to Paris. The original was in the Enchorial character, and
                    the translation showed that it was a sale of land. It was, moreover, duly
                    registered and probably stamped; but that we are not told. That a landowner
                    should go to bed with his title-deeds in his stomach, that the muniments of the
                    deceased should be buried with him, ought to astonish us, even in an age of
                    discovery. It shows, however, the perfection of the enchorial registration in
                    Egypt, that the settlement was buried with the first tenant for life who died;
                    and it will be a wholesome example to our lawcommissioners, who are about to
                    introduce registration in England, and an admonition to make the public title so
                    complete, that all private securities may safely be dispensed with. The papyrus
                    which Mr George Grey brought from Egypt refers, however, not to the
                    hieroglyphics, but to the characters called enchorial, which are the second in
                    order of the three inscriptions on the Rosetta stone. They seem to be
                    alphabetic, although no one has been able hitherto to make out the alphabet. It
                    is hard indeed to imagine, that there ever was any writing which was not
                    alphabetic. Efforts have been made to interpret these also, but after turning
                    over a few pages of the interpretation, the reader is disposed to say to the
                    interpreter, “if you are permitted to read an inscription either backwards or
                    forwards, to consider the letters as imperfectly formed, to select them from any
                    alphabet that will suit your purpose, to turn them round or invert them, to
                    supply, and amend, and reject at pleasure, to take any form of any word in any
                    language you choose, and to make great allowances for barbarism, ignorance,
                    foreign spelling, and so forth,—if you may do all these things, and cannot find
                    your own name, your mother’s, and mine, in any writing whatever, you certainly
                    are not fit to decipher enchorial characters.” The hieroglyphicswhich the
                    accomplished Dr Young and his admiring disciples, whether foreign or domestic,
                    were unable to read or to reconcile with their hypotheses, they boldly declared,
                    after the usage of interpreters, to be spurious, and said that they had been
                    negligently and unskilfully sculptured at Rome, in imitation of the Egyptian
                    manner. They speak with as much confidence about a good and a bad style in
                    hieroglyphic inscriptions, as if they were critics writing in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Egyptian Review,</hi> if we can fancy that such a periodical
                    existed under the Pharaohs or Ptolemies, arid deciding, in a summary manner and
                    without appeal, on the literary merits of the new obelisks and pyramids as they
                    appeared. So intolerant were they of the claims of what Dr Young in his first
                    zeal termed “an exorbitant antiquity,” that they condemned as forgeries some of
                    the finest and most admired of the Egyptian monuments. But such aggressions upon
                    the reverential feelings of mankind being likely to provoke retaliation, and to
                    endanger the theory, they devised an ingenious expedient, and found, under the
                    more modern scrolls, containing the names of Ptolemies or Roman emperors, the
                    vestiges of more ancient scrolls comprehending those of older and native princes
                    which had been erased to make way for the usurpers. Some of these, it is said,
                    have been deciphered. And since it has been the fashion to discover the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193036855" xml:id="kp-eb0702-6855-0542"/>ňames of the
                    ancient kings of Egypt? many buildings have been restored to their original
                    rank, and almost every scroll decided to stand in the place of one that had been
                    obliterated. We would recommend some of the most sharp-sighted of these
                    antiquaries to look well if there be not a third and older name under the
                    second, that even “exorbitant antiquity” may once more be taken into favour. Mr
                    Salt, in his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Phonetic System of
                    Hieroglyphics,</hi> shows, that even in the symbolical department, which of
                    course must be the most lax, it is necessary to humour the theory a good deal.
                    This zealous convert speaks thus of Horapollo: “Having so often quoted this
                    author, I may here state, that though I am convinced, for numerous reasons, that
                    the first book and part of the second are written by a person perfectly
                    acquainted with Egyptian hieroglyphics, yet so am I perfectly persuaded that the
                    remainder is a vile interpolation, excepting perhaps the three or four last
                    hieroglyphics, which seem to have been reserved from the original wórk, and
                    placed at the end, more effectually to deceive the reader.” This is very like
                    choosing so much of a writer as will serve a favourite purpose, and rejecting
                    the rest. It is unnecessary, however, to pursue this part of the subject
                    farther. If we admit that the discovery of the phonetic system was very
                    admirable; that it is demonstrated clearly, it may be mathematically; that the
                    examples have been adduced with perfect candour and fairness; that it will
                    afford much valuable illustration to the history of Egypt; and that it is
                    madness, or even a crime, to doubt its truth and importance: if we concede all
                    this, and more, it will not assist us in discovering the origin of the alphabet.
                    The phonetic system· is essentially alphabetic; the bird, and the tree, and the
                    other figures within the scroll, are not hieroglyphics, but letters: they
                    represent sounds. It is not a transition from hieroglyphics to letters: it is
                    not a step in advance; but, if it be a step, it is assuredly a step backwards;
                    for it is merely the substitution of clumsy and ambiguous letters for others
                    that were simple and certain. The dog, the ass, and the yew-tree do not
                    represent the author of Sandford and Merton symbolically or hieroglyphically.
                    That ingenious person had not any of the properties peculiar to these objects.
                    The three figures are an awkward manner of writing the three letters that
                    compose his name, and any other object might be agreed upon to denote the same
                    letters without reference to the initials, which could only have been chosen to
                    assist the memory. A man, a woman, and a child would of course spell Day, if it
                    were understood that a man was in the place of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the
                    other figures of the other letters. Thus every one might compose at pleasure
                    innumerable phonetic systems.</p>
                <p>There is no foundation for the assertion of the president Goguet, and of other
                    learned men, that the Egyptian hiéroglyphics preceded the invention of
                    alphabetic writing: Whatever testimony exists is to the contrary. It is vain to
                    argue that it is improbable any persons would use such cumbrous and inconvenient
                    writing after they had experienced the advantages of a simple and convenient
                    method; for there is abundant evidence, as the learned president admits, that it
                    was practised long after they had become acquainted with the excellent alphabet
                    of the Greeks. It is not easy to understand and to reconcile the passages in
                    which the various Sorts of writing that prevailed in Egypt are mentioned; the.
                    enchorial, the hieratic, the sacred, the demotic, the Ethiopic, &amp;c. Our
                    limits will not permit us to comment upon, or even to extract, the statements of
                    Herodotus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Porphyry, Heliodorus, and others. The first
                    author tells us that, unlike the Greeks, they wrote from the right to the left;
                    and Clement and Porphyry affirm that the hieroglyphics were the invention of the
                    priests, for the purpose of mystery and religious secrecy. Our physicians write
                    their prescriptions in an uncouth character, and with barbarous abbreviations,
                    not because they are unacquainted with the ordinary writing, but through
                    quackery and for concealment; and for the same reasons the record in a court of
                    law is made up in the form of a carpet, or the sail of a ship; and many similar
                    devices, not unworthy of Tartars or Laplanders, are practised there, and in the
                    composition of deeds, not through ignorance, but of design. If the hieroglyphics
                    be in truth writing, and history seems to declare that they are, it is most
                    probable that they are alphabetic; not only because we are told that they were
                    invented when letters were in use, but because it is impossible to conceive any
                    writing which is not such. Whether we shall ever obtain the alphabet, is very
                    doubtful. It is easy to imagine many systems, but it is perhaps impossible to
                    fix upon any. An animal or other object might represent a letter; and the
                    representations might be varied according to fixed rules; or the parts of an
                    animal might be the letters, and the animal itself would then be a word. There
                    is no end of conjectures. It is not impossible, although the supposition has
                    never been hazarded, that the priests wrote in initials only, like the Roman
                    lawyers, who, partly for the sake of brevity, and partly and principally for
                    concealment, entered their forms in that manner. A Roman notary would begin a
                    will thus: T. I. T. L. W. A. T. &amp;c. “This is the last will and testament,”
                    &amp;c. Apuleius supplies a curious passage, which seems to imply that the
                    sacred books were partly secured against profane readers by abbreviations. “Et
                    injecta dextera senex comissimus ducit me protinus ad ipsas fores aedis
                    amplissimae; rituque solemni apertionis celebrato ministerio, ac matutino
                    peracto sacrificio, de opertis adyti profert quosdam libros, literis
                    ignorabilibus praenotatos: partim figuris cujusce-modi animalium, concepti
                    sermonis compendiosa verba suggerentes; partim nodosis et in modum rotae
                    tortuosis, ca-preolatimque condensis apicibus, a curiosa profanorum lectione
                    munita.” <hi rend="italic">{Metamorph,</hi> lib. 11.) We know not whence the
                    Roman lawyers derived this kind of cipher or abbreviation, of which they made
                    much use. It was a favourite practice likewise of the Rabbins to compose
                    memorial words of initials. We are told that the hieroglyphics were the
                    invention of the priests, and were connected with religion: it is probable
                    therefore that they contain rituals, perhaps in an abbreviated form. The
                    frequent repetitions of the same characters, and the perpetual recurrence of the
                    same sets of characters, favour this supposition. The frequent repetitions of
                    the services of the church of Rome furnished cause of complaint at the
                    Reformation. In the liturgies of the Greek church they are far more remarkable.
                    If we open any book of Greek offices, we shall find such directions as, “here
                    make 60 kyries, then 30 doxas, then 30 <hi rend="italic">χαfξtς,</hi> and then
                    60 more kyries.” The tedious ceremonies are infinitely protracted by such
                    wholesale orders. The ancient Egyptians surpassed all people, even the Hindoos,
                    in their addiction to religious exercises. We may read copious details of the
                    prodigious exertions of the early Egyptian monks, who brought, with the common
                    zeal of converts, the peculiar sentiments and habits of their nation, amongst
                    whom all was prayer and rite, every thing was sacred, the whole land swarmed
                    with gods, u we could translate, a hieroglyphic inscription, we should probably
                    find that it comprehended the rites to be ed in consecrating∙∙a punt. It would
                    direct the faithful <pb break="no" facs="nls:193036868"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-6868-0543"/>waterman to find the day and hour for the ceremony
                    by certain rule's, and to prepare himself and his boat for so many days in such
                    a manner. At the. proper hour, having made all pŗevious preparations, he would
                    be enjoined to turn his face to the north, and to say such and such and such
                    prayers so many times, making certain gesticulations; and then to turn to the
                    south, and to say the same, and this, that, and another, ten times as often,
                    with the same gestures and some others. It Is easy to imagine that the shortest
                    epitome of the formula, although the boat was not to be used for fishing, or in
                    a part of the Nile where crocodiles abounded, would Cover the walls of a
                    building, as large as Westminster Hall; for if such folly be once permitted to
                    begin, it is perfectly impossible to assign a reason why it should ever
                    terminate. If such be the treasures which are locked up in the sacred
                    characters, as it is most, likely they are, we need not repine if we, are never
                    permitted to find the key; for it is plain that an authentic and faithful report
                    of the precise words which have been uttered in all the masses that have been
                    said for the repose of the souls of the departed, would be neither an amusing
                    nor an instructive, although a very voluminous, pile of writing.</p>
                <p>We have shown, we trust, that no assistance can be derived from the hieroglyphics
                    towards discovering the origin of the alphabet. We will next examine, more
                    briefly it is true than we would, the nature of the Chinese characters, which it
                    is, pretended afford much light, and indeed are an infallible, guide to the
                    invention of the alphabet. Let us suppose that, the tradition as to the sound of
                    the Greek letters, and all that has been written on the subject, were lost, but
                    that we retained all the other, materials for learning Greek which we still
                    possess: if it were deemed expedient to study that divide language, wė might
                    still acquire it with pain and difficulty, as we learn the Chinese; and
                    considering the word αλλfi; as a symbol, we should call it <hi rend="italic"
                    >another</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">ποKυς, βwς,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">βιος,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ποταμοί,</hi> would be regarded
                    as pictures, and remembered as such; and, without reference to their original
                    sound, would be named <hi rend="italic">many,</hi> an <hi rend="italic">ox,
                    life,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">river.</hi> In copying these and other words,
                    not as sounds composed of simple elements, but as drawings of objects, they
                    would doubtless be much disfigured in the course of ages; it would even be
                    desirable to vary their forms designedly, and to make them as grotesque and
                    striking as possible, to assist the memory, which would surely deserve the aid
                    of the compassionate. They would, moreover,, be divided into classes, according
                    to some clumsy calculation of the number of. strokes by which they are formed,
                    like the Chinese characters, that they might be arranged in dictionaries. Some
                    mythic story of the invention of the Greek symbols would be current in Europe,
                    as similar fables are received in China. The ingenious persons who occupy
                    themselves in finding reasons to account? for every thing just as it exists, or
                    is supposed to exist, and lavish their admiration upon it, would indulge in
                    raptures at contemplating the living, moving pictures which these symbols
                    present. Not Cuyp himself, they would declare, could paint such a spirited ox as
                    is sketched out by the image <hi rend="italic">βους</hi>; and if the sign <hi
                    rend="italic">ποταμοί</hi> were drawn large and black, go that the memory might
                    seize on it through the θye and-hold it fast, it would be refreshing, they would
                    swear, on a sultry day to sit beside it and gaze on it; for no stream would be
                    so lovely as that gentle Greek river,</p>
                <l part="N"> Qui fluit illimis, nitidis argenteus undis. </l>
                <p>It is no light matter to learn Greek now; what would it be under the
                    circumstances we have Supposed! When mankind were at last quite weary of
                    admiring the Greek symbols, and of weeping over myriads .of schoolboys who had
                    been fairly flogged to death, some great man would at last arise, who,
                    considering that all written language must of necessity be alphabetic, although,
                    the alphabet may have been lost in some cases amidst national convulsions, would
                    proceed patiently to analyze the characters, not as a logician to seek for
                    genera and species, nor as an artist to look for exquisite touches of art, but
                    simply as a grammarian, to make out the letters. He would carefully dissect a
                    character into parts, and assign arbitrarily to each part its sound,’ taking due
                    care to make those parts or letters vowels which occur in words in such a manner
                    as to render it necessary or convenient so to consider them for the purpose of
                    articulation. He might, for example, call αλλof <hi rend="italic">uttak,</hi>
                    and τroau; <hi rend="italic">gatek</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> the harmony of
                    the language would be deteriorated or improved by the change, according to the
                    taste of the age. But when the supposed symbols were once more restored to an
                    alphabetic form, although entirely different sounds might have been substituted
                    for the ancient, it would not be more difficult to acquire the language, than if
                    the original alphabet had never been lost. “The Chinese characters, taken in
                    general, are, as every body knows, images and symbols, designed to represent
                    directly material objects, by an imitation more or less exact, and other objects
                    by metaphors. more or less ingenious. .They are consequently entirely
                    unconnected with pronunciation, and do not Stand for any sounds, As it is
                    necessary, however, that books should be read aloud, they attach by convention
                    to each character A simple -or complex syllable, which brings to the mind, in
                    the spoken language, the same idea as the character in writing; but nothing in
                    the latter denotes the sound or the syllable, and it is very possible to
                    understand the one without knowing the other, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa”</hi> We quote these words from the excellent work of Μ. Abel Remusat,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Langues Tortares.</hi> Μ. Freŗet, who tells the strange tale in
                    his sensible reflections on the Chinese writing, in the sixth volume of the <hi

                    and we may add, that when we believe that the whole population of China are
                    dumb, then will it seem worthy of belief, which is utterly incredible, that any
                    kind of writing was ever devised that was not alphabetic. A person who gives
                    from a Greek book, without naming the words in the oriġînąl tongue, a literal
                    translation in English, is like the man who reads aloud Chinese writing in the
                    spoken language of China.* He renders one language by another, and of two
                    languages it is possible to know the one and not the other. Some understand
                    English who are ignorant of Greek, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> “It
                    was necessary sometimes,” Μ. Abel Re-musat continues, “for the Chinese to
                    represent in writing the proper names of persons and of places, and of new
                    oþjects and ideas. When their knowledge extended, they found that it was
                    impossible to invent figures sufficiently exact, or to compose symbols
                    sufficiently characteristic, to dénote, in such a manner that they should be
                    recognised, different natural objects,—quadrupeds, birds, fishes, trees, &amp;c.
                    Many expedients occurred, and were successively em-píoyed. They might take a
                    symbol which was already known, and make it the sign of an individual. All
                    proper names in China are characters of this sort. Most commonly there is
                    nothing in these characters to mark this kind of alteration. Sometimes, however,
                    they add to the symbol which has been thus stripped of its original meaning, the
                    sign of the mouth, to show the change it has <pb break="no" facs="nls:193036881"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-6881-0544"/>undergone.” The sign of the mouth is precisely
                    equivalent to the use of the capital letter, which with us marks a proper name,
                    and shows that Mead signifies, not a liquor, but a physician, and Rose a man,
                    and not a flower. .Why one man should ever have been called Mead and another
                    Rose, is as much a mystery as any thing in Chinese literature, although the
                    question has not yet provoked an elaborate disquisition concerning the first
                    Mead or the origin of Roses. “The second method is of so much consequence in
                    Chinese writing, that from the most ancient times it has been accounted one of
                    the six rules for forming characters. It consists in taking, as in the former
                    case, a simple or complex symbol, and adding another, which denotes that it
                    signifies a tree, a bird, &amp;c. Almost all the names of natural objects are
                    thus represented by two characters, one of which represents the genus, and the
                    other the species.” There is nothing peculiar in this method—it is common to all
                    languages. We make compound words by the union of two simple, as tea-pot,
                    coffee-pot; the latter word denoting the genus pot, and the former, or rather
                    the two together, the species. These and similar contrivances, therefore, do not
                    prove that there was a transition or gradual passage from symbolic to alphabetic
                    writing. It is urged that tradesmen and ignorant persons in China frequently use
                    those signs indifferently which have the same names but a different
                    signification, for all the several purposes of the various characters; but this
                    is not a step. <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> In like manner, a boy has been
                    known, in endeavouring to translate “thou shalt till” into Latin, to have found
                    in his dictionary “till, <hi rend="italic">donce”</hi> and to have written down
                    “<hi rend="italic">donecabis”</hi> If a foreigner arrives in China, and it is
                    necessary to give him a name in writing, they usually assign to him some new
                    combination of characters, which has no reference to the sound of his name. It
                    is asserted, however,,that they sometimes seek to express by their characters
                    the sound of his name. If it be Har-ri-son, for instance, they take the three
                    characters the names of which most resemble in sound the three syllables of the
                    proper name. This would certainly be syllabic writing; but there is no
                    satisfactory proof that it was ever devised by the Chinese themselves. It would
                    occur very naturally to a foreigner who was familiar with alphabetic writing,
                    and knew something of the language of the country. The spoken language of China
                    consists entirely of monosyllables; consequently the necessity for such an
                    expedient could never arise, except in conjunction with foreigners who are used
                    to the alphabet. They could have no idea of a syllable, as distinct from and
                    forming part of a word; and the name Harrison would not be to their ears one
                    word of three syllables, but three separate words, each a monosyllable. We do
                    not wonder if the Chinese have picked up from strangers a little instruction in
                    reading; we are rather astonished that, in consequence of their addiction to old
                    customs, they have not learned more. It has been said that the Japanese have
                    adopted an alphabet of syllables of this kind, consisting of as many of the
                    Chinese characters as are necessary to furnish it. We must withhold our assent
                    to the existence of syllabic alphabets, until we have actually examined one that
                    is not manifestly composed of letters. We read also that some nations of Tartars
                    use an alphabet constructed of Chinese characters, either entire or mutilated.
                    If we were to select 26 of these characters, we might or course write our own
                    language in the same cipher; and the only consequence would be, that ŵe should
                    adopt very incommodious letters. Musical sounds, numbers, the signs of the
                    Zodiac, and a few other matters of peculiar simplicity, are marked by arbitrary
                    symbols, which have no reference to sound, and are understood by many nations.
                    These examples, however, do not prove that it is possible to contrive a
                    universal character, or to invent such a language, as the written Chinese is
                    alleged to be. It would no doubt be a work of considerable difficulty, but. not
                    insuperable, to analyze the Chinese characters, and to reduce them to an
                    alphabetic, form. It would probably be necessary to assign several figures to
                    the same letter—but this is common in other languages—and other expedients might
                    be needed ∙ but the result would facilitate immensely the acquisition of a
                    language rich in a prodigious number of finely printed books. Hyde and others
                    maintained that the language of the Manchou Tartars, in which there exist
                    translations of most of the Chinese books, was, like the written language of
                    China, symbolic; yet by the labours of MM. Amyot and Langles it has been
                    dissected into very comfortable and legible alphabetic letters. The spoken
                    language of China <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> is a vulgar, barbarous, and most
                    imperfect jargon, that has never been reduced into writing, and has essentially
                    no more connection with the written language than the Welsh or the Basque. If we
                    must concede, contrary, to reason and probability, that the Chinese characters
                    contain a symbolic writing which is not alphabetic, they do not afford any
                    assistance towards tracing the invention of the alphabet; for there is no proof
                    that the Chinese, by their own means, and without foreign aid, have advanced a
                    single step.</p>
                <p>The uses of the alphabet are sweet and marvellous, and its origin, like the
                    signification of the Egyptian hieroglyphics, undiscovered; but its structure is
                    usually imperfect. It is commonly at once deficient and redundant, and the
                    arrangement immethodical. In our own language, for example, although we have the
                    sounds of the long and short vowels, we have . only one character for each
                    vowel; and it is left doubtful which sound is intended, or it is pointed out by
                    the addition of other letters. In ben the <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is short; in
                    bean, been, bene, it is long, and the syllable might be spelled thus, bēn. The
                    Greeks have a distinct character for the long and the short <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> and two for <hi rend="italic">o</hi> likewise; but their alphabet is as
                    deficient as our own with respect to the other three vowels. If the Romans had
                    used ten signs for vowels instead of five, all that difficult department of
                    grammar which teaches the quantity of syllables would have been superseded by a
                    simple and mechanical contrivance. Our alphabet is said to be redundant, because
                    the one sound of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is expressed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >k,</hi> and the other by s. It is true that <hi rend="italic">eh</hi> is a
                    peculiar sound, differing from that of <hi rend="italic">sh,</hi> as cherry
                    differs from sherry: it is true, however, that it might be represented by <hi
                    rend="italic">kh,</hi> if our orthographers had thought fit to ordain it. <hi
                    rend="italic">F</hi> is said to be redundant, because we might spell fig, phig:
                    for we write philosopher, whilst the Italians use <hi rend="italic"
                    >filosofo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and so with some other letters. As the
                    Greek is pronounced in England, the χ is superfluous for the purposes of speech,
                    and its place might always be supplied by <hi rend="italic">X.</hi> It
                    distinguishes nevertheless many words to the eye, and is useful in etymology,
                    on" account of which, letters that would be redundant if they were to be tried
                    by the verdict of the ear alone, have been retained in many alphabets. If the
                    number of our own letters be too small, the deficiency is not very great. Those
                    who affirm that there is the largest amount of simple sounds in our language,
                    would not extend it beyond 32 or 33 characters, and their opponents would cut it
                    down to about half the number: 26, therefore, is a tolerably fair mean between
                    these extremes.</p>
                <p>The lovers of method complain grievously that the arrangement of the letters is
                    most unphilosophical. There <pb break="no" facs="nls:193036894"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-6894-0545"/>is no reason, they truly affirm, why <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> should succeed to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> or</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> to <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in the
                    Latin and English, or <hi rend="italic">g</hi> in the Greek and Hebrew
                    alphabets. The vowels, they maintain, ought to walk first, and to be marshalled
                    precisely according to the aperture that each demands from the mouth to give it
                    due utterance; and the consonants ought to be arranged with reference to the
                    organ to which they arc chiefly indebted,—the lips, the teeth, the tongue, the
                    throat. If we were about to compose an alphabet for the first time, such
                    precision might be permitted; but this change, like most others, would be
                    attended with many inconveniences. The next generation, for example, could not
                    use our dictionaries and encyclopaedias; and as the letters are sorted on the
                    next page of the primer, although not in the alphabet itself, the advantage
                    would be very trifling. An extreme and rigid regularity does not suit mankind;
                    men love anomalies, exceptions, and varieties. In some languages, as in the
                    Italian, and. very probably, if we can judge of the pronunciation of the ancient
                    Romans, in the Latin, each letter performs its office with great constancy and
                    uniformity, and indicates the sound according to a few simple and well-observed
                    rules; in others, as in some of the Celtic tongues, the only use of letters
                    seems to be to mislead, and to show what is not the true pronunciation. The
                    English orthography torments foreigners, and presents difficulties that appear
                    at first to be insuperable: by perseverance, however, they find the clue to the
                    labyrinth, and acknowledge that the maze is not always without a plan. The mode
                    of spelling that was observed in the middle ages, especially in English and
                    French, was to admit into words every letter that could possibly claim a shadow
                    of right to be there. It resembles the style of law proceedings, the grand canon
                    of composition and construction therein being, so that all is there that ought
                    to be, it matters little how much is there that ought not: the excess may help,
                    but cannot hurt, and may be rejected as surplusage. The French, after their
                    peculiar manner, by means of the Roman letters, have cooked up strange kickshaws
                    of words; their pronunciation, however, whimsical as it is,' being practically,
                    and especially amongst those who speak soberly and moderately, less absurd than
                    the extraordinary persons who compose grammars of that language would have us
                    believe.</p>
                <p>• The forms of letters in different systems are of course very various. It is
                    curious to contrast the complicated characters of the Gothic, or of German text,
                    or of some languages that are less generally known, with more simple alphabets,
                    especially with those used in modern systems of short-hand. These extremely
                    simple letters, however, are not so favourable to rapidity in reading as in
                    writing: plainness and distinctness, a certain form that fills the eye, giving
                    to each its proper individuality, are essential to give facility to the reader’s
                    office. If there were no other books but manuscripts, it would certainly be of
                    great importance that such characters only should be used as the transcriber
                    could execute with the utmost celerity: but as copies are now multiplied by
                    printing, it matters little whether the letters are simple or complex; for
                    although it may be more difficult to jnakc the punches, and more troublesome to
                    cast the types, these considerations cannot greatly influence the price of
                    books, l∏e manner of arranging letters and words is also va-nous. The Chinese,
                    and a few other people, dispose the jvords in perpendicular lines, one word
                    below another; but most nations conform to the general practice of placing them
                    in horizontal rows: and the world is nearly equally divided on the question,
                    whether it be expedient tb begin to write at the right or the left side of· the
                    page.</p>
                <p>The people of the East usually adopt the former, and those of the West the latter
                    method. There are some exceptions, however: the Sanscrit is written, like the
                    English, from the left to the right; and the Etruscans seem to have committed a
                    similar error in longitude, for they proceeded, like the Arabs, from the right
                    towards the left. The one arrangement is quite as convenient as the other.
                    Persons who are prejudiced in favour of every thing to which they have been
                    accustomed, have imagined reasons in support of the superiority of our method:
                    daily practice convinces us that it is very excellent; but we must acknowledge,
                    notwithstanding, that the best writers are to be found amongst the people who
                    write from the right hand to the left. The Chinese, it is said, in their
                    peculiar way, attain to great skill and excellence.</p>
                <p>There is one kind of arrangement that was anciently in use among the Greeks,
                    which is very remarkable: the letters proceed from the left to the right, and
                    back again from the right to the left, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi>
                    alternately, like the course of an ox in ploughing, whence it has received the
                    name ∕3ouo ’ rgop&gt;]δov. We can imagine that a person writing running-hand
                    very rapidly might be tempted to adopt this alternate path for the sake of
                    dispatch—although such perhaps would not be the result—in order to save the time
                    that is wasted in carrying the hand back from the end of one line to the
                    beginning of the next; but this could not be the motive that suggested its use
                    in the inscriptions that are now in existence. It was probably esteemed sacred
                    from its connection with ploughing, which was always a holy thing. A treaty
                    written thus was more likely therefore to be observed. If a bill of exchange had
                    a better chance of being accepted or paid were it sped like the plough, the
                    sacred arrangement would no doubt be adopted by the drawers of these
                    instruments.</p>
                <p>The inconveniences of a diversity of characters have induced some speculative
                    persons to endeavour to devise a universal character, and even to remedy the
                    curse of Babel by a universal language. The great Leibnitz employed himself
                    much, it is said, on these speculations, but without success. John Wilkins,
                    bishop of Chester, a less able man, composed <hi rend="italic">An Essay towards
                    a Peal Character and an Universal Language,</hi> which was printed by the Royal
                    Society in 1668. Whoever will open this thick folio, will not be surprised that
                    the husband of Oliver Cromwell’s sister had but few disciples, or, whatever
                    learning and ingenuity the book may display, that it has long been forgotten. It
                    has rarely happened that men of distinguished ability have sought to introduce a
                    severe uniformity into any science. Speculators who propose to furnish
                    characters that will faithfully represent all the sounds of all the letters of
                    all languages, only show that they have not accurate ears: sounds are infinite,
                    and cannot be thus portrayed. Men have vainly discoursed also concerning a
                    natural language: there is no language natural to man. It is not natural to call
                    a horse a horse,_ or by any other name; but it is perfectly natural, for it is
                    the universal practice, to call that animal by some name or other which is
                    understood by those with whom we communicate. If there were a universal
                    character to represent words, and it were generally received, so that the
                    character for a horse should be read by an Englishman <hi rend="italic"
                    >horse,</hi> by a Frenchman <hi rend="italic">cheval,</hi> by a Spaniard <hi
                    rend="italic">caballx),</hi> and by a German <hi rend="italic">pferd,</hi> as
                    has been recommended, it would avail little. The syntax and construction of
                    languages are so various, that although the characters might be understood, and
                    every word intelligible by itself, the sense of a whole passage that had been
                    written by a German would be utterly unintelligible to a Frenchman.</p>

                <p>The Chinese is said to be a language of which the structure is remarkably easy
                    and simple. As a proof that it is not enough to know the meaning of the words,
                    but that it is necessary to be familiar with the collocation, in order to
                    comprehend the sense of the author, let us take an example at hazard from the
                    grammar of M. Abel Remusat. The following is a literal translation: “<hi
                    rend="italic">Sicut amat sicut scit agit eam amat</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cam</hi><hi rend="italic">eam qui</hi><hi rend="italic">cam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">qui qui non qui noni</hi> Could Bishop Wilkins himself detect the
                    meaning which lurks in these few and very plain words? They are rendered thus,
                    having been re-arranged according to the rules of a system which is far more
                    artificial, but with which, through habit, we are conversant: <hi rend="italic"
                    >“Celui qui</hi><hi rend="italic">la connoit</hi><hi rend="italic">(la vertu) ne
                    vaut pas celui qui</hi><hi rend="italic">l’aime</hi><hi rend="italic">; celui
                    qui l’aime ne vaut pas celui qui la pratique"</hi> If we are unable to interpret
                    a short and easy sentence in an inartificial language, with the forms of which
                    we are unacquainted, is it not certain, that if one of the long and rhetorical
                    periods of Demosthenes, to say nothing of more obscure writers, were transcribed
                    in the universal character, it would be as incomprehensible as a Babylonian
                    brick covered with arrow-headed characters, to a person familiar with the
                    universal writing, but who had not mastered the majestic but abstruse idiom of
                    the Greek tongue? Nor is there a natural collocation of words. All collocation
                    is artificial; and that to which the reader is most accustomed seems to him to
                    be the most natural. He who speaks of the natural order of a sentence, and
                    recommends that it should be observed in his projects for grammatical
                    uniformity, commits the same error as the sailor who condemned the Spaniards
                    with many oaths, as a most unnatural race, for calling a hat <hi rend="italic"
                    >sombrero,</hi> and not, like men, by its natural name, a hat.</p>
                <p>Having spoken as largely as our limits will permit of the alphabet in general, we
                    will next call the attention of our readers to a few particular alphabets, not
                    perhaps with so much minuteness as some might desire, nor certainly to all that
                    arc worthy of attention. The Greek alphabet is by far the most important to
                    literature, not only because the most precious remains of antiquity .have been
                    preserved by its means, but because it is the parent of the Latin, which has
                    been adopted by, and prevails amongst, the most civilized nations of the world.
                    Plate XIX., which is the first of the three plates connected with this subject,
                    is entirely devoted to elucidate its origin and history. The plate has been
                    taken, except that part on the right hand which is headed “Greek,” from Astle’s
                    work on the <hi rend="italic">Origin and Progress of Writing,</hi> and was
                    compiled from authorities which we regret that it would greatly exceed our
                    limits to enumerate. It would be easy to extract the passages which would
                    explain it; but as the book is generally accessible, we will content ourselves
                    by referring to it; and as that admirable treasure of alphabetic lore, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouveau Traite</hi><hi rend="italic">de Diplomatique</hi> (6
                    tom.4to, Paris, 1750-65), whence Astle has chiefly derived his authorities and
                    the forms of the letters, may easily be consulted, we will not avail ourselves
                    of the assistance it would afford. Joseph Sca-liger was the first who
                    endeavoured to show systematically, and with elaborate learning, the derivation
                    of the Greek letters from the Phoenician. He has had many followers and
                    imitators. A cursory inspection of the numerous specimens of Phoenician letters
                    which this plate affords will prove, that if their forms are sometimes like
                    those of the ancient Greek characters, they are often very dissimilar, at least
                    if we may suppose that we have obtained from coms and inscriptions the true
                    characters of the Phoenicians; and if the powers of the letters were the same as
                    in the Hebrew, aš the order appears to have been, there was a great
                    dissimilarity in sound also. That portion of the plate which is headed “Greek”
                    is taken from a plate inscribed <hi rend="italic">Varice Alphabeti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Greeci per actatis</hi><hi rend="italic">ordinem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">formoe,</hi> published in the <hi rend="italic">Poecilographia
                    Groeca</hi> of Hodgkin, and in vol. ix. of the <hi rend="italic">Classical
                    Journal.</hi> The first column on the left consists of the ordinary letters, of
                    which the number is increased to 27 by the insertion of the Fαυ <hi
                    rend="italic">iπiGnμοv,</hi> which marks the number 6, after E, of <hi
                    rend="italic">ΰανiti,</hi> 900, and of κo≡rα, 90, after Π. The second column is
                    headed “Cadmi A. c. 1500,” and is taken from Morton. The next column, standing
                    immediately below “Greek,” gives the various forms of the Sigean inscription, as
                    published by Chishull, and is headed “Sigcum, circa 600 A. c.” The third column
                    is inscribed “Simonidis, A. c. 500,” and is also from Morton. The remainder of
                    the letters are of the date 450, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> c., and are given
                    on the authority of Wachter, from W. Massey’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on the
                    Origin and Progress of Letters.</hi> Mr Hodgkin has published in the same work a
                    large and valuable collection of abbreviations and connections. The fac-similés
                    of the Herculanean papyri present the Greek characters that were in ordinary use
                    at the time when they were written. Μ. d’Agincourt, in his valuable <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’Art par les Monumens,</hi> has
                    given many curious examples of Greek manuscripts of the middle ages, extracted
                    from the unpublished treasures of the Vatican library; and Mr Rose has
                    collected, with much care and accuracy, the various forms of letters from
                    inscriptions at Athens and in Attica. It would be easy to multiply references to
                    other volumes. Although the philologist may not accept all Mr Payne Knight’s
                    conclusions, as they are presented in his well-known <hi rend="italic">Analysis
                    of the Greek Alphabet,</hi> he cannot refuse him credit for much learning and
                    ingenuity, for novelty sometimes amounting to paradox, and an energy often
                    approaching to anger. The two learned dissertations of Μ. l’abbé Renaudot, in
                    the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Academy of
                    Inscriptions,</hi> are well known. It is impossible not to remark, that,
                    whenever a new inscription is discovered, archaeologists instantly fly to it,
                    and for a time, commonly until something else is turned up, endeavour to solve
                    every phenomenon by means of it. This fickleness is undoubtedly suspicious, and
                    resembles the conduct of men who are ill at ease in their theories. The letters
                    which we find on coins and marbles of the earliest periods are only of certain
                    peculiar forms; but it would be a rash deduction to infer, therefore, that they
                    did not use letters of a different shape for other purposes. These have
                    remained, because the materials on which they were impressed or engraven were
                    durable; and the cursive writing, which probably existed and was inscribed on
                    perishable substances, and for temporary purposes, has been lost. If all
                    lettered monuments of the 19th century had disappeared except our money, the
                    inference would be most erroneous, that the inhabitants of Great Britain knew no
                    other characters save the Roman capitals, which are alone to be found on the
                    sovereign; and will seem ridiculous to all who are aware that the bank-note that
                    circulates with it presents evidence of its mercantile origin, specimens of
                    every kind of hand which an ambitious schoolmaster, anxious to display his
                    penmanship, could devise.</p>
                <p>On the Greek alphabet, as on many others, the question arises, What is properly
                    to be considered a letter? If <hi rend="superscript"> we</hi> accept the
                    ordinary definition, that it is a mark for a certain known sound, it is plain
                    that <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is entitled to the honourable appellation. The
                    Romans include it in the alphabet, and, except perhaps in prosody, grant to it
                    all its rights.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193036920" xml:id="kp-eb0702-6920-0547"/>
                <p>By most of the nations of the west it is duly recognised, and by the orientals it
                    is usually had in great honour. The Greeks, however, have attenuated it into a
                    spirit, and translated it, as such, out of the alphabet, and elevated it above
                    the heads of its fellows. The practice of sending letters aloft, that were
                    supposed to have a turn for climbing, exists indeed in many other languages. The
                    two dots or lines, for instance, that sometimes hang over the vowels in the
                    German, are the remains of <hi rend="italic">e;</hi> thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >pökel</hi> was formerly written <hi rend="italic">pockel</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and some grammarians have recommended that the old orthography should be
                    resumed. It is unnecessary to multiply examples from other tongues. This letter
                    was anciently marked by the sign H, as in the Latin and our own language. When
                    that sign was applied to denote the <hi rend="italic">η,</hi> it was cut in two,
                    and one half was suspended in the air to mark the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spiritus</hi><hi rend="italic">asper,</hi> the rough breathing, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> which, according to the definition, is a letter; the other
                    half was hung up in the same manner for a very peculiar purpose, not to
                    designate any letter, not as the mark of any known sound, but, under the name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">spiritus lenis,</hi> it signified the absence of a
                    letter—it became a negative sign in grammatical algebra. Since the <hi
                    rend="italic">spiritus lenis</hi> merely imports the absence of the <hi
                    rend="italic">spiritus asper,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> if a sign be
                    used to show the absence of one letter, there ought equally to be a sign to
                    denote that of every other letter in the alphabet; and on this principle there
                    ought to be as many negative as positive signs. If it be supposed that the
                    reader who sees the word <hi rend="italic">all</hi> cannot understand that the
                    word does not begin with <hi rend="italic">lι,</hi> and is not <hi rend="italic"
                    >hall,</hi> unless a spirit tell him so, and a mark be .prefixed to signify that
                    the word <hi rend="italic">all</hi> does not begin with <hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi> he must need the like assistance to enable him to comprehend that every
                    other letter also is wanting. He ought to be told that the word <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> does not begin with <hi rend="italic">b, c, d,</hi>
                    &amp;c. and that it is not <hi rend="italic">ball,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic"
                    >call,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">pall,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">tall.</hi>
                    Since the initial is not more intelligible than the remainder of the word, every
                    other letter of every word ought on the same principle to be preceded by the
                    negative signs of all the letters, to show that it is nothing more than itself.
                    To such absurdities must we be reduced, if we abandon the plain rule, that the
                    absence of a letter alone is sufficient to show that it is wanting. We should
                    wonder the more that a people so intelligent as the Greeks should have fallen
                    into such an error, if, as far as we know, Lanzi had not been the first to
                    notice it. His <hi rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad absurdum</hi>
                    of the <hi rend="italic">spiritus lenis</hi> has not hitherto received the
                    attention which its acuteness merits. In Arabic, the mark <hi rend="italic"
                    >gesma,</hi> unless we look upon it as representing the hyphen, is also a
                    negative sign, importing, however, a more extensive negation. It has been
                    conjectured that the Greek accentual marks were contrived to assist persons in
                    reading aloud, before the practice of leaving a space at the end of each word
                    was adopted. They certainly would be extremely useful in this respect, and they
                    afford great help in perusing a manuscript written continuously. For this
                    purpose the spirits are more useful than the accents; for they show that the
                    vowels oyer which they are placed are initials,—ignorance whereof is a fertile
                    source of ambiguity; and for this purpose the <hi rend="italic">spiritus
                    lenis</hi> is as necessary as the aspirate. The latter is a letter, and an
                    orthographical mark besides; the former is only a mark that the E begins another
                    word, as in me example KAIEΓ∩, which is equivalent to KAI EΓ∩, me sign 4 being
                    equal to the space between the two words. It was afterwards usual to place a
                    period after each word, as a spirit general affecting equally vowels .
                    consonants, thus, KAI.EΓ∩.AEΓ∩; and this expedient is applicable to all words:
                    and many manuscripts that were written continuously have received the convenient
                    addition at a time long subsequent to the date of the writing If we consider the
                    <hi rend="italic">spiritus lenis</hi> in this point of view, the inventors of it
                    will be exculpated from the absurdity of which Lanzi sought to convict them, and
                    it will attach to those grammarians only who retained the mark after the
                    practice of leaving a space at the end of every word became prevalent. We must
                    esteem the Greek accents and spirits, especially if we acquiesce in this theory
                    of their invention, as venerable relics of antiquity—as contrivances which have
                    been superseded. On this account, and from habit, it is difficult for a scholar
                    to consent to abandon them, or to rest satisfied with a work, however well
                    printed it may be in other respects, in which they are omitted.</p>
                <p>Orthographical expedients to facilitate reading are numerous and ingenious, as
                    spaces, punctuation, capitals for proper names and at the beginning of
                    sentences, the apostrophe, and many others. It would be an interesting pursuit
                    to trace their origin and history. Much attention has always been paid to
                    reading and writing by the Christians, the Jews, the Mahometans, and, in short,
                    by all nations whose religion is comprehended in ancient writings. Among the
                    Greeks and Romans, little of their worship had been reduced into writing, nor
                    did they profess to be in possession of a code of divine laws, like the Koran
                    and similar volumes that are studied, transcribed, and venerated, by the
                    orientals. The reverence that Alexander the Great displayed for the poems of
                    Homer, remarkable as it appeared to his contemporaries, was but a faint shadow
                    of the homage and adoration that the people of the East lavish on their sacred
                    volumes. The treatment which the Sibylline books received at Rome was perhaps in
                    some respects similar; but they were not publicly read; the grand object,
                    indeed, of those in whose custody they were placed being, although they were not
                    wanting in veneration for the prophetic volumes, to conceal, and not to publish,
                    their mysterious contents. We cheerfully acknowledge that the religion of Greece
                    and Rome, as a political institution, had ņiany important advantages; but it is
                    not to be denied that it was less favourable to the diffusion of reading and
                    writing than Christianity and some of the religions of the East. The
                    translations of the Scriptures have preserved for the philologer many curious
                    fragments of languages, of which there are no other remains. In pagan Rome, as
                    in Greece, public recitation and reading aloud were practised to a great extent;
                    but these exercises were always performed by persons of some learning, and of
                    considerable experience, who were comparatively few in number. When the
                    Christians increased, public readers were greatly augmented: it became necessary
                    to read the Scriptures, homilies, and other pious compositions, not only to
                    learned men in cities, but to the poor and ignorant in the most obscure villages
                    of the most remote provinces; and this office was commonly performed by men of
                    extremely moderate attainments. It became expedient, therefore, to devise every
                    contrivance that could facilitate the task of reading in public. The Biblical
                    critic knows, that we owe to this cause many orthographical advantages, which
                    are now commonly enjoyed, although the source of them is not generally
                    understood. We are unable, however, to pursue this part of the subject at
                    present; nor can we find leisure to trace our ordinary running-hand. It may be
                    followed step by step from the Greek cursive, in such works as the <hi

                    similar publications. The Arabic alphabet, which, especially in the hands of the
                    Persians, seems expressly designed to favour rapid writers, has six
                    unconnectible letters; and when the Greek characters are written in
                    running-hand, there are several letters which may not be joined, some with those
                    that precede, others with those that follow. In our cursive every letter in
                    every word maybe united; but as it was first adapted to the Latin language, the
                    School-boy who has written even a theme in that tongue must have remarked that
                    the letters unite more easily and pleasantly than in English.</p>
                <p>&lt; The second plate (No. XX.) presents a comparative table of hieroglyphic and
                    alphabetic characters. We cannot dwell upon this very singular assemblage of
                    signs and symbols, or point out in detail the absurdity of the theories which
                    would deduce alphabetic writing from the Egyptian hieroglyphics; but it will
                    manifest itself most strikingly and plainly, and without prejudice, to an
                    intelligent person who will examine attentively this table, which has been
                    arranged expressly for the purpose of presenting an untenable and unfounded
                    hypothesis in the least unfavourable light. The first column on the left, headed
                    “Chaldaic Letters,” contains an alphabet which is so important in the history of
                    literature, that we must not pass it over without some notice. The Chaldaic or
                    Hebrew alphabet consists of 22 consonants, of which the forms are given on the
                    extreme left of the comparative table, and their powers on the extreme right,
                    and of 14 vowel points, making a total of 36 letters, if we may reckon the
                    points, which are held to be less ancient than the consonants, and are often
                    omitted in manuscripts and printed books, as letters. There are, besides, in a
                    great number, accentual and other marks, designed to facilitate reading, and
                    sometimes perhaps chanting or singing. Of some of these, however, the use is not
                    at present understood; our business is with the 22 consonants only, and with
                    their forms. The third letter, <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> is called Gimel, which
                    signifies the camel. <hi rend="italic">Camelus</hi><hi rend="italic">suo
                    nomine</hi><hi rend="italic">Syriaco</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Latium venit,</hi> as Varro elegantly writes. There can be no
                    doubt about the derivation of the animal’s name, but the letter is as much like
                    any other creature as a camel. Pe, the 17th letter, is called the mouth: it
                    resembles the nose or the eyes equally. And the letter that immediately precedes
                    it, as its name implies, is thought to be a picture of the eye; but it is as
                    faithful a representation of any other feature, or even of the whole face. The
                    ingenuity of the engraver could not humour the appearance of the teeth so as to
                    make it remind us, as it ought, of the last letter but one—Shin. A very learned
                    Rabbi, from whom we formerly received, some instruction in Hebrew, gravely
                    affirmed that the letter Pe, the mouth, is the true image; of that organ; and
                    that if it had not been the Sabbath, he would have written it, and shown,
                    moreover, that there is a piece of pudding in it. Being offered a dry pen, that
                    he might point it out hi a book, he refused to do even that act. Such a severe
                    observance of the day of rest appeared very surprising to persons unacquainted
                    with the strict literal interpretation that prevails in the East. He consented
                    indeed to explain by words that the piece of pudding is that mark which is
                    inserted in the 17th letter, Pe, and serves to distinguish it from the 11th
                    letter, Caph. The learned Jew, however, did not regard consistency in his
                    explanation, nor do these ingenious people in general; for Caph is the palm of
                    the hand; and by placing a piece of pudding in it, although it would probably be
                    more welcome to the mouth, it would not be made to resemble it in form. Jod,
                    which immediately precedes Caph, is the hand also; and these letters are equally
                    unlike the hand and each other. We will not speak longer, however, of this
                    miserable" nonsense: the immense load of absurdity would soon become
                    intolerable, if, in passing through several languages, we were to pick up in
                    each some new extravagance. It is true that the names of the greater part, if
                    not all, of the Hebrew letters, signify visible objects; but it does not follow
                    that the letter ever resembled in form the object of which it bears the name.
                    Nouns are used in the second intention without regard to shape; neither the
                    horse for drying clothes, nor the dogs on which wood is burned, nor the cock of
                    a barrel, nor a crow-bar, will remind us of any of the animals that lend them
                    titles; nor do we ever see a boot-tree or a saddle-tree flourishing, like real
                    trees, with leaves, flowers, and fruit If we were to teach that our letter B
                    derives its form and name from the insect, and that our alphabet, if considered
                    in the same manner, would furnish a key to the Egyptian hieroglyphics, and would
                    explain the origin of writing, we should not trifle more egregiously than
                    certain expositors of the Hebrew characters.</p>
                <p>Our third and last plate (No. XXI.) comprehends specimens of some remarkable
                    alphabets. We will treat them in the order in which they stand. In the Syriac,
                    the number and order of the letters are the same as in the Hebrew, and their
                    names and powers are nearly the same also. The row of characters on the right is
                    that square writing which is called Estranghelo. The letters in the next row are
                    commonly termed Chaldee. Many of them resemble the former, and some are
                    different. The open letters are the same as the first row, except that they are
                    formed with greater regularity, and are more square. The remaining four columns
                    consist of the ordinary Syriac letters, varying more or less in form from the
                    Estranghelo, and arranged from the right to the left in order, as initial,
                    medial, final, and solitary letters. Of these alphabets, the Estranghelo is the
                    most ancient and solemn. Some maintain that the Hebrew Scriptures were
                    originally written in this hand. It corresponds in its origin and use with the
                    Roman capitals, which we esteem older than the small letters, and now use only
                    for titles, inscriptions, and the like. The second column, or Chaldee, is called
                    also the reformed Syriac, being a medium between the Estranghelo and the
                    ordinary Syriac. Vowel points are added to these letters; but it is acknowledged
                    that the use of them, in this language at least, is entirely modern. The
                    Illyrian and Servian alphabets are evidently derived from the Greek: <hi
                    rend="italic">Groeco</hi><hi rend="italic">fonte cadunt</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> we cannot add, however, <hi rend="italic">ρθree</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >detorta:</hi> the order of the letters is the same, many being inserted. The
                    two rows of letters on the left, which are usually very like the Greek
                    originals, are the Servian, and are commonly called the alphabet of St Cyril,
                    being ascribed to that saint. The other two rows of letters, which are, as it
                    were, double, and frequently of an extraordinary form, are’ the Illyrian, or
                    Dalmatian, and are named the alphabet of St Jerome. We are apt to wonder why the
                    good father should have taken so much trouble, if he was indeed the inventor, to
                    disfigure the elements of speech. The appearance of the Illyrian, when we see an
                    entire passage in this character, is still more strange: it ı&amp; impossible
                    indeed to judge of its effect from a mere table of letters. We regret,
                    therefore, that pur space will not suffer us to. give a specimen of this
                    whimsical and unusual writing. The. Russian alphabets, both ancient and modern,
                    are formed from the Greek, by additions and altera <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193036946" xml:id="kp-eb0702-6946-0549"/>tions, the order of the
                    letters being nearly the same. The Ethiopic alphabet, which occupies the middle
                    of the plate, is extremely interesting, because it is said to be a great and
                    important step in the history of writing; and it is expressly referred to by the
                    very learned President Goguet, as a specimen of a syllabic alphabet: “rectius
                    syllaba-rium quam alphabetum.” Syllabic writing, if it ever existed, would not
                    be a step from hieroglyphic to alphabetic writing: it would be a kind of
                    alphabetic writing, in which the alphabet would be very numerous, and the sounds
                    expressed by each letter complex; but it would have no connection with
                    hieroglyphics; the pretended link would be united to the chain at one end, but
                    not at the other. If we suppose <hi rend="italic">prosterner,</hi> the word
                    chosen by Goguet, to be represented by three letters only, each of which is a
                    syllable, as cr&lt;jv, the w, which stands for <hi rend="italic">pro,</hi> would
                    mark a complex sound, but it would not be in any respect hieroglyphic. It would
                    not denote a sensible object or an idea, and so of the other two syllabic
                    letters <hi rend="italic">β</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and of all the
                    rest. The conjecture would appear probable in itself, that syllabic characters
                    are compounded of other and less complex forms; nor is the" aspect of the
                    alphabets that are put forth as belonging to this class so simple as to exclude
                    the supposition. It is easy in the Ethiopic to trace the vowel which is added
                    with tolerable uniformity to the simple letter. There are a few anomalies, no
                    doubt, as in the grammatical arrangements of all languages. Ţhe first column on
                    the left, next to the name, shows the simple letter. It is not combined with the
                    vowel <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> as it,would seem at first sight; for that union
                    is effected in the fourth or middle column. A moment’s inspection of this
                    alphabet and table of syllables will satisfy any one that it is composed of 26
                    consonants—we must use the word in an eastern sense—combined with six vowels,
                    precisely like the tables ba, be, bi, bo, bu, by, &amp;c., in our
                    spelling-books; and that it does not in any respect resemble the case which is
                    put by Goguet, of the word <hi rend="italic">prosterner</hi> being spelled by
                    three letters. As the Sanscrit alphabet is not shown on our plates, we will not
                    analyze it to prove that it is not to be considered as syllabic. The Persian is
                    as much entitled to that appellation, because the junction of the letters being
                    often difficult, they» write, for the assistance of learners, books full of
                    syllables. It is not by steps built of such materials as these that we can hope
                    to ascend to the origin of that most wonderful invention, the alphabet. The
                    Ethiopic is derived from the Arabic: it is a dead language, like the Latin, and
                    it is called the language of study, or the language of books: the Abyssinian, or
                    Amharic, so called from Amhar, the principal province of Abyssinia, and termed
                    the royal language, has taken its place as a living speech; and seven letters
                    have been added to the 26 of the Ethiopic alphabet, which we have given. These
                    two languages may be studied in the grammars of Job Ludolphus, who tells us that
                    they are of difficult acquisition, and declares the words to be exceedingly
                    unutterable— “maxime esse ineffabilia.” The aspect of the characters, when
                    arranged in words and sentences, is uncouth and unsightly: they somewhat
                    resemble the Tironian notes, which, although their appearance is unpromising,
                    were written, as we are informed by positive testimony, with great rapidity.
                    Contractions, abbreviations, and connections, far from indicating that writing
                    is in an imperfect Condition, evince that penmanship is far advanced.</p>
                <p>The Armenian alphabet consists of 38 letters. They have several other kinds of
                    writing. We have given that which is called the round hand, and is used in
                    printed books. Like ourselves, they write from the left to the right. The
                    appearance of their printed books is neat and agreeable. The leaning of the
                    letters was perhaps learned from the Italic, which was chiefly used by the
                    printers of Venice. The greatest benefactors’ to their literature and typography
                    have been the congregation of Armenian monks, who resided at Methone in the
                    Peloponnesus, and afterwards removed to Venice. This language possesses a few
                    original works, but is chiefly rich in translations from the writings of St
                    Chrysostom and other Greek fathers, which have improved and refined it. Those
                    who are curious on the subject may consult the dissertation of Schröder, <hi

                    commonly somewhat lighter than our engraved alphabet of 36 letters. The
                    Georgians write also from the left, and have several kinds of writing. The plate
                    represents the ordinary hand. The Coptic language derives its name from Coptos,
                    á city of Upper Egypt, where it was chiefly spoken. It is said to be a mixture
                    of Greek with the ancient language of Egypt, Ethiopic, and the old Persian. The
                    alphabet, which is borrowed from the Greek, superseded the use of the older
                    letters in Egypt, as the characters introduced by Cadmus possibly took the place
                    of those that were used by the Greeks before his time. The names, figures, and
                    order of the letters, are the same as in Greek. Eight letters were added to
                    express sounds unknown to the Greeks. Seven of these follow the omega; psi is
                    put out of its place, being the last letter; and r, under the name So, is duly
                    inserted after the epsilon. This tongue has attracted some little attention, in
                    consequence of the phonetic system, of which we have spoken. A full and handsome
                    grammar was published at Rome in 1778, by the Society <hi rend="italic">de
                    propaganda Fide.</hi> The examples are given in Arabic, as well as Coptic. The
                    Gothic alphabet of the patriarch Ulphilas, which is the last of our specimens,
                    was formed in part from the' Latin, and in part from the Greek: the letters are
                    arranged in the order of the former language. We know not whether certain
                    theorists will consider the double letters at the end as syllabic characters.
                    The Runic alphabet is interesting from its connection with Scandinavian
                    antiquities. It is nearly identical with the Icelandic: the letters are copied
                    from the Greek and Roman, being a little varied for the sake of notching them
                    more conveniently on sticks or staves; but the order of the sixteen letters is
                    very different from both these alphabets. There are many specimens in Hickes’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus.</hi> These letters have afforded much scope for
                    controversy. Those who are most favourable to the antiquity of the Runic
                    inscriptions assign to them nearly 2000 years. Olaus Rud-bechius teaches that
                    the Greeks used these letters before the time of Cadmus. Those who are least so
                    say that they are not older than the third century of our era.</p>
                <p>The best kind of Anglo-Saxon writing was very elegant; the small round characters
                    that we see m charters are neat and extremely legible. Domesday book is written
                    in a hand less perfect, but somewhat similar. After the Norman conquest writing
                    deteriorated in England, and became quaint, affected, and illegible. In
                    proportion as a nation is civilized or barbarous, the pronunciation of its
                    language, it has been maintained, varies from the orthography. In the Celtic
                    languages the variation is prodigious; in our own tongue it is very
                    considerable; in the Anglo-Saxon, so far as we are able to judge, it was much
                    less. That language was assiduously cultivated before the conquest, especially
                    in poetry; many poems were composed, and in extremely difficult and complicated
                    metres. After that event French became the language of the aristocracy; and the
                    Saxon <pb break="no" facs="nls:193036959" xml:id="kp-eb0702-6959-0550"/>or
                    English was long neglected, and was spoken only by the vulgar, for a long
                    period, during which the foundations of our present orthography were laid.</p>
                <p>The Irish claim “an exorbitant antiquity” for their tree alphabet, in which the
                    order of the letters is peculiar, and the name of each of them is borrowed from
                    some tree. B, under the name Beith, which signifies a birchtree, is the first of
                    them: it is fit that the tree of knowledge should lead the band. This alphabet
                    is commonly allowed to be a modern fabrication: a few antiquaries, however, are
                    ready to maintain that it is many centuries older than the creation. In most
                    languages words are pronounced in a manner somewhat different from that in which
                    they are written; but in the Irish the aberration of the sound from the spelling
                    is so great, that the only use of letters seems to be, to show how words are not
                    pronounced by omitting all that are really wanted, and inserting all but the
                    right. As straight lines placed in different positions will form most of the
                    letters of the Roman alphabet, so the various arrangement of lines, shaped like
                    wedges or the heads of arrows, would make a sufficient variety of characters not
                    altogether dissimilar to tfie Roman. Two of them inclining towards each other at
                    the bottom would be V, one wedge at right angles to another might represent L,
                    and three might be so placed as to designate either F or H. It is not necessary
                    to pursue the subject farther. The structure of the arrow-headed, cuneiform, or
                    ancient Persian alphabet, must be already sufficiently intelligible.
                    Inscriptions in this character, which perhaps was also esteemed sacred, closely
                    resemble the Runic Ogham, represented in General Vallancey’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The twenty-five instructive and excellent plates in the second volume of the
                    Collection of Plates, published with the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédie,</hi> contain many curious specimens of alphabets. They are taken,
                    however, almost entirely and without acknowledgement, after the manner of the
                    French literati, from the valuable publications of the Society <hi rend="italic"
                    >de propaganda Fide</hi> at Rome. Μ. du Marsais, the writer of the article on
                    the alphabet in that <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie,</hi> evinces a passionate
                    desire to regenerate the world—such was the taste of the age —and strenuously
                    recommends a new alphabet: had it been adopted, according to his advice, we
                    should undoubtedly be using the old one at the present day. The numerous
                    publications of the Society we have mentioned well deserve attention; and many
                    curious alphabets are given in Niebuhr’s <hi rend="italic">Travels,</hi> and in
                    other works that we need not enumerate. We have spoken already of the
                    advancement which the arts of reading and writing have received from religion:
                    we will mention a very remarkable and important alphabet, which derived its
                    origin and its general diffusion from the same source. The Arabic letters are
                    said to be the invention of the unfortunate Vizier Moclah, who flourished at the
                    beginning of the 10th century, and lost at different times, for political
                    offences, his right hand, which had thrice copied the Koran, his left hand, and
                    his tongue; cruel privations for a man of letters and an elegant penman. The
                    Cuphic, a most grave and goodly character, appears to stand in the same
                    venerable relation of paternity to the Arabic, as the Estranghelo to the vulgar
                    Syriac. In the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights,</hi> that faithful mirror of
                    eastern manners, we find that the second Calender, who was a king’s son, after
                    describing his critical knowledge of the Koran, and of the commentaries on “that
                    blessed book,” boasts of his excellent penmanship thus: “But one thing, which I
                    highly admired and succeeded in to admiration, was to form the characters of our
                    Arabian language, wherein. I surpassed all the writing-masters of our kingdom
                    that had acquired the greatest reputation.” The Arabic character, especially as
                    it has been modified by the Persians, who have added to it much elegance, with
                    some affectation, is not only favourable to the most daring flights of the pen,
                    but in an eminent degree also to rapid execution. Wherever the Koran penetrated
                    it was received, and it superseded the older and more tedious modes of writing.
                    This alphabet consists of twenty-eight or twenty-nine letters, for it is a
                    question whether <hi rend="italic">Lam-alif</hi> is to be accounted a letter;
                    but it has as much right to the title as ψ, and some others in the Greek
                    alphabet, and it can plead a proverb in its favour, “from alif to lam-alif”
                    being exactly equivalent to “from alpha to omega.” For twenty-eight or
                    twenty-nine letters there are only seventeen primary figures, and these perhaps
                    may be reduced to fifteen; and the letters of which the figures are similar are
                    distinguished by the number and position of certain dots, which are called
                    diacritical or distinctive points. It is precisely as if a numeral were added,
                    as a co-efficient, to a letter in order to change its power entirely (we refer
                    to this alphabet without a plate, as being generally known): thus, lb is b, but
                    2b perhaps is j, 3b is n, 4b is t, and 5b is th; again, 1f is f, but 2f is k,
                    and so with the rest. It is impossible to conceive a more clumsy device, Or one
                    more fruitful in mistakes, especially as they are distinguished, not by
                    numerals, but by dots, which are easily omitted or misapplied. The Persians have
                    added four more letters, by means of additional dots, without introducing a new
                    figure. They content themselves, nevertheless, with a smaller number than the
                    Arabs, and the same as the Greeks, for the purposes of their own tongue; never
                    using eight of the letters except in words adopted from the Arabic. Thus, with
                    the Romans k, y, and z, held offices in the foreign department only. The
                    Persians vary the character in many hands, some of which are very beautiful,
                    others very legible, and others very rapid. The Indians, when they write in the
                    Arabic character, increase the number by three more letters, which they
                    distinguish by additional points. The order of the Arabic letters has been
                    changed; for their numerical value is the same as that of the twenty-two
                    equivalent letters in the Hebrew, the six letters that have been added differ in
                    their points only, and not in figure. It is a remarkable difference, that in the
                    languages of the East, at least in that family which is called Semitic, the
                    vowels are not expressed, but only the consonants. On the contrary, in all the
                    languages of the West, the vowels and consonants enter equally into the
                    composition of the writing. Besides the twenty-eight or twenty-nine letters,
                    eleven other marks are used in the Arabic. In the Semitic family the vowels are
                    not of the essence of the word, the radical meaning resides entirely in the
                    consonants, and so is it also in the Teutonic tongues. In our own we have, for
                    example, <hi rend="italic">sang, sing, song,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sung,</hi> and innumerable other instances. Whatever may have been, therefore,
                    the parent of the Greek, it is impossible to agree with Colonel Vans Kennedy,
                    who maintains in his late work <hi rend="italic">On the Origin of
                    Languages,</hi> that the Teutonic tongues are the offspring of the Sanscrit, in
                    which the vowels are radicals.</p>
                <p>It has been conjectured with some ingenuity, but without foundation, that the
                    Arabic characters in which the vowels are not expressed were invented for the
                    common use of several dialects, in which the consonants alone were determined in
                    an invariable manner, and the pronunciation of the vowels varied. They have
                    certainly been applied thus, but they were invented to facilitate those who
                    transcribed the pure Arabic of the Koran, as the Hebrew letters were used
                    without points to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193036972"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-6972-0551"/>copy the Jewish law. Abbreviations and simple
                    characters, that are of easy formation, are not merely advantageous to the
                    reporter, but are useful also to the man of fetters, for instantly catching the
                    warm thought as it issues from the imagination; and perhaps also as a cipher,
                    that the rash surmise, the first hasty impression, may not be exposed to the
                    rude gaze of those who, never being original themselves, never give birth to
                    errors, and accordingly are intolerant of them in others. Short-hand, therefore,
                    independently of its ingenuity, is so useful, that it deserves notice in an
                    essay on the alphabet; but we refer to it only to illustrate the Arabic. The use
                    of an extremely simple character, which is very cursive, and joins easily, and
                    of many contractions, and the total omission, in languages like our own, where
                    they are not radical, of all the vowels, are the means by which the short-hand
                    writer attains to expedition. These are the wings on which his pen flies; they
                    are the characteristics also of the Arabic alphabet. Let us suppose that all
                    Great Britain was smitten with an immense love of writing—printing being still
                    unknown—and that it was deemed the chief good to copy as much as possible; that
                    for this purpose all men learned short-hand, and, finding that it increased
                    their powers, and the passion continuing, laid aside all the ordinary hands, so
                    that they were forgotten. Such was the origin of the Arabic writing. When the
                    shorthand writer would make his writing more legible, he adds the more important
                    vowels by dots, and by various diacritical marks resolves ambiguities and clears
                    up difficulties. If it were necessary to explain it to children and to
                    strangers, and to interpret the abbreviations of distant times—and it would be
                    were stenography universal— many orthographical signs would be required, whereby
                    men would in truth return to the course which they had formerly quitted. Such
                    was the origin of the vowel points and their adjuncts.</p>
                <p>When we reflect that we have the very words of Socrates, as he spoke them, unless
                    Plato and Xenophon have deceived us, we cannot wonder, since the power of
                    letters is really so great, that men have sometimes attributed to them a little
                    more influence than they possess. Hence originated the belief in magical spells,
                    and charms, and characters; and certain mysterious properties were assigned to
                    writing, not only amongst the Pagans, but by many of the Christians. It is
                    somewhat remarkable that it has always been the practice from the earliest times
                    and it still prevails in Catholic countries, for the bishop’ when he consecrates
                    a church (the order of this ancient and venerable rite may be read in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pontificale),</hi> to inscribe twice on the pavement, in the form
                    of a cross, all the letters of the Roman alphabet. History assigns’ the highest
                    antiquity to the most precious art of alphabetic writing. The author of the book
                    of Job was familiar with it. Moses speaks of it constantly in the Pentateuch,
                    and he acquired his human learning in Egypt, where it was necessarily well known
                    at that time. The better opinion seems to be, that although Cadmus, the
                    contemporary of Joshua, introduced an alphabet into Greece, which was accepted
                    there, it was only taken in exchange for that which had been previously in use.
                    Josephus, it is true, with his usual desire to exalt his own nation and its laws
                    at the expense of the Gentiles, asserts, without hesitation, that letters were
                    unknown in Greece even in the time of Homer, and to Homer himself; and some of
                    the fathers of the church, who piously but unfairly endeavoured to degrade the
                    learning of the Greeks, accepted the assertion as well founded. The startling
                    paradox of the Jew, whose nationality has been less doubted than his veracity,
                    has been maintained, at different periods, with much ingenuity: it is capable,
                    however, of an easy refutation. The more diligently we inquire, the more ample
                    and unequivocal shall we find the testimony of history to be in favour of the
                    antiquity of alphabetic writing, and also, as reason alone teaches us, that no
                    other ever existed.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian hieroglyphics, the Chinese characters, and the supposed syllabic
                    alphabets, have been examined, and they do not afford, as is commonly asserted,
                    any clue to lead us to the invention of the alphabet. Since we are unable,
                    either in history or even in imagination, to trace the origin of the alphabet,
                    we must ascribe it, with the Rabbins, who are prepared with authenticated copies
                    of the characters they used, and of those of Seth, Enoch, and Noah, to the first
