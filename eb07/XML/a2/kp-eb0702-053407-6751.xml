                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ALMEYDA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Don Francis</hi></label>, was
                    the son of the count d’Abrantes, a grandee of Portugal, who served with great
                    distinction in the war of Ferdinand of Castile with Granada; and in consequence
                    of his important services he became highly esteemed in the court of his
                    sovereign. Without any solicitation on his part he was nominated* the first
                    governor-general and viceroy of the newly conquered countries in the East
                    Indies, and set sail from Lisbon in March 1505-6 with a powerful fleet. To give
                    dignity and influence to his elevated station, a body of guards was appointed to
                    attend his person, several chaplains were assigned to him, together with every
                    other appendage of grandeur. He touched at the Cape Verde islands, doubled the
                    cape at a considerable distance to the south, and arrived at Guiloa. From thence
                    he proceeded to Mombaza, a well-fortified city in an island, which he reduced,
                    and proceeded to the Angediva islands, not far from Goa, where he built a fort:
                    he likewise erected and garrisoned another fort at Cananore, and arriving at
                    Cochin, he secured it to the Portuguese interest. The island of Madagascar was
                    discovered during his government; and his son Don Lorenzo first surveyed the
                    Maidive islands, and about the same time discovered the fine island of Ceylon,
                    the principal sovereign of which he brought under submission to the crown of
                    Portugal. Returning from this expedition, while employed in the fleet destined
                    against Calicut, he lost his life in a sea-fight against the Zamorin. His father
                    sustained his loss with an heroic firmness, saying that “Lorenzo could not
                    diejbetter than in the service of his country.” On the arrival of Alphonso
                    d’Albuquerque, who was destined to be his successor, Almeyda yielded to the
                    impressions of jealousy; and under the pretence of misconduct he confined him in
                    the citadel of Cananore. He engaged in 1508 the whole force of the Mahometans in
                    the port of Diu; and, gaining a complete victory, facilitated the enterprises of
                    Albuquerque his successor, by contributing to break that formidable league by
                    which the Zamorin was in hopes of being able to compel the Portuguese to abandon
                    their Indian conquests. Returning home with the great riches which he had
                    acquired, he unfortunately touched at Saldanha Point, on the coast of Africa,
                    where some of the sailors, in quest of water, quarrelled with the natives, who
                    attacked and drove them to their ships. With a view to revenge this pretended
                    affront, they persuaded Almeydá himself to go ashore, with a body of 150 men,
                    armed only with swords and lances. While stepping into the boat, Almeyda
                    exclaimed, “Whither do you carry my 60 years ?” The Portuguese furiously rushed
                    on to attack the natives, whose numbers were greatly augmented; and Almeyda,
                    with fifty-seven of his men, was killed in this rash and unprovoked attempt.</p>
