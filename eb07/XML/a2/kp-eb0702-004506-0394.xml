                <p><label type="entry">ABSTINENCE</label>, in a general sense, the act or habit of
                    refraining from something to which there is a strong propensity. Among the Jews,
                    various kinds of abstinence were ordained by their law. The Pythagoreans, when
                    initiated, were enjoined to abstain from animal food, except the remains of
                    sacrifices; and to drink nothing but water, unless in the evening, when they
                    were permitted to take a small portion of wine. Among the primitive Christians,
                    some denied themselves the use of such meats as were prohibited by that law,
                    others regarded this abstinence with contempt; of which St Paul gives his
                    opinion, Rom. xiv. 1-3. The council of Jerusalem, which was held by the
                    apostles, enjoined the Christian converts to abstain from meats strangled, from
                    blood, from fornication, and from idolatry. Abstinence, as prescribed by the
                    gospel, is intended to -mortify and restrain the passions, to humble our vicious
                    natures, and by that means raise our minds to a due sense of devotion. But there
                    is another sort of abstinence, which may be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ritual,</hi> and consists in abstaining from particular meats at certain times
                    and seasons. It was the spiritual monarchy of the western world which first
                    introduced this ritual abstinence, the rules of which were called <hi
                    rend="italic">rogations</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but grossly abused from the
                    true nature and design of fasting. In England, abstinence from flesh has been
                    enjoined by statute since the Reformation, particularly on Fridays and
                    Saturdays, on vigils, and on all commonly called <hi rend="italic">fish
                    days.</hi> The like injunctions were renewed under Queen Elizabeth; but at the
                    same time it was declared that this was done, not out of motives of religion, as
                    if there were any difference in meats, but in favour of the consumption of fish,
                    and to multiply the number of fishermen and mariners, as well as to spare the
                    stock of sheep. The great fast, says St Augustin, is to abstain from sin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abstinence</hi> is more particularly used for a spare diet,
                    or a slender parsimonious use of food. Physicians relate wonders of the effects
                    of abstinence in the cure of many disorders, and protracting the term of life.
                    The noble Venetian Cornaro, after all imaginable means had proved vain, so that
                    his life was despaired of at 40, recovered, and lived to near 100, by the mere
                    effect of abstinence; as he himself gives the account. It is indeed surprising
                    to what a great age the primitive Christians of the East, who retired from the
                    persecutions into the deserts of Arabia and Egypt, lived, healthful and
                    cheerful, on a very little food. Cassian assures us, that the common rate for 24
                    hours was 12 ounces of bread, and pure water: with such frugal fare St Anthony
                    lived 105 years; James the Hermit, 104; Arsenius, tutor of the Emperor Arcadius,
                    120; St Epiphanius, 115; Simeon the Stylite, 112; and Romauld, 120. Indeed, we
                    can match these instances of longevity at home. Buchanan informs us, that one
                    Laurence arrived at the great age of 140 by force of temperance and labour; and
                    Spotswood mentions one Kentigern, afterwards called St Mongah or Mungo, who
                    lived to 185 by the same means. Abstinence, however, is to be recommended only
                    as it means a proper regimen; for in general it must have bad consequences when
                    observed without a due regard to constitution, age, strength, &amp;c. According
                    to Dr Cheyne, most of the chronical diseases, the infirmities of old age, and
                    the short lives of Englishmen, are owing to repletion, and may be either cured,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030407" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0407-0046"/> prevented, or
                    remedied by abstinence; but then the kinds of abstinence which ought to be
                    observed, either in sickness or health, are to be deduced from the laws of diet
                    and regimen.</p>
                <p>Among the inferior animals, we see extraordinary instances of long abstinence.
                    The serpent kind, in particular, bear abstinence to a wonderful degree. We have
                    seen rattle-snakes which had lived many months without any food, yet still
                    retained their vigour and fierceness. Dr Shaw speaks of a couple of cerastes (a
                    sort of Egyptian serpents), which had been kept five years in a bottle close
                    corked, without any sort of food, unless a small quantity of sand in which they
                    coiled themselves up in the bottom of the vessel may be reckoned as such; yet
                    when he saw them, they had newly cast their skins, and were as brisk and lively
                    as if just taken. But it is natural for divers species to pass four, five, or
                    six months every year, without either eating or drinking. Accordingly, the
                    tortoise, bear, dormouse, serpent, &amp;c. are observed regularly to retire, at
                    those seasons, to their respective cells, and hide themselves, some in the
                    caverns of rocks or ruins; others dig holes under ground; others get into woods,
                    and lay themselves up in the clefts of trees; others bury themselves under
                    water, &amp;c. And these animals are found as fat and fleshy, after some months’
                    abstinence, as before.—Sir G. Ent<note anchored="true" place="margin"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ρhil. Trans.</hi> No. 191.</p></note>
                    weighed his tortoise several years successive!y, at its going to earth in
                    October, and coming out again in March; and found, that of four pounds four
                    ounces, it only used to lose about one ounce.</p>
                <p>We have instances of men passing several months as strictly abstinent as other
                    creatures. In particular, the records of the Tower mention a Scotsman imprisoned
                    for felony, and strictly watched in that fortress for six weeks, during which
                    time he did not take the least sustenance; and on this account he obtained his
                    pardon. Numberless instances of extraordinary abstinence, particularly from
                    morbid causes, are to be found in the different periodical Memoirs,
                    Transactions, Ephemerides, &amp;c. It is to be added, that, in most instances of
                    extraordinary abstinence related by naturalists, there were said to have been
                    apparent marks of a texture of blood and humours, much dike that of the animals
                    above-mentioned. Though it is no improbable opinion that the air itself may
                    furnish something for nutrition, it is certain there are substances of all
                    kinds, animal, vegetable, &amp;c. floating in the atmosphere, which must be
                    continually taken in by respiration; and that an animal body may be nourished
                    thereby, is evident in the instance of vipers; which, if taken when first
                    brought forth, and kept from every thing but air, will yet grow very
                    considerably in a few days. So the eggs of lizards are observed to increase in
                    bulk after they are produced; and in like manner the eggs or spawn of fishes
                    grow and are nourished with the water. And hence, say some, it is that cooks,
                    turnspit dogs, &amp;c. though they eat but little, yet are usually fat.</p>
