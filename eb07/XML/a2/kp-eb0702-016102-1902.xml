                <p><label type="entry">ADORATION</label>, the act of rendering divine honours, or of
                    addressing a being, as supposing it a god. The word is compounded of <hi
                    rend="italic">ad,</hi> to, and <hi rend="italic">os, oris,</hi> mouth; and
                    literally signifies to apply the hand to the mouth; <hi rend="italic"
                    >manum</hi><hi rend="italic">ad os</hi><hi rend="italic">admovere,</hi> to kiss
                    the hand; this being in the eastern countries one of the great marks of respect
                    and submission.—The Romans practised adoration at sacrifices and other
                    solemnities; in passing by temples, altars, groves, &amp;c.; at the sight of
                    statues, images, or the like, whether of stone or wood, wherein any thing of
                    divinity was supposed to reside. Usually there were images of the gods placed at
                    the gates of cities, for those who went in or out to pay their respects to. The
                    ceremony of adoration among the ancient Romans was thus :—The devotee, having
                    his head <hi rend="italic">covered,</hi> applied his right hand to his lips, the
                    fore finger resting on his thumb, which was erect, and thus bowing his head,
                    turned himself round from left to right The kiss thus given was called <hi
                    rend="italic">osculum</hi><hi rend="italic">labratum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> for ordinarily they were afraid to touch the images of their gods
                    themselves with their profane lips. Sometimes, however, they would kiss their
                    feet, or even knees, it being held an incivility to touch their mouths; so that
                    the affair passed at some distance. Saturn, however, and Hercules were adored
                    with the head <hi rend="italic">bare;</hi> whence the worship of the last was
                    called <hi rend="italic">institutum peregrinum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ritus</hi><hi rend="italic">Graecanicus,</hi> as departing from the customary
                    Roman method, which was to sacrifice and adore with the face veiled, and the
                    clothes drawn up to the ears, to prevent any interruption in the ceremony by the
                    sight of unlucky objects.—The Jewish manner of adoration was by prostration,
                    bowing, and kneeling. The Christians adopted the Grecian rather than the Roman
                    method, and adored always <hi rend="italic">uncovered.</hi> The ordinary posture
                    of the ancient Christians was kneeling, but on Sundays standing; and they had a
                    peculiar regard to the east, to which point they ordinarily directed their
                    prayers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adoration</hi> is also used for certain extraordinary <hi
                    rend="italic">civil honours</hi> or respects which resemble those paid to the
                    Deity, yet are given to men.</p>
                <p>The Persian manner of adoration, introduced by Cyrus, was by bending the knee and
                    falling on the face at the prince’s feet, striking the earth with the forehead,
                    and kissing the ground. This ceremony, which the Greeks called <hi rend="italic"
                    >πgοσκυνειν,</hi> Conon refused to perform to Artaxerxes, and Calisthenes to
                    Alexander the Great, as reputing it impious and unlawful.</p>
                <p>The adoration performed to the Roman and Grecian emperors consisted in bowing or
                    kneeling at the prince’s feet, laying hold of his purple robe, and presently
                    withdrawing the hand and clapping it to the lips. Some attribute the origin of
                    this practice to Constantius. It was only persons of some rank or dignity that
                    were entitled to the honour. Bare kneeling before the emperor to deliver a
                    petition was also called <hi rend="italic">adoration.</hi></p>
                <p>The practice of adoration may be said to be still subsisting in England, in the
                    ceremony of kissing the king’s or queen’s hand, and in serving them at table,
                    both being performed kneeling.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adoration</hi> is also used among Roman writers for a high
                    species of <hi rend="italic">applause</hi> given to persons who had spoken or
                    performed well in public. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Acclamation.</hi> We meet
                    with adoration paid to orators, actors, musicians, &amp;c. The method of
                    expressing it was, by rising, putting both hands to their mouth, and then
                    returning them towards the person intended to be honoured.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adoration</hi> is also used in the court of Rome for the
                    ceremony of <hi rend="italic">kissing the pope’s feet.</hi> It is said of
                    Dioclesian, that he had gems fastened to his shoes, that divine honours might be
                    more willingly paid him, by kissing his feet. The like usage was afterwards
                    adopted by the popes, and is observed to this day. These prelates, finding a
                    vehement disposition in the people to fall down before them and kiss their feet,
                    procured crucifixes to be fastened on their slippers; by which stratagem the
                    adoration intended for the pope’s person is supposed to be transferred to
                    Christ.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adoration</hi> is also used for a method of <hi
                    rend="italic">electing a pope.</hi> The election of popes is performed two ways;
                    by <hi rend="italic">adoration</hi> and by <hi rend="italic">scrutiny.</hi> In
                    election by adoration, the cardinals rush hastily, as if agitated by some
                    spirit, to the adoration of some one among them, to proclaim him pope. When the
                    election is carried by scrutiny, they do not adore the new pope till he is
                    placed on the altar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Barbarous ADORATION</hi> is a term used, in the laws of King
                    Canute, for that performed after the manner of the heathens, who adored idols.
                    The Romish church is charged with the adoration of saints, martyrs, images,
                    crucifixes, relics, the virgin, and the host; all which by Protestants are
                    generally aggravated into idolatry, on a supposition that the honour thus paid
                    to them is absolute and supreme, called by way of distinction <hi rend="italic"
                    >Latria,</hi> which is due only to God. The Roman Catholics, on the contrary,
                    explain them as only a relative or subordinate worship, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dulia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hyperdulia,</hi> which terminates ultimately
                    in God alone. But may not the same be said of the idol worship of the heathens?
                    The Phoenicians adored the winds, on account of the terrible effects produced by
                    them: the same was adopted by most of the other nations, Persians, Greeks,
                    Romans, &amp;c. The Persians chiefly paid their adorations to the sun and fire;
                    some say also to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031915"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1915-0162"/>rivers, the wind, &amp;c. The motive of adoring
                    the sun was the benefits they received from that glorious luminary, which of all
                    creatures has doubtless the best pretensions to such homage.</p>
