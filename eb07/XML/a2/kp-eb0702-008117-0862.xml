                    Philosophy,</hi> denotes generally an increase of motion or velocity, and is
                    chiefly applied to the motion of such bodies as go on, not with a uniform
                    motion, but one which becomes continually quicker and quicker as they advance. A
                    body, for example, rolling down a hill proceeds slowly at first, but gradually
                    increases as it descends, until at last it acquires a velocity and momentum
                    which bears down every thingbefore it. The same thing takes place when a body is
                    dropped, and allowed to fall freely in the air; although the acceleration is
                    here less observable, on account of the great rapidity of the descent. The
                    earth, in its annual motion round the sun, is subject to a continued
                    acceleration from the apogee to the perigee, while from thence again it suffers
                    a similar retardation. Many other examples occur of such acceleration; but the
                    most interesting is the <hi rend="smallcaps">Acceleration of Falling
                    Bodies.</hi> That such an acceleration does take place, is obvious from many
                    circumstances, particularly the increasing momentum which a body acquires in
                    proportion to the height of its descent But it was only by considering the cause
                    of the descent that the true law of the acceleration was determined. This great
                    discovery we owe to the genius of Galileo. Various theories had been framed by
                    philosophers to account for the accelerated descent of falling bodies, but all
                    of them inconclusive and visionary. Some, for instance, ascribed it to the
                    weight of the pure air above increasing as the body descended. The followers of
                    Gassendi pretended that there are continually issuing out of the earth certain
                    attractive corpuscles directed in an infinite number of rays; those, say they,
                    ascend and then descend in such a manner, that the nearer a body approaches to
                    the earth’s centre, the more of these attractive rays press upon it, in
                    consequence of which its motion becomes accelerated. The Cartesians again
                    ascribed the effect to the reiterated impulses of their <hi rend="italic"
                    >materia</hi><hi rend="italic">subtilis</hi> acting continually on falling
                    bodies, and propelling them downwards. It appears now incredible how such dreams
                    could have been gravely proposed by men having the reputation of philosophers.
                    Galileo, however, on considering the subject attentively, and applying the
                    powerful aids of geometry and mathematics, soon discovered that the true cause
                    was simply the continued action of the moving force of gravity. This force,
                    Galileo reasoned, must operate continually on the body, not only at the moment
                    of starting, but also during every moment of its descent. And as the body
                    retains and accumulates all these impressions according to the great and
                    original law of moving bodies, no wonder that its motion should become
                    continually accelerated: for, suppose that gravity were to act only at certain
                    small intervals, each second for instance, and suppose that at first it
                    communicates such a motion to the body as causes it to descend, say ten feet in
                    the first second; the body could not stop here even though gravity were ceasing
                    altogether to act on it: retaining the original impression, it would still go on
                    moving uniformly at the rate of ten feet every second of its descent; but at the
                    end of the first second, gravity <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030875"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-0875-0082"/>again acts on it and communicates a second
                    impression, by virtue of which it would descend ten feet during the second
                    interval, in addition to the ten feet arising from the original impulse; so that
                    on the whole it descends 20 feet in the second interval. In the same manner,
                    during the third interval it would descend 30 feet, and during the fourth 40,
                    and so on; the space described in each second thus increasing regularly with the
                    increase of the time.</p>
                <p>Hence Galileo deduced the fundamental law of acceleration in falling bodies, that
                    the <hi rend="italic">Velocity,</hi> which in every case is just the space
                    described in each second or other fixed interval, <hi rend="italic">increases in
                    exact proportion to the whole time of descent;</hi> so that whatever be the
                    velocity at the end of the first second, then at the end of any number of
                    seconds the velocity would just be as many times greater,—a law from which he
                    easily deduced all the others regarding the descent of falling bodies, which are
                    of so much importance in mechanical inquiries. The most remarkable is that which
                    regards the <hi rend="italic">Space</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This phrase, we may remark, probably from Galileo’s
                    geometrical illustration, haá been rather awkwardly Introduced in tħese
                    discussions, and in a way which tends to produce a little obscurity. Space
                    generally includes the idea of extension, in at least two dimensions, both
                    length and breadth; whereas it is here employed to denote merely the lineal
                    extent, the length of the track deshibed by the moving body,</p></note>
                    described, or the total amount of the descent in a given time. This Galileo
                    deduced very elegantly from a simple geometrical consideration. In every case of
                    a body moving uniformly without acceleration, the space described in any given
                    time must be proportional to the time, and must be found by multiplying the time
                    by the velocity: it may be represented, therefore, by a simple diagram. Let A B,
                    for instance, denote by its length the velocity of the body, or the number of
                    feet described by it in a second, and CD the time or number of seconds during
                    which it is in motion; then, if we construct a rectangle <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> E, of which one of the sides, <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> is equal to A
                    B, and the other, <hi rend="italic">c d,</hi> equal to C D, this rectangle, that
                    is, the number of square feet in it, will denote the space, that is, the number
                    of lineal feet described during the· whole period. Let us now apply this
                    principle to the case of a body moving with an accelerated velocity, and let AB,
                    CD, EF, &amp;c. denote the velocities at the end of certain equal intervals of
                    time, of which let each be denoted by <hi rend="italic">l m</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and suppose also, that during each of these intervals the
                    motion is uniform, and is only accelerated by a sort of start which takes place
                    at the end of each: then, if we construct a rectangle <hi rend="italic">a l
                    b,</hi> of which <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> is equal to A B, the velocity at the
                    end of the first interval, and <hi rend="italic">α l</hi> equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">l m</hi> the first interval, this rectangle will denote the space
                    described during that interval. Continue now the line <hi rend="italic">a l</hi>
                    to <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> making <hi rend="italic">l m</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic">α I = I rn,</hi> and continue also <hi rend="italic">I
                    c</hi> to <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> so that <hi rend="italic">l d</hi> may be
                    equal to D C, the velocity during the second interval, and complete the
                    rectangle <hi rend="italic">dime,</hi> this will denote the space described in
                    the second interval; and, in the same manner, each of the succeeding rectangles
                    in descending will denote the space described in the succeeding interval, so
                    that the total amount of the descent will be denoted by the sum of all the
                    rectangles together, or by the compound figure which they form. But what is the
                    nature of this figure? It is evidently, as appears more clearly by taking out
                    the parallel lines, triangular, only that the longest side presents a serrated
                    outline. What is the cause of this? It is clearly owing to the supposition we
                    have made of the motion continuing uniform during the intervals, and then
                    increasing by starts; instead of growing continually, as it really does. Suppose
                    then that we shorten the intervals one-half, for instance, and double their
                    number, we shall then be much nearer the truth; but the inequalities in the
                    hypothenuse of the triangle are now greatly reduced; and the more we thus
                    diminish the intervals, and increase their number, the more nearly does it
                    approach to a straight line, In the extreme case, therefore, where there are in
                    reality no intervals, but where the velocity goes on continually increasing,
                    neither will there be any inequalities in the outline; the figure will be really
                    a triangle: and while the vertical side A B denotes the time of descent, and the
                    horizontal B C the velocity, the area of the triangle will denote in square
                    measure the space descended in the given time. But the areas of similar
                    triangles are in every case proportional to the squares of their corresponding
                    sides; that is, the area ABC is to A D E as the square of A B or B C is to the
                    square of A D or D E. Hence in general it follows, that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spaces</hi> described in any given time or times are always <hi rend="italic"
                    >proportional to the squares of these times,</hi> and also to the <hi
                    rend="italic">squares of the velocities at the end of such times.</hi> Thus, if
                    a body describes 16 feet during the first second of its descent, it will, during
                    the next, descend 4 times as much, or 64; during the third 9 times, or 144 feet;
                    during the fourth 16 times, or 256, and so on.</p>
                <p>Such, then, is the great law of acceleration in regard to the spaces described.
                    It is easily deducible also from numerical or algebraical considerations. Let
                    the velocity, for example, at the end of any given time, such as a second, be
                    denoted by 1; then in the second, third, and fourth, it will be 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.
                    But the space described at the end of any time is evidently equal to the time
                    multiplied by the mean velocity; that is, the velocity at the half-interval.
                    During the first second, therefore, the space described wifi be ⅛, during the
                    second f, during the third f, during the fourth ½, and so on; adding these
                    successively, the whole space from the beginning at the end of each interval
                    will be ½, ½, ∣, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> J <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi>, &amp;c., being each proportional to the square of the time.
                    Algebraically again, if we suppose gravity to act only at the end of successive
                    intervals, and the motion to continue uniform during these, then the spaces
                    described will form an arithmetical progression, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >α,</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> 3 <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> 4 α, 5 α, <hi
                    rend="italic">&amp;c. ... n a,</hi> and the wħble space will be the sum of this
                    series, or <hi rend="italic">α + η a</hi> χ . =</p>
                <p>2 <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030888" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0888-0083"/>n <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + n × -. Suppose now the intervals diminished 2</p>
                <p>in extent and increased in number indefinitely, they will bear no sort of
                    proportion to <hi rend="italic">n-</hi>: the second term of the above sum
                    therefore maybe neglected, and ultimately the whole space will be proportional
                    to n <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>, the square of the time. In every view,
                    then, this great, law is established; and when we come to try it experimentally,
                    which is done by means of Atwood’s machine, it is confirmed by the nicest
                    observation; every falling body describing in the first second 16⅛ feet, and in
                    every other a space proportional to the time. See <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Acceleration,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Astronomy,</hi> is
                    applied in various ways, and to different objects. Thus, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acceleration pf the Fixed Stars</hi> denotes that apparent increase of motion
                    or velocity by which night after night they arrive sooner and sooner upon the
                    meridian than before. A star which passes the meridian to-night at 10 o’clock,
                    for instance, will to-morrow night arrive at it 3' 56" sooner, or at 56' 4" past
                    nine, and so on each succeeding evening; thus anticipating continually the
                    motion of the sun, which regulates the length of the day. A star which passes
                    the meridian to-day with the sun, will to-morrow pass 3' 56" sooner; so that it
                    appears to revolve with a quicker or accelerated motion. It is in reality the
                    sun, however, moving continually backwards among the stars which causes in them
                    this apparent acceleration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acceleration of the Planets</hi> denotes that accelerated
                    motion with which they all, as well as the earth, advance from the perigee to
                    the apogee of their orbits. This acceleration is most readily observed by
                    comparing the successive diurnal motions of the planet in its orbit. When the
                    actual diurnal motion exceeds the mean diurnal motion, the planet is
                    accelerated; and, on the other hand, when it falls short of it, it is retarded,
                    as takes place between the apogee and perigee.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acceleration of the Moon</hi> is a remarkable increase which
                    has been discovered in the moon’s motion in her orbit, which has been going on
                    increasing from age to age by a gradation so imperceptible, that it was only
                    discovered or suspected by Dr Halley, on comparing the ancient eclipses observed
                    at Babylon and others with those of his own time. The quantity of this
                    acceleration was afterwards determined by Mr Dunthorne from more accurate data
                    regarding the longitudes of Alexandria and Babylon, and from the most authentic
                    eclipse of which any good account remains, observed at Babylon in the year 721
                    before Christ. The beginning of this eclipse, as observed at that time, was
                    about an hour and three quarters sooner than he found it would have been by
                    computation; and hence he found the mean acceleration, or what has since been
                    termed the moon’s secular equation, about 10" of a degree each century.
                    According to Laplace, it amounts to 11∙135". This remarkable fact had long
                    excited the attention of astronomers; as, along with several others of the same
                    kind among the heavenly bodies, it seemed to betray imperfection; exhibiting
                    inequalities which were continually increasing, instead of correcting themselves
                    or being somehow compensated by that admirable design which prevailed in every
                    other part of the system. At last, however, it was discovered, by the
                    application of a refined analysis, that these inequalities were not perpetual;
                    that they actually terminate in the lapse of ages, and again return in the
                    opposite direction, thus preserving entire the harmony of the celestial motions.
                    This fine discovery, which observation alone could never have disclosed, we owe
                    to the genius of Laplace. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy</hi> in this work;
