                    the most celebrated of the Arabian writers on history and geography. Among his
                    contemporaries he was also distinguished both as a ruler and a warrior. His
                    descent was in a direct line from Ayoub, father to Saladin, and from whom the
                    house of that conqueror received the appellation of Ayoubites. Omar, the
                    grandson of Ayoub, was one of Saladin’s most distinguished generals, and enjoyed
                    the privilege, which he transmitted to his posterity, of being placed always on
                    the right of the army. In reward of his services, he was created Prince of
                    Hamah, the ancient Apamea, which, with some territories adjoining, became
                    hereditary in his family. They were transmitted, in the course of succession, to
                    Mahommed Mahmoud, and to Mahommed, the uncle of Aboulfeda. Although none of
                    these princes equalled the military glory of Omar, they were yet distinguished
                    both in arms and letters. Continually engaged in military expeditions, their
                    court was at the same time open to learned men. It is mentioned, among the
                    proofs of their zeal for science, that Mahmoud caused to be constructed at
                    Hamah, a gilded sphere of great magnitude, on which all the stars then known
                    were represented.</p>
                <p>Aboulfeda was son to Ally, the brother of Mahommed. He was born at Damascus in
                    the year 672 of the Hegira, (1273 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D.) His early
                    years were spent in the study of the Koran and of the sciences. By the age of
                    twelve, however, he was summoned to the field, and was present at the attack of
                    Marcab, a castle belonging to the knights of St John. Syria was then shaken by
                    continual war, and thus scarcely a year elapsed, in which the young prince was
                    not called out upon some military expedition. He successively assisted at the
                    sieges of Tripoli, Acre, and Roum. In 1298, Prince Mahmoud, his cousin, who held
                    the sovereignty, died, and left Aboulfeda heir. The succession, however, being
                    violently disputed by his two brothers, the court, in consequeňce of their
                    dissensions, took occasion to supersede all the three; and the Ayoubites lost
                    the principality which they had enjoyed for more than a century. Aboulfeda,
                    however, by his valour and other eminent qualities, soon recommended himself to
                    the favour of the Sultan Melik-el-Nassir. He was present, and took an active
                    part in the victory gained at Alkoroum in 1302, and in the still more signal one
                    near Damascus in 1303, by which Syria was for the time delivered from the
                    incursions of the Tartars. But peace was soon followed by internal dissensions.
                    The throne of Egypt was disputed with Melik-el-Nassir by Bibars, who at first
                    succeeded in obtaining possession of it. His rival, however, being supported by
                    the great men of Syria, among whom Aboulfeda took a conspicuous part, finally
                    triumphed. Aboulfeda, who had always stood well with Melik-el-Nassir, rose then
                    into peculiar favour. The sultan took the first opportunity of establishing him
                    in his patrimonial dignity of Prince of Hamah. Honours continued to shower upon
                    him; he was invested with the distinctive marks of sovereignty, which consisted
                    in the power of coining money, and in having prayers said in his name. The
                    epithet <hi rend="italic">Melik Moway∙ yad,</hi> victorious Prince, was
                    conferred upon him; and it is stated by an Arabian author, that the sultan, in
                    writing, addressed him by the appellation of brother.</p>
                <p>The rest of Aboulfeda’s life was spent in splendour and tranquillity, devoted to
                    the government of his territory, and to the pursuits of science. Besides
                    cultivating, he patronised literature; and his court became the rendezvous of
                    all the learned men of the East. He conversed with them familiarly, bestowed
                    upon them honours and pensions, and being himself superior to all in learning,
                    felt no jealousy of their acquirements. During the same period he composed the
                    works which have transmitted his name to posterity. In this enviable manner he
                    spent the period of twenty years, when an illness, of which the particulars are
                    not related, carried him off on the 26th October 1331. He was succeeded by his
                    son Melik-el-Afdhal, of whom little is recorded, and who was the last Prince of
                    Hamah.</p>
                <p>The two works by which Aboulfeda is known in Europe, are his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geography</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">History.</hi> The former ranks at
                    least equal to any composed upon that subject by the Arabian writers. It
                    partakes indeed of their general defects; for, although he seems to have paid
                    more attention to the latitudes and longitudes than the rest of his countrymen,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030342" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0342-0041"/>yet the
                    imperfect application of astronomy, and the obscurity of his notation, have much
                    diminished the i value of this part of his labours. It is chiefly in the
                    historical and descriptive parts that he can now be regarded as an authority.
                    Here too his knowledge, as he himself candidly confesses, is chiefly confined to
                    the circle of Moslem dominion; but within those limits, the information conveyed
                    by him is undoubtedly valuable.</p>
                <p>His <hi rend="italic">History</hi> possesses still higher claims to distinction.
                    His method, as was usual with his countrymen, is entirely that of annals, and is
                    in many parts too much abridged; but the work contains much valuable information
                    with regard to the Saracen, and even to the Greek empire. It is divided into
                    five parts, beginning at the creation of the world, and ending with the year
                    1328.</p>
                <p>There are copies of his <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi> in manuscript in the
                    national library of France, in that of the university of Leyden, and in the
                    Bodleian. It has hitherto been published only in fragments, of which the

                    different circumstances prevented their execution.</p>
