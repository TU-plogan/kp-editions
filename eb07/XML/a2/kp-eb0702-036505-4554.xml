                    large province situated in the centre of Hindostan, between the 24th and 31st
                    degrees of N. lat. It is bounded on the north by the provinces of Moultan,
                    Lahore, and Delhi; on the south by Gujerat and Malwah; on the east by Delhi and
                    Agra, and on the west by Moultan and the principality of Sinde. From north to
                    south it extends 350 miles, and is 200 in average breadth. The following are the
                    modern divisions of this province :—</p>
                <p>1. The Bhatty country.</p>
                <p>2. Bicanere.</p>
                <p>3. The Great Sandy Desert</p>
                <p>4. Jesselmere.</p>
                <p>5. Joudpoor.</p>
                <p>6. Marwar.</p>
                <p>7. Nagore.</p>
                <p>8. Shekawutty.</p>
                <p>9. Jeypoor.</p>
                <p>10. Ajmeer district</p>
                <p>11. Harowty.</p>
                <p>12. Odeypoor.</p>
                <p>13. Mewar.</p>
                <p>14. Sarowy.</p>
                <p>This province is generally of a barren and sandy soil, in many parts a good deal
                    covered by thorny trees and thickets of the cactus. The province of Marwar has a
                    superior soil, and is in a better state of cultivation than the eastern
                    provinces of Jeypoor and Ajmeer, or the southwestern tract of Mewar, including
                    Odeypoor. This part of the country was laid waste to such a degree by the
                    ravages of the Pindarees, that it has yet scarcely recovered. The soil,
                    naturally arid, is in some of the southern provinces rendered productive by
                    streams which descend from the mountains. The Chumbul, Calysina, and Banass are
                    the most considerable streams; and where they afford supplies of moisture, the
                    country presents something like the appearance of verdure. The soil of the whole
                    province is remarkably saline, containing many salt springs and lakes, and
                    producing salt and saltpetre spontaneously. In other parts, in order to procure
                    a supply of water, deep wells are sunk, from which the country being partially
                    irrigated, yields wheat, barley, and other sorts of grain and pulse common in
                    India. In Marwar, where they derive their supplies of water from these deep
                    wells, Bishop Heber mentions that he saw cotton growing of the finest quality,
                    and oxen and sheep which bore evidence, by their size and fatness, of the
                    luxuriance of the pasture. Other parts, again, of the southern provinces are
                    strangely desolate, though the ruins with which they are covered, and the
                    numerous tombs, show that they have been inhabited at no distant period, and
                    that their present desolation has been the work of violence.</p>
                <p>Towards the east, and in the north, there is an extensive tract, which is a
                    continued desert of the most dismal appearance. Towards the south mountainous
                    tracts occur, and between Marwar and Mewar they rise to 2000 feet above the
                    level of the sea. The mountains of Aboo, towards the western boundary, rise, it
                    is supposed, to the height of 6000 feet. Except in the mountains, trees are
                    seldom seen; and the consequence is, that timber for building and other purposes
                    is extremely scarce, and proportionably dear. Such is the scarcity of wooden
                    furniture, that at dinner parties it is the practice among the British residents
                    for ladies and gentlemen to send their own chairs to the house where the
                    entertainment is to take place; and they have nothing better for their doors and
                    windows than pieces of matting. The Shekawultz country on the west is sandy,
                    badly watered and cultivated, scattered over with rocky hills, and sprinkled
                    with tufts of long grass and bushes. Yet it contains several large towns; and it
                    seems to lose its title to be included in the desert, when compared with the
                    tract which extends north-east as far as Bahawulpoor, a distance of 280 miles;
                    and even this tract is only for the last hundred miles absolutely destitute of
                    inhabitants, water, or vegetation. For 180 miles the country presents the
                    appearance of hills and valleys of loose and heavy sand from 20 to 100 feet in
                    height. These hills shift their positions; and the passage of the desert is
                    rendered dangerous in summer by clouds of moving sand. Among these sandy deserts
                    villages are occasionally met with, which consist merely of a few round huts of
                    straw, with low conical roofs like stooks of corn. They are surrounded by hedges
                    of dry thorny branches, stuck in the sand. Around these miserable abodes are to
                    be seen a few fields, which depend for water on the rains and dews, and which
                    bear thin crops of the poorest kinds of pulse, and a species of the <hi
                    rend="italic">holcus</hi><hi rend="italic">spi</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193034567" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4567-0366"/><hi rend="italic">catus,</hi>
                    which, though it flourishes in the most sterile countries, grows here with
                    difficulty, each stalk several feet from its neighbour. In this arid waste is
                    found in profusion the most juicy of all fruits, the water-melon. Some of these
                    grow to the size of three or four feet in circumference, from a stalk as slender
                    as that of the common melon. Agriculture depends on supplies of water procured
                    from wells thinly scattered over the country, and sunk to the enormous depth of
                    300 and 345 feet, while some of them are only three feet in diameter. The water
                    is drawn from these wells by water-wheels worked by bullocks, in small
                    quantities, and is brackish and unwholesome. The wells are lined with masonry,
                    and the natives frequently cover them with boards heaped with sand, which
                    effectually conceals them from an enemy. The rest of the desert for 100 miles,
                    from Poogul to Bahawulpoor, is a flat hard clay, which sounds under the horses’
                    hoofs like a board. In some places small sand-hills are formed over the clay, on
                    which a few plants shoot up. But the clay is destitute of all appearance of
                    vegetation; and, excepting at the fort and pool of Monjgur, and two wells about
                    sixteen miles from Bahawulpoor, the country is wholly destitute both of
                    inhabitants and of water. In approaching the town of Bahawulpoor the desert and
                    the cultivated country are separated as if by a marked line. The edge of the
                    desert is skirted by a long row of trees; and beyond it are to be seen clumps of
                    trees, green fields, and wells of abundant and clear water, with houses and
                    every sign of fertility and cultivation. This great desert is 400 miles in
                    breadth, and extends far beyond the limits of Ajmeer. Several tracts are within
                    the limits of the periodical rains, and might be recovered from desolation by
                    industry; but at present these rains are absorbed by the thirsty soil, without
                    any benefit whatever to the inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The domestic animals are bullocks and camels. The animals of the desert are, the
                    antelope; the wild ass, remarkable for its shyness and for its speed; the fox;
                    and a curious species of rat, which is found in such numbers that the ground is
                    undermined by it in many parts, and is rendered dangerous to horsemen. The lower
                    classes of the people are Jauts. They are of small stature, ill-looking, and
                    have every appearance of poverty and wretchedness. The upper classes are Rhatore
                    Rajpoots. They are a stout and handsome race, with hooked noses and Jewish
                    features; of haughty manners, indolent in their habits, and almost continually
                    drunk with opium. The inhabitants are estimated at 3,000,000, the Mahometans
                    being to the Hindoos as one to eight. The principal towns are Jeypoor, Joudpoor,
                    Odeypoor, Ajmeer, Kotah, Bondee, Rantampoor, Chitore, Shahpoorah, Bicanere, and
                    Jesselmere. The three grand modern divisions of Raj-pootana are, Isí, Odeypoor,
                    named also Mewar and the Rana of Chitore; 2<hi rend="italic">d,</hi> Joudpoor,
                    named also Marwar, and its sovereign occasionally described as the Rhatore
                    Rajah, being of that tribe; 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>, Jeypoor, Jynagur, or
                    Ambeer, three names of one state. From the dismemberment of these, the original
                    Rajpoot states, others have been formed, and in later times the rajahs of
                    Jesselmere and Bicanere, and the petty chiefs of Kotah, Boondee, and
                    Banswara.</p>
                <p>The country is governed by numerous chiefs, who owe allegiance and pay tribute to
                    their liege lords; and who occasionally, as opportunities occur, have thrown off
                    their dependence, and have set up as independent sovereigns within their own
                    territories. During the scenes of confusion and trouble which took place in
                    Central India, previously to the last war, and general pacification in 1818,
                    Rajpootana was frequently laid waste by the inroads of the Pindarees and other
                    freebooters, who were in many cases abetted by the native chiefs. At that time
                    no title was secure; power was the only rule of right; and various portions of
                    the province were possessed and held by powerful invaders, such as Scindia and
                    Holkar. Such was the anarchy that prevailed in this province, as well as
                    generally in Central India, that every freebooter who could collect a sufficient
                    force extorted contributions from the peaceable inhabitants. The petty chiefs
                    were also frequently involved in war with each other; and the destruction
                    inseparable from such contests added to the mass of misery which already pressed
                    on the country. When the war undertaken by the British in 1817, against the
                    bands of plunderers who infested the country, and spread confusion and misery
                    wherever they appeared, was brought to a successful termination, Ajmeer was
                    finally rescued from the Mahratta influence, and placed under Sir D. Ochterlony,
                    as resident and commander; and a large body of troops was cantoned near the city
                    of Ajmeer, by whose presence the turbulent were overawed, and the public peace
                    preserved. Since this period tranquillity and good order have arisen out of
                    confusion; and the peaceable inhabitants, delivered from rapine, and from the
                    miseries of continued pillage and oppression, have resumed their former
                    occupations of commerce and agriculture. The different chiefs are allowed to
                    regulate their own internal policy; but they are no longer permitted to go to
                    war with each other, all their differences being now referred to the supreme
                    tribunal of British authority. (p.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ajmeer,</hi> a city of Hindostan, in the province of Ajmeer.
                    It is situated on the slope of a hill, and was nearly ruined in the long period
                    of anarchy and misgovernment which prevailed in Central India prior to 1819. It
                    was acquired by the British from Scindia in 1818, when it was in a state of the
                    utmost desolation and decay. After this period it rapidly improved; and in 1823
                    commerce had revived, and the population had been more than tripled. Bishop
                    Fieber, who visited it in 1825, mentions, that it is a well-built town, of
                    moderate size. The buildings are chiefly white-washed; and the surrounding rocks
                    have some thorny trees and brush-wood on them, which hide their barrenness, and
                    make a good back-ground to the little ruinous mosques and Mussulman tombs which
                    are scattered round the circuit of this holy city. Above, on the mountain top,
                    is a very remarkable fortress, called Taraghur, nearly two miles in circuit,
                    but, from its irregular shape and surface, not capable of containing more than
                    1200 men. It consists of a plain stone-wall along the edge of a mountain,
                    strengthened with a few round bastions; and it has an abundant supply of good
                    water in all seasons, from cisterns cut in the rock. The works of this fortress
                    are now going fast to decay, as it is not the policy of the British government
                    to rely, for their security, on fortresses. The old palace and garden of Shah
                    Jehan still exist, and the former contains several habitable rooms. Ajmeer is
                    renowned as a place of pilgrimage, the great attraction being the tomb of Khoja
                    Mögen ud Deen, famed as a great Mahometan saint, whose miracles are celebrated
                    all over India. The tomb is of white marble, but remarkable neither for style
                    nor beauty of architecture. To this place the emperor Acbar made a pilgrimage on
                    foot, to implore at the sainted tomb the blessing of male offspring. The
                    emperors of Delhi formed a fine fresh-water lake just above the city, which
                    during the rains is six miles in circumference. It supplies the means of
                    irrigation to a large district on its banks, is full of fish, and affords
                    excellent water to the inhabitants of the town. Ajmeer is 80 miles W. S. W. from
                    Jeypoor. Travelling distance from Delhi 230 miles; from Bombay, 650; and from
                    Calcutta, 1030 miles. Long. 74. 28. E. Lat. 26.31. N. (Bishop Heber’s <hi
