                <p><label type="entry">AESCHYLUS</label>, the tragic poet, was born at Athens. The
                    time of his birth is not exactly ascertained. Some suppose that it was in the
                    65th, others in the 70th Olympiad; but according to Stanley, who follows the
                    Arundelian<pb break="no" facs="nls:193032370" xml:id="kp-eb0702-2370-0197"/>
                    marbles, he was born in the 63d Olympiad. He was the son of Euphorion, and
                    brother to Cynaegirus and Amynias, who distinguished themselves in the battle of
                    Marathon and the sea-fight of Salamis, at which engagements Aeschylus was
                    likewise present. In this last action, according to Diodorus Siculus, Amynias,
                    the youngest of the three brothers, commanded a squadron of ships, and fought
                    with so much conduct and bravery, that he sunk the admiral of the Persian fleet,
                    and signalized himself above all the Athenians. To this brother our poet was,
                    upon a particular occasion, obliged for saving his life. Aelian relates, that
                    Aeschylus, being charged by the Athenians with certain blasphemous expressions
                    in some of his pieces, was accused of impiety, and condemned to be stoned to
                    death: they were just going to put the sentence in execution, when Amynias, with
                    a happy presence of mind, throwing aside his cloak, showed his arm without a
                    hand, which he had lost at the battle of Salamis in defence of his country. This
                    sight made such an impression on the judges, that, touched with the remembrance
                    of his valour, and with the friendship he showed for his brother, they pardoned
                    Aeschylus. Our poet, however, resented the indignity of this prosecution, and
                    resolved to leave a place where his life had been in danger. He became more
                    determined in this resolution when he found his pieces less pleasing to the
                    Athenians than those of Sophocles, though a much younger writer. Some affirm,
                    that Aeschylus never sat down to compose but when he had drunk liberally. He
                    wrote a great number of tragedies, of which there are but seven remaining; and
                    notwithstanding the sharp censures of some critics, he must be allowed to have
                    been the father of the tragic art. In the time of Thespis there was no public
                    stage to act upon, the strollers driving about from place to place in a cart.
                    Aeschylus furnished his actors with masks, and dressed them suitably to their
                    characters. He likewise introduced the buskin, to make them appear more like
                    heroes. The ancients gave Aeschylus also the praise of having been the first who
                    removed murders and shocking sights from the eyes of the spectators. He is said
                    likewise to have lessened the number of the chorus. M. Le Fevre has observed,
                    that Aeschylus never represented women in love in his tragedies, which, he says,
                    was not suited to his genius; but in representing a woman transported with fury
                    he was incomparable. Longinus says, that Aeschylus has a noble boldness of
                    expression, and that his imagination is lofty and heroic. It must be owned,
                    however, that he affected pompous words, and that his sense is too often
                    obscured by figures. This gave Salmasius occasion to say that he was more
                    difficult to be understood than the Scripture itself. But notwithstanding these
                    imperfections, this poet was held in great veneration by the Athenians, who made
                    a public decree that his tragedies should be played after his death. He was
                    killed in the 69th year of his age, by an eagle letting fall a tortoise upon his
                    head as he was walking in the fields. He had the honour of a pompous funeral
                    from the Sicilians, who buried him near the river Gela; and the tragedians of
                    the country performed plays and theatrical exercises at his tomb. The best
                    editions of Aeschylus are those of Stanley, folio, Lond. 1663, with an excellent
                    Latin translation and commentary; and of Schütz, in 3 vols. 8vo, Halle,
                    1782.</p>
