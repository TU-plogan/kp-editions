                    are telescopes contrived to remedy the aberrations in colours. The invention of
                    the telescope, by which the powers of vision are extended to the utmost
                    boundaries of space, forms an epoch in the history of science. The human
                    intellect had at last emerged from the long night of error, and begun to shine
                    with unclouded lustre. The age of erudition, which arose on the revival of
                    letters, had been succeeded by the age of science and philosophy. The study of
                    the ancient classics had infused some portion of taste and vigour. But men did
                    not long remain passive admirers; they began to feel their native strength, and
                    hastened to exert it. A new impulsion was given to the whole frame of society;
                    the bolder spirits, bursting from the trammels of authority, ventured to
                    question inveterate opinions, and to explore, with a fearless yet discerning
                    eye, the wide fields of human knowledge. Copernicus had partly restored the true
                    system of the world; Stevinus had extended the principles of mechanics; the fine
                    genius of Galileo had detected and applied the laws of motion; the bold
                    excursive imagination of Kepler had, by the aid of immense labour, nearly
                    completed his discovery of the great laws which control the revolutions of the
                    heavenly bodies; and our countryman Napier had just rendered himself immortal by
                    the sublime discovery of logarithms. At this eventful period, amidst the
                    fermentation of talents, the refracting telescope was produced by an obscure
                    glassgrinder in Holland,—a country then fresh from the struggle against foreign
                    oppression, and become the busy seat of commerce and of the useful arts. Yet the
                    very name of that meritorious person, and the details connected with his
                    invention, are involved in much obscurity. On a question of such peculiar
                    interest we shall afterwards endeavour to throw some light, by comparing
                    together such incidental notices as have been transmitted by contemporary
                    writers. In the mean time, we may rest assured that the construction of the
                    telescope was not, as certain authors would insinuate, the mere offspring of
                    chance, but was, like other scientific discoveries, the fruit of close and
                    patient observation of facts, directed with skill, and incited by an ardent
                    curiosity. A new and perhaps incidental <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031083"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1083-0098"/>appearance, which would pass unheeded by the
                    ordinary spectator, arrests the glance of genius, and sets all the powers of
                    fancy to work. But the inventor of the telescope, we are informed, was
                    acquainted besides with the elements of geometry, which enabled him to prosecute
                    his views, and to combine the results with unerring success. No sooner was this
                    fine discovery—admirable for the very simplicity of its principle—whispered
                    abroad, than it fixed the attention of the chief mathematicians over Europe.
                    Kepler, with his usual fertility'of mind, produced a treatise on <hi
                    rend="italic">Dioptrics,</hi> in which he investigated at large the distinct
                    effects of the combinations of different lenses.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Kepler explained the construction of the
                    astronomical telescope with two convex lenses; he likewise proposed a third
                    glass to restore the inverted image. But Scheiner first employed the
                    astronomical telescope, and described his observations with it in 1630. Father
                    Rheita placed the third lens of Kepler near the primary focus, and thus enlarged
                    the field of view. Such is the arrangement in the common spy-glass, which he
                    gave in 1665.</p></note> Galileo, from some very obscure hints, not only divined
                    the composition of the telescope, but actually constructed one, with a concave
                    eye-glass, which still bears his name. This telescope is shorter, but gives less
                    light than another one proposed by Kepler, and called the astronomical
                    telescope, which inverts the objects, and consists likewise of only two lenses,
                    that next the eye being convex. With such an imperfect instrument—the same,
                    indeed, though of rather higher magnifying power, with our modern
                    opera-glass—did the Tuscan artist, as our great poet quaintly styles the
                    philosopher, venture to explore the heavens.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    successive phases of the planet Venus, and discovered the more conspicuous of
                    Jupiter’s satellites. The truths thus revealed shook the inveterate prejudices
                    of the learned, and furnished the most triumphant evidence to the true theory of
                    the universe.</p>
                <p>It is painful to remark, that the application of the first telescope in the
                    country which had given it birth was directed to a very different purpose. The
                    maker, after having finished one, judging it of singular use in the military
                    profession, was naturally induced, by the hope of patronage, to present it to
                    the younger Prince Maurice, whose bravery and conduct had so beneficially
                    contributed to the independence of the United Provinces. But at this moment a
                    bloody tragedy was acting in Holland. The chief of the republic, not content
                    with that high station which the gratitude of his fellow-citizens had conferred
                    upon him, sought to aggrandize his power by crushing all opposition. In the
                    prosecution of his ambitions designs, he artfully gained the favour of the
                    undiscerning populace, and joining his intrigues to the violence of the
                    Calvinistic clergy, he succeeded in preferring the charge of a plot against the
                    more strenuous supporters of the commonwealth, which involved them in ruin. Not
                    only was the celebrated Grotius condemned to the gloom of perpetual
                    imprisonment, but the aged senator Bameveldt, whose wise and upright counsels
                    had guided the state amidst all the troubles of a long revolutionary conflict,
                    was led to the scaffold, on the 14th of May 1619, while his persecutor, ashamed
                    to approach the spectacle of his sufferings, beheld at a distance, with the
                    coolness of a tyrant, from the windows of his palace, and <hi rend="italic">by

                    all the melancholy circumstances attending the decollation.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The discovery of the telescope, from the
                    mystery at first practised, is involved in considerable uncertainty. The most
                    probable statement, however, ascribes the invention so early as 1590 to Zachary
                    Jansen, an intelligent spectacle-maker at Middleburg. This intelligent person,
                    led by accident to exercise his ingenuity on the subject, appears to have in
                    private matured the execution of that wonderful though simple instrument. In a
                    short time, however, the secret had transpired; and Laprey or Lippersheim, a
                    townsman of the same profession, produced telescopes for sale between the years
                    1600 and 1610. But, in 1608, Jansen likewise constructed the compound
                    microscope; and both instruments, by the activity of trade, were now spread
                    quickly over Europe. The telescope was copied, and perhaps improved, by Adrian
                    Metius, son of the celebrated mathematician. It was publicly sold at Frankfort
                    in 1608, and in the following year the instruments were brought by Drebbel for
                    sale to London.</p></note></p>
                <p>The skill and ingenuity of artists and mathematicians were now exerted in
                    attempts to improve the construction of an instrument so fortunately contrived.
                    The perfection of the telescope would require the union, as far as they are
                    capable of being conjoined, of three differ ent qualities,— distinctness of
                    vision, depth of magnifying power, and extent of field. Of these requisites, the
                    first two are evidently the most important, and to attain them was an object of
                    persevering research. For the condition of amplitude and clearness, it was
                    necessary that the principal image, or the one formed by the eye-glass, should
                    be large, bright, and well defined. On the supposition then generally received,
                    that, in the passage of light through the same media, the angle of incidence
                    bears a constant, ratio to the angle of refraction, which is very nearly true in
                    the case of small angles, it followed, as a geometrical consequence, that the
                    spherical figure would accurately collect all the rays into a focus. To obtain
                    the desired improvement of the telescope, therefore, nothing seemed to be
                    wanting but to enlarge sufficiently its aperture, or to employ for the eye-glass
                    a more considerable segment of the sphere. On trial, however, the results
                    appeared to be at variance with the hasty deductions of theory, and every
                    sensible enlargement of aperture was found to occasion a corresponding glare and
                    indistinctness of vision. But a discovery made soon afterwards in optics led to
                    more accurate conclusions. Willebrord Snell, a very ingenious Dutch
                    mathematician, who was snatched away at an early age, traced out by experiment,
                    about the year 1629, the true law that connects the angles of incidence and of
                    refraction; which the famous Descartes, who had about this time chosen Holland
                    for his place of residence, published, in 1637, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dioptrics,</hi> under its simplest form, establishing, that the sines of those
                    angles, and not the angles themselves, bore a constant ratio in the transit of
                    light between the same diaphanous media. It hence followed, that the lateral
                    rays of the light which enter a denser medium, bounded by a spherical surface,
                    in the direction of the axis, will not meet this axis precisely in the same
                    point, but will cross it somewhat nearer the surface. In short, the constant
                    ratio or index of refraction will be that of the distances of the actual focus
                    from the centre of the sphere, and from the point of external impact. Since an
                    arc differs from its sine by a quantity nearly proportioned to its cube, the
                    deviation of the extreme rays from the correct focus, or what is called the
                    spherical aberration, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031096"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1096-0099"/>must likewise proceed in that ratio, and
                    consequently will increase with extreme rapidity, as the aperture of the
                    telescope is enlarged. It was now attempted to modify the figure of the
                    object-glass, and to give it those curved surfaces which an intricate
                    geometrical investigation marks out as fitted to procure a perfect concentration
                    of all the refracted rays. Various contrivances were accordingly proposed for
                    assisting the artist in working the lenses into a parabolic or spheroidal shape,
                    and thus obtaining the exact surfaces generated by the revolution of the
                    different conic sections. All those expedients and directions, however, were
                    found utterly to fail in practice, and nature seemed, in this instance, to
                    oppose insurmountable barriers to human curiosity and research. Philosophers
                    began to despair of effecting any capital improvement in dioptrical instruments,
                    and turned their views to the construction of those depending on the principles
                    of catoptrics, or formed by certain combinations o,f reflecting specula. In
                    1663, the famous James Gregory, who in many respects may be regarded as the
                    precursor, and in some things even the rival of Newton, published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Optica</hi><hi rend="italic">Promota</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    a work distinguished by its originality, and containing much ingenious research
                    and fine speculation. In this treatise, a complete description is given of the
                    reflecting telescope now almost universally adopted, consisting of a large
                    perforated concave reflector combined with another very small and deep speculum
                    placed before the principal focus. But such was still the low state of the
                    mechanical arts in England, that no person was found capable of casting and
                    polishing the metallic specula with any tolerable delicacy, and the great
                    inventor never enjoyed the satisfaction and transport of witnessing the magic of
                    his admirable contrivance. It was after the lapse of more than half a century,
                    that Hadley—to whom we likewise owe another instrument scarcely less valuable,
                    the quadrant, or sextant, known by his name—at last succeeded in executing the
                    reflecting telescope. In the first attempt, silvered mirrors had been
                    substituted for the specula; nor did the reflectors come to obtain much
                    estimation, till, about the year 1733, the ingenious Mr Short distinguished
                    himself by constructing them in a style of very superior excellence.</p>
                <p>But though thus late in guiding the efforts of artists, the optical treatise of
                    Gregory proved the harbinger of that bright day which soon arose to illumine the
                    recesses of physical science. The capacious mind of Newton, nursed in the calm
                    of retirement and seclusion, was then teeming with philosophical projects. In
                    1665, when the tremendous visitation of the plague raged in London, and
                    threatened Cambridge and other places communicating with the capital, this
                    sublime genius withdrew from the routine of the university to his rural farm
                    near Grantham, and devoted himself to most profound meditation. Amidst his
                    speculations in abstruse mathematics and theoretical astronomy, Newton was
                    induced to examine the opinions entertained by the learned on the subject of
                    light and colours. With this view he had recently procured from the Continent
                    some prisms of glass, to exhibit the phenomena of refraction. Having placed the
                    axis of the prism or glass wedge at right angles to a pencil of light from the
                    sun, admitted through a small hole of the window-shutter in a darkened room, he
                    contemplated the glowing image or spectrum now formed on the opposite wall or
                    screen. This illuminated space was not round, however, as the young philosopher
                    had been taught to expect, but appeared very much elongated, stretching out five
                    times more than its breadth, and marked by a series of pure and brilliant
                    colours. It was therefore obvious that the colours were not confined to the
                    margin of the spectrum, nor could proceed from any varied intermixture of light
                    and shade; and the conclusion seemed hence irresistible, that the white pencil,
                    or solar beam, is really a collection of distinct rays, essentially coloured and
                    differently refracted; that the ray, for instance, which gives us the sensation
                    of the violet, is always more bent aside from its course by refraction than the
                    ray which we term green,—and that this green ray again is more refracted than
                    the red. When the spectrum was divided, by interposing partially a small screen,
                    and each separate parcel of rays made to pass through a second prism, they,
                    still retained their peculiar colour and refractive property, but now emerged in
                    parallel, and not in diverging lines as at first. The sun’s light is thus
                    decomposed by the action of the prism into a set of primary coloured rays; and
                    these rays, if they be afterwards recombined in the same proportions, will
                    always form a white pencil. It was hence easy to discern the real cause of the
                    imperfection of dioptrical instruments, which is comparatively little influenced
                    by the figure of the object-glass or spherical aberration, but proceeds mainly
                    from the unequal refraction of light itself. The focal distance of the red ray
                    being, in the most favourable case, about one fortieth part shorter than that of
                    the violet ray, the principal image is necessarily affected with mistiness, and
                    its margin always encircled by a coloured ring; for each point of the remote
                    object from which the light arrives is not represented by a corresponding point
                    in the image, but by a small circle composed of graduating colours, the centre
                    being violet and the circumference red. This radical defect seemed at that time
                    to be altogether irremediable. Newton had recourse, therefore, to the aid of
                    catoptrics, and contrived his very simple though rather incommodious reflecting
                    telescope, consisting of a concave speculum, with a small plane one placed
                    obliquely before it, to throw the image towards the side of the tube. This
                    instrument he actually constructed; and with all its rudeness, it promised
                    essential advantages to astronomy. The Newtonian reflector, after having been
                    long neglected, was lately revived by Dr Herschel; and from its great simplicity
                    and moderate dissipation of light, it is perhaps on the whole not ill calculated
                    for celestial observations.</p>
                <p>These unexpected and very important discoveries, which entirely changed the face
                    of optics, were soon communicated to the Royal Society, and published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1672. They were not received
                    however by the learned with that admiration to which they were justly entitled,
                    but gave occasion to so much ignorant opposition and obstinate controversy, that
                    the illustrious author, thoroughly disgusted at such unmerited reception,
                    henceforth, pursuing his experimental researches in silence, made no disclosure
                    of them to the world till more than thirty years afterwards, when his fame being
                    mature, and his authority commanding respect, he suffered his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise on Optics</hi> to appear abroad. This celebrated production has long
                    been regarded as a model of pure inductive science. The experiments which it
                    relates appear ingeniously · devised; the conclusions from them are drawn with
                    acuteness, and pursued with exquisite skill; and the whole discourse proceeds in
                    a style of measured and elegant simplicity. Though the researches were conducted
                    by a process of strict analysis, the composition of the work itself is cast into
                    the synthetical or didactic form, after the manner followed in the elementary
                    treatises of the ancient mathematicians. But with all its beauty and undisputed
                    excellence, it must be confessed that the treatise of optics is not exempt from
                    faults, and even material errors. We should betray the interests of science, if
                    we ever yielded implicit confidence even to the highest master. It is the glory
                    of Newton to have led the way in sublime discovery, and to have impressed <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193031109" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1109-0100"/> whatever he
                    touched with the stamp of profound and original genius. The philosopher paid the
                    debt of human infirmity, by imbibing some tincture of the mystical spirit of the
                    age, and taking a slight bias from the character of his studies. The difficult
                    art of experimenting was still in its infancy, and inquirers had not attained
                    that delicacy and circumspection which, in practice, are indispensable for
                    obtaining accurate results. Most of the speculations in the second and third
                    books of Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Optics,</hi> as we shall afterwards have
                    occasion to observe, are built on mistaken or imperfect views of some facts,
                    which the admixture of extraneous circumstances had accidentally disguised. The
                    very ingenious, but hasty, and often untenable hypotheses, which are subjoined,
                    under the modest and seemingly hesitating title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Queries,</hi> have, on the whole, been productive of real harm to the cause of
                    science, by the splendid example thus held forth to tempt the rashness of loose
                    experimenters, and of superficial reasoners. Even in the first book of <hi
                    rend="italic">Optics,</hi> some of the capital propositions are affected by
                    hasty and imperfect statements. The term <hi rend="italic">refrangibility,</hi>
                    applied to the rays of light, is at least unguarded; it conveys an indistinct
                    conception, and leads to inaccurate conclusions. The different refractions which
                    the primary rays undergo are not absolute properties inherent in these rays
                    themselves, but depend on the mutual relation subsisting between them and the
                    particular diaphanous medium. When the medium is changed, the refraction of one
                    set of rays cannot be safely inferred from that of another. Nay, in the passage
                    among certain media, those rays which are designated as the most refrangible
                    will sometimes be the least refracted. To ascertain correctly, therefore, the
                    index of refraction, it becomes necessary, in each distinct case, to examine the
                    bearing or disposition of the particular species of rays; since the principle,
                    that the refraction of the extreme rays is always proportioned to that of the
                    mean rays, involves a very false conclusion.</p>
                <p>When Newton attempted to reckon up the rays of light decomposed by the prism, and
                    ventured to assign the famous number <hi rend="italic">seven,</hi> he was
                    apparently influenced by some lurking disposition towards mysticism. If any
                    unprejudiced person will fairly repeat the experiment, he must soon be
                    convinced, that the various coloured spaces which paint the spectrum slide into
                    each other by indefinite shadings; he may name four or five principal colours,
                    but the subordinate divisions are evidently so multiplied as to be incapable of
                    enumeration. The same illustrious mathematician, we can hardly doubt,’ was
                    betrayed by a passion for analogy, when he imagined, that the primary colours
                    are distributed over the spectrum after the proportions of the diatonic scale of
                    music, since those intermediate spaces have really no precise and defined
                    limits. Had prisms of a different kind of glass been used, the distribution of
                    the coloured spaces would have been materially changed. The fact is, that all
                    Newton’s prisms being manufactured abroad, consisted of plate or crown glass,
                    formed by the combination of soda, or the mineral alkali, with silicious sand.
                    The refined art of glass-making had only been lately introduced into England,
                    and that beautiful variety called crystal, or flint-glass, which has so long
                    distinguished this country, being produced by the union of a silicious material
                    with the oxyde of lead, was then scarcely known. The original experimenter had
                    not the advantage, therefore, of witnessing the varied effects occasioned by
                    different prisms, which demonstrate, that the power of refraction is not less a
                    property of the peculiar medium than of the species of light itself. He
                    mentions, indeed, prisms formed with water confined by plates of glass; but the
                    few trials which he made with them had evidently been performed with no
                    sufficient attention. In spite of his habitual circumspection, he could not
                    always restrain the propensity so natural to genius, that of hastening to the
                    result, and of trusting to' general principles more than to any particular
                    details. But the same indulgent apology will not be conceded to some later
                    authors. It is truly astonishing that systematic writers on optics, in obvious
                    contradiction to the most undoubted discoveries related by themselves, should
                    yet repeat with complacency the fanciful idea of the harmonical composition of
                    light.</p>
                <p>Admitting the general conclusion which Newton conceived himself entitled to draw
                    from analogy and concurring experiment, that “the sine of incidence of every ray
                    considered apart, is to the sine of refraction in a given ratio it was strictly
                    demonstrable, that no contrary refractions whatever, unless they absolutely
                    restored the pencil to its first direction, could collect again the extreme
                    rays, and produce, by their union, a white light. Thus, let the ratios of the
                    sines of the angles of incidence and refraction of the violet rays in their
                    transit from air to other two denser mediums, be expressed by 1: <hi
                    rend="italic">M</hi> and 1: w; and the like ratios of the red rays under the
                    same circumstances, by 1: <hi rend="italic">N</hi> and 1: <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi>; where <hi rend="italic">M</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">N n</hi> respectively denote the refracting indices of those
                    extreme rays. It is manifest that the refracting indices, corresponding to the
                    passage of the violet and red rays from the first to the second medium, will be
                    represented by <hi rend="italic">M-N,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rn-n.</hi> But
                    by hypothesis, <hi rend="italic">M</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi><hi rend="italic">::</hi><hi rend="italic">N</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi><hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and consequently <hi rend="italic">M∙.
                    m</hi><hi rend="italic">:;</hi><hi rend="italic">M-N</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi><hi rend="italic">m-n</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that the extreme
                    rays would not be still separated and dispersed in proportion to the mean extent
                    of the final refraction. The great philosopher appears to have contemplated with
                    regret the result of his optical principle; and he had the penetration to
                    remark, that if a different law had obtained, the proper combination of distinct
                    refracting media would have corrected the spherical aberration. With this view,
                    he would propose for the object-glass of a telescope, a compound lens,
                    consisting of two exterior meniscuses of glass, their outsides being equally
                    convex, and their insides of similar but greater concavity, and having the
                    interior space filled with pure water, as in the figure annexed. He gives a
                    rule, though without demonstration, and evidently disfigured or imperfect, for
                    determining the curvature of the two surfaces: “And by this means,” he subjoins,
                    “might telescopes be brought to sufficient perfection, were it not for the
                    different refrangibility of several sorts of rays. But, by reason of this
                    different refrangibility, I do not see any other means of improving telescopes
                    by refractions alone, than that of increasing their lengths.”</p>
                <p>These remarks appeared to preclude all attempts to improve the construction of
                    the refracting telescope. Brightness and range of sight were sacrificed to
                    distinctness. Instead of enlarging the aperture, recourse was had to the
                    expedient of increasing the length of the focus. For nice astronomical
                    observations, telescopes were sought of the highest magnifying powers, and their
                    tubes had by degrees been extended to a most enormous and inconvenient size. But
                    the famous Dutch mathematician Huygens contrived to supersede the use of these
                    in certain cases, by a method which required, however, some address. Many years
                    afterwards the reflecting, or rather catadioptric telescope, of the Gregorian
                    construction, was executed with tolerable perfection. But a long period of
                    languor succeeded the brilliant age of discovery. Not a single advance was made
                    in the science of light and colours, till thirty years after the death of <pb

                    astronomy than to optics, and is indeed merely the result, however important, of
                    the progressive motion of light, detected near sixty years before by the Danish
                    philosopher Roemer, combined with the revolution of the earth in her

                    matters of science, implicit confidence even to the highest authority, but
                    shows, amidst all the apparent bustle of research, how very few original
                    experiments are made, and how seldom these are repeated with the due care and
                    attention.</p>
                <p>The impossibility of correcting the colours in objectglasses of telescopes was
                    therefore a principle generally adopted; though some vague hopes, grounded
                    chiefly on the consideration of final causes, were still at times entertained of
                    removing that defect. As the eye consists of two distinct humours, with a horny
                    lens or cornea interposed, it was naturally imagined that such a perfect
                    structure should be imitated in the composition of glasses. This inviting idea
                    is concisely mentioned by David Gregory, the nephew of James, in his little
                    tract on <hi rend="italic">Dioptrics.</hi> It has also been stated that a
                    country gentleman, Mr Hall of Chesterhall, in Worcestershire, discovered, about
                    the year 1729, the proper composition of lenses by the united segments of crown
                    and flint-glass, and caused a London artist, in 1733, to make a telescope under
                    his directions, which was found on trial to answer extremely well. But whatever
                    might be the fact, no notice was taken of it at the time, nor indeed till very
                    long after, when circumstances had occurred to call forth public attention.</p>
                <p>The Newtonian principle was first openly rejected, and a discussion excited,
                    which eventually led to a most valuable discovery in optics, by a foreign
                    mathematician of great celebrity and transcendent talents. Leonard Euler was one
                    of those rare mortals who arise, at distant intervals, to shed unfading lustre
                    on our species. Endowed with a penetrating genius and profound capacity, he was
                    capable of pursuing his abstruse investigations with unremitting ardour and
                    unwearied perseverance. To him the modern analysis stands chiefly indebted for
                    its prodigious extension; and he continued to enrich it in all its departments
                    with innumerable improvements and fine discoveries, during the whole course of a
                    most active, laborious, and protracted life. Unfortunately the philosophical
                    character of Euler did not correspond to his superlative eminence as a geometer.
                    Bred in the school of Leibnitz, he had imbibed the specious but delusive
                    metaphysics of the <hi rend="italic">sufficient reason,</hi> and of the
                    necessary and absolute constitution of the laws of nature. He was hence disposed
                    in all cases to prefer the mode of investigating <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori,</hi> and never appeared to hold in due estimation the humbler yet only
                    safe road to physical science, by the method of experiment and induction. Euler
                    expressed the indices of refraction by the powers of a certain invariable root,
                    and fancied that the exponents of those powers are proportional for the several
                    rays in different media. Instead of making, in short, the numbers themselves
                    proportional, as Newton had done, he assigned this property to their logarithms.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Berlin Memoirs</hi> for 1747, he inserted a short
                    paper, in which he deducted from his optical principle, by a clear analytical
                    process, conducted with his usual skill, the composition of a lens formed after
                    certain proportions with glass and water, which should remove entirely all
                    extraneous colours, whether occasioned by the unequal refraction of the several
                    rays, or by spherical aberration; and in concluding, he remarked, with high
                    satisfaction, the general conformity of his results with the wonderful structure
                    of the eye.</p>
                <p>But this paper met with opposition in a quarter where it could have been least
                    expected. John Dolland, who had afterwards the honour of completing one of the
                    finest and most valuable discoveries in the science of optics, was born in 1706,
                    in Spitalfields, of French parents, whom the revocation of the edict of Nantes
                    had compelled to take refuge in England, from the cruel persecution of a bigoted
                    and tyrannical court. Following his father’s occupation, that of a silk-weaver,
                    he married at an early age; and being fond of reading, he dedicated his leisure
                    moments to the acquisition of knowledge. By dint of solitary application, he
                    made some progress in the learned languages; but he devoted his main attention
                    to the study of geometry and algebra, and the more attractive parts of mixed or
                    practical mathematics. He gave instructions in these branches to his son Peter,
                    who, though bred to the hereditary profession, soon quitted that employment, and
                    commenced the business of optician, in which he was afterwards joined by his
                    father. Aþout this time the volume of the <hi rend="italic">Berlin Memoirs,</hi>
                    containing Euler’s paper, fell into the hands of the elder Dolland, who examined
                    it with care, and repeated the calculations. His report was communicated by Mr
                    Short to the Royal Society in 1752, and published in their Transactions for that
                    year. Dolland, as might well be expected, could detect no mistake in the
                    investigation itself, but strenuously contested the principle on which it was
                    built, as differing from the one laid down by Newton, which he held to be
                    irrefragable. “It is, therefore,” says he, rather uncourteously, and certainly
                    with little of the prophetic spirit, “it is, therefore, somewhat strange that
                    any body now-a-days should attempt to do that which so long ago has been
                    demonstrated impossible.” The great Euler replied with becoming temper, but
                    persisted in maintaining that his optical principle was a true and necessary law
                    of nature, though he frankly confessed that he had not been able to reduce it
                    yet to practice. The dispute now began to provoke attention on the Continent. In
                    1754, Klingenstierna, an eminent Swedish geometer, demonstrated that the
                    Newtonian principle is in some extreme cases incompatible with the phenomena,
                    and therefore ought not to be received as an undoubted law of nature. Thus
                    pressed on all sides, Dolland at length had recourse to that appeal which should
                    have been made from the beginning,— to the test of actual experiment. He
                    constructed a hollow wedge with two plates of glass, ground parallel, in which
                    he laid inverted a common glass prism, and filled up the space with clear water,
                    as in the annexed figure.</p>
                <p>He now continued to enlarge the angle of the wedge, till the refraction produced
                    by the water came to counterbalance exactly the opposite refraction of the
                    glass, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031135" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1135-0102"
                    />must obtain whenever an object is seen through the compound prism, without
                    change of direction, in its true place. But, contrary to what he so firmly
                    expected, the external objects appeared glaringly bordered with coloured
                    fringes; as much, indeed, as if they had been viewed through a glass prism with
                    an angle of thirty degrees. It was therefore quite decisive that Newton had not
                    performed his experiment with scrupulous accuracy, and had trusted rather too
                    hastily to mere analogical inference. But to remove every shadow of doubt from
                    the subject, Mr Dolland, finding that large angles were inconvenient for
                    observation, ground a prism to the very acute angle of nine degrees, and
                    adjusted, by careful trials, a wedge of water to the same precise measure of
                    refraction. Combining the opposite refractions as before, he beheld, on looking
                    through the apparatus (as here represented), their various objects real
                    position, but distinctly marked with the prismatic colours. In these
                    experiments, although the mean ray pursues the same undeviating course, the
                    extreme rays which enter parallel with it emerge from the compound prism,
                    spreading out on both sides.</p>
                <p>The capital point being completely ascertained, Holland next tried so to adapt
                    the opposite refractions as to destroy all extraneous colour. This effect he
                    found to take place when the angle of the wedge had been further increased, till
                    the refracting power of the water was to that of the glass in the ratio of five
                    to four. His conclusive experiments were made in 1757, and he lost no time in
                    applying their results to the improvement of the objectglasses of telescopes.
                    Following the proportion just ascertained, he conjoined a very deep convex lens
                    of water with a concave one of glass. In this way he succeeded in removing the
                    colours occasioned by the unequal refraction of light; but the images formed in
                    the foci of the telescopes so constructed, still wanted the distinctness which
                    might have been expected. The defect now proceeded, it was evident, merely from
                    spherical aberration; for the excess of refraction in the compound lens being
                    very small, the surfaces were necessarily formed to a deep curvature.</p>
                <p>But this partial success only stimulated the ingenious artist to make further
                    trials. Having proved that the separation of the extreme rays, or what has been
                    since termed the <hi rend="italic">dispersive power,</hi> is not proportioned to
                    the mean refraction in the case of glass and water, he might fairly presume that
                    like discrepancies must exist among other diaphanous substances, and even among
                    the different kinds of glass itself. The charm of uniformity being once
                    dispelled, he was encouraged to proceed, with the confident hope of ultimately
                    achieving his purpose. His new researches, however, were postponed for some time
                    by the pressure of business. But on resuming the inquiry, he found the English
                    crown-glass and the foreign yellow or straw-coloured, commonly called the Venice
                    glass, to disperse the extreme rays almost alike, while the crystal, or white
                    flint-glass, gave a much greater measure of dispersion. On this quarter,
                    therefore, he centred his attention. A wedge of crown and another of flint-glass
                    were ground till they refracted equally, which took place when their angles were
                    respectively 29 and 25 degrees, or the indices of refraction were nearly as 22
                    to 19; but on being joined in an inverted position, they produced, without
                    changing the general direction of the pencil, a very different divergence of the
                    compound rays of light. He now reversed the experiment, and formed wedges of
                    crown and flint-glass to such angles as might destroy all irregularity of colour
                    by their opposite dispersions.</p>
                <p>When this condition was obtained, the refractive powers of those wedges of crown
                    and flint-glass were nearly in the ratio of three to two, and consequently the
                    sines of half their angles, or the angles themselves, if small, were as 33 to
                    19, or nearly as 7 to 4. The rays which enter parallel now escape likewise
                    parallel, but all of them deflected equally from their course.</p>
                <p>The appearance was rendered still more conspicuous by repeating the combination
                    of the glass wedges, as in the figure here adjoined. It will be perceived that
                    the pencils of rays which enter at equal distances on both sides of the common
                    junction, must nearly meet in the same point of the axis; for in small arcs the
                    chords are almost proportional to the arcs themselves. This arrangement, indeed,
                    with the projecting wedge of crown-glass in front, represents actually the
                    composition of an object-glass formed of two distinct and opposing lenses, which
                    would produce a similar effect. It was only required to apply a semi-convex lens
                    of crown-glass before a semi-concave one of flint-glass, such that the curvature
                    of the former be to that of the latter nearly as 7 to 4; but with some
                    modifications in this ratio, according to the peculiar qualities of the glass.
                    [The figure annexed represents this combination^ But the depth of the lenses
                    might be diminished, by giving them curvature on both sides. Thus, if a double
                    convex of crown-glass were substituted, of the same power, and consequently with
                    only half the curvature on each side; the lens of flint-glass adapted to it
                    having, therefore, their common surface of an equal concavity, would need, in
                    order to produce the former quantity of refraction, and consequently to maintain
                    the balance of opposite dispersions, a concavity eight times less than before on
                    the other surface. Or if a double concave of flint-glass with half its first
                    depth were used, the front convexity of the lens of crown-glass would be
                    five-sevenths of the former curvature, as here represented. The surface where
                    the two lenses are united may hence have its curvature changed at pleasure; but
                    every alteration of this must occasion corresponding changes in the exterior
                    surfaces.</p>
                <p>In all these cases, the refraction of the convex pieces being reduced to
                    one-third by the contrary refraction of the concave piece, the focal distance of
                    the compound glass must be triple of that which it would have had singly. But a
                    most important advantage results from the facility of varying the adaptation of
                    the lenses; for, by rightly proportioning the conspiring and counteracting
                    curvatures, it was possible to remove almost entirely the errors arising from
                    spherical aberration. This delicate problem Mr Dolland was the better prepared
                    to encounter, as he had already, in 1753, improved the telescope materially, by
                    introducing no fewer than six eye-glasses, disposed at proper distances, to
                    divide the refraction. The research itself, and the execution of the compound
                    lens, presented peculiar difficulties; but the ingenuity and toilsome exertions
                    of the artist were at length, in 1758, rewarded with complete success.
                    “Notwithstanding,” says he, in concluding <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031148"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1148-0103"/>his paper, “so many difficulties as I have
                    enumerated, I have, after numerous trials, and a resolute perseverance, brought
                    the matter at last to such an issue, that I can construct refracting telescopes,
                    with such apertures and magnifying powers, under limited lengths, as, in the
                    opinion of the best and undeniable judges, who have experienced them, far exceed
                    any thing that has been produced, as representing objects with great
                    distinctness, and in their true colours.”</p>
                <p>The Royal Society voted to Mr Dolland, for his valuable discovery, the honour of
                    the Copley medal. To this new construction of the telescope Dr Bevis gave the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Achromatic</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">α</hi>
                    privative, and <hi rend="italic">χj&gt;ωμα, colour^),</hi> which was soon
                    universally adopted, and is still retained. The inventor took out a patent, but
                    did not live to reap the fruits of his ingenious labours. He died in the year
                    1761, leaving the prosecution of the business to his son and associate Peter
                    Dolland, who realized a very large fortune by the exclusive manufacture, for
                    many years, of achromatic glasses, less secured to him by the invidious and
                    disputed provisions of legal monopoly, than by superior skill, experience, and
                    sedulous attention. In 1765, the younger Dolland made another and final
                    improvement, to which his father had before advanced some steps. To correct more
                    effectually the spherical aberration, he formed the objectglass of three instead
                    of two lenses, by dividing the convex piece; or he inclosed a concave lens of
                    flint-glass between two convex lenses of crown-glass, as exactly represented in
                    the figure here annexed. He showed a telescope of this improved construction,
                    having a focal length of three feet and a half, with an aperture of three inches
                    and three quarters, to the celebrated Mr Short, who tried it with a magnifying
                    power of one hundred and fifty times, and who, superior to the jealousy of
                    rivalship, and disposed to patronise rising merit, most warmly recommended it,
                    and declared that he found “the image distinct, bright, and free from
                    colours.”</p>
                <p>What were the curvatures of those distinct component lenses, Dolland has not
                    mentioned, and perhaps he rather wished to conceal them. The Duke de Chaulnes
                    was enabled, however, by means of a sort of micrometer, to ascertain the radii
                    of the several surfaces, in the case of one object-glass of the best
                    composition. He found these radii, beginning with the front lens, to be
                    respectively 311½, 392; 214, 294; 294 and 322½, in French lines, which
                    corresponded, in English inches, to 32∙4, 40*8; 22∙2, 30∙6; 30∙6 and 33∙5. If
                    these measures were correct, however, it would follow, that the middle lens of
                    flint-glass was not perfectly adapted to the curvature of the lens of
                    crown-glass placed immediately before it. Similar admeasurements have been
                    repeated by others, but the results differ considerably, and no general
                    conclusion can be safely drawn. There is no doubt that the artist varied his
                    practice, according to the nature of the glass which he was obliged to use. The
                    more ordinary proportions for the curvatures of the component lenses would be
                    represented by a truncated prism, formed with a double cluster of wedges, the
                    outer ones having angles of 25° 53', and 14° 27', and consisting of crown-glass,
                    and the inner one made of flint-glass, with an inverted angle of 27° 3'. These
                    two wedges of crown-glass would produce the same refraction, it might be shown,
                    as a single one having an angle of 40° 54∖∙ wherefore this refraction will be
                    diminished, by the opposite influence of the wedge of flint glass, in the ratio
                    of 49 to 16, or reduced to nearly one-third..</p>
                <p>Thus was achieved, and fully carried into practical operation, the finest and
                    most important detection made in optics since the great discovery of the unequal
                    refraction of the several rays of light. It was drawn forth by a long series of
                    trials, directed with judgment and ingenuity, but certainly very little aided by
                    the powers of calculation. Such a slow tentative procedure was perhaps the best
                    suited, however, to the habits of an artist, and it had at least the advantage
                    of leaving no doubt or hesitation behind it. On this occasion, we cannot help
                    being struck with a remark, that most of those who have ever distinguished
                    themselves in the philosophical arts by their original improvements, were seldom
                    regularly bred to the profession. Both the Dollands, we have seen, began life
                    with plying at the loom; Short had a liberal education, being designed for the
                    Scotish church, but, indulging a taste for practical optics, he afterwards
                    followed it as a trade, in which he rose to pre-eminence; Ramsden, whose
                    ingenuity and exquisite skill were quite unrivalled, was bred a clothier in
                    Yorkshire; Tassie, who revived or created among us the nice art of casting gems,
                    was originally a stone-mason at Glasgow; and Watt, who, by his very happy
                    applications of mechanics, and his vast improvements on the steam-engine, has,
                    more than any other individual perhaps, contributed to the great national
                    advancement, was early an ivory-turner in that same city,, and still found
                    pleasure, in his declining years, with the amusement of the lathe. We might
                    easily enlarge this catalogue; but enough has been said to prove the justness of
                    the observation, and it suggests reflections which are not favourable to fixed
                    and systematic plans of education.</p>
                <p>The theory of achromatic telescopes, embraced in all its extent, opened a field
                    of abstruse and difficult investigation. But the English mathematicians at that
                    period, though they might appear to be especially invited to the discussion,
                    very generally neglected so fine an opportunity for the exercise of their
                    genius. They coldly suffered the artists to grope their devious way, without
                    offering to guide their efforts by the lights of science. On the Continent the
                    geometers of the first order were all eager to attempt the solution of problems
                    at once so curious and important. For several years subsequent to 1758, the
                    Transactions of the foreign academies were filled with memoirs on the
                    combination of achromatic lenses, displaying the resources and refinements of
                    the modern analysis, by Euler, Clairaut, and D’Alembert,—by Boscovich,
                    Klingenstierna, Kaestner, and Hennert. On this, as on other occasions, however,
                    we have to regret the want of close union between artists and men of science.
                    Those profound investigations are generally too speculative for any real use;
                    they often involve imperfect or inaccurate data; and the results appear wrapped
                    in such comprehensive and intricate formulae, as to deter the artist from
                    endeavouring to reduce them into practice. We should have thought it preferable,
                    on the whole, not to load the solution of the main problem with minute
                    conditions, but to aim at a few general rules, which could afterwards be
                    modified in their application according to circumstances. All this might have
                    been accomplished, without scarcely travelling beyond the limits of elementary
                    geometry.</p>
                <p>Euler and his adherents at Berlin were still not disposed to abandon his
                    favourite optical hypothesis. It was even pretended that Dolland must have owed
                    his success to a nice correction of spherical aberration, and not to any really
                    superior dispersive power belonging to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031161"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1161-0104"/>flint-glass. But that candid philosopher
                    afterwards yielded to the force of reason and testimony; and, collecting his
                    various optical papers, he published, in the successive years 1769, 1770, and
                    1771, a complete treatise, on <hi rend="italic">Dioptrics,</hi> occupying three
                    quarto volumes, which contain a store of ingenious and elegant
                    disquisitions.</p>
                <p>The last memoir which Clairaut ever wrote related to achromatic glasses.
                    D’Alembert prosecuted the subject with diligence and ardour; and the volumes of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Opuscules,</hi> published between the years
                    1761 and 1767, contain some elaborate dioptrical investigations. Among other
                    conclusions which he deduced from his multiplied researches, he proposed a new
                    composition for the object-glass of a telescope, to consist of three lenses, the
                    outmost one being a meniscus of crown-glass, or having a convex and a concave
                    surface, then a meniscus of flint-glass in the middle, and adapted to this, on
                    the inside, a double convex of crown-glass. Of all the continental works,
                    however, which treat of achromatic combinations, the tracts of Boscovich, who
                    possessed a very fine taste for geometry, may be held as the simplest and
                    clearest. We cannot help noticing, by the way, a curious theorem of his
                    concerning the form and arrangement of eye-glasses, which would be free from
                    irregular colours. It is, that the correction will be produced by means of two
                    lenses of the same kind of glass, if separated from each other by an interval
                    equal to half the sum of their focal distances. This principle furnishes a very
                    simple construction for the common astronomical telescope, through which the
                    objects are seen inverted. In the annexed figure, the object-glass, as usual, is
                    achromatic, being composed of two convex lenses of crown-glass, with a concave
                    one of flint-glass fitted between them; but the eye-glass consists of two
                    distinct lenses of crown-glass, both of them convex, and exactly similar, the
                    first having every dimension triple that of the other, and their mutual distance
                    double the focal length of the smaller.</p>
                <p>Supposing, however, that the errors occasioned by spherical aberration were
                    completely removed, the principle of achromatic combination is yet far from
                    being so perfect as it has often been represented. Although the opposite
                    dispersions of the flint and of the crown-glass should bring together the
                    extreme rays, we are not, from this coincidence, warranted to infer that the
                    several intermediate rays would likewise be accurately blended. In fact, a wedge
                    of flint-glass not only separates all the rays much more than a similar one of
                    crown-glass, but divides the coloured spaces after different proportions. While
                    the combined lenses formed of those two kinds of glass give an image entirely
                    free from the red and violet borders, they may still introduce secondary shades
                    of green or yellow, sufficient to cause a certain degree of indistinctness. The
                    mode of correcting this defect would be, to produce a counterbalance of colours,
                    by conjoining several media endued with different refractive and dispersive
                    powers. In these qualities, crown-glass itself admits of some variation, owing
                    to the measure of saline ingredient; but flint-glass differs widely with regard
                    to its optical properties, owing chiefly to the diversified proportion of minium
                    or oxyde of lead which enters into its composition, and partly to the variable
                    admixture of manganese employed to discharge the yellow tint occasioned by the
                    lead. Manifest advantages, therefore, would result from a choice combination of
                    three or more varieties of glass, since both the primary and the secondary
                    deviations of colour would be corrected. Without pretending to any theoretical
                    perfection, every thing really wanted in practice would be thus attained. A
                    series of nice experiments on the optical relations of glass could not fail, by
                    their results, to reward the assiduity of the ingenious artist He would trace
                    and determine the separate influence exerted on the refractive and dispersive
                    powers by soda in the crown-glass, and by minium and manganese in the
                    flint-glass. It is highly probable, that with perseverance he might discover a
                    vitreous composition better adapted than any yet known for achromatic purposes.
                    It is very generally believed, that the achromatic telescopes now manufactured
                    in London are not of the same excellence with those first made by Peter Dolland.
                    This declension of such a beautiful art has frequently been imputed to the
                    baneful operation of a severe and oppressive system of excise. Whether the new
                    mode of charging the duty on glass at the annealing arch has produced any
                    beneficial effects, we are still to learn.</p>
                <p>An extensive and ingenious set of experiments on the dispersive powers of
                    different liquids, was undertaken, about the year 1787, and successfully
                    prosecuted for some time afterwards, by Dr Robert Blair, for whom there had been
                    recently created,· under royal patronage, the chair of practical astronomy in
                    the University of Edinburgh; one of the very few professorships in that
                    distinguished seminary which have been suffered to remain inefficient and merely
                    nominal. Of these experiments, a judicious account was, in 1790, communicated by
                    their author to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in a paper drawn up with evident
                    ability, but rather too diffuse, and unnecessarily digressive. Dr Blair had a
                    very small brass prism perforated with a hole, which he filled with a few drops
                    of the liquid to be examined, and confined each end by a plate of glass with
                    parallel surfaces. He then applied, inverted to the prism in succession, a
                    number of glass wedges which he had provided of different angles, and observed,
                    when the bars of the window, seen through this compound prism, appeared
                    colourless, the angle of the wedge now expressed the relative dispersive power
                    of the liquid. This way of experimenting was sufficiently simple, but a more
                    accurate and expeditious method might have easily been devised. For instance, if
                    the prism, furnished with a graduated arch, had remained fixed, and a single
                    glass wedge made to turn upon it, and present successive. inclinations to the
                    observer, the refracting angle at which the irregular colours were united could
                    be deduced by an easy calculation. Dr Blair found, by his trials, that muriatic
                    acid, in all its combinations, but particularly with antimony and mercury, shows
                    a very great dispersive power. The essential oils stood the next with regard to
                    that property, though differing considerably among themselves. In Dr Blair’s
                    first attempts to improve the achromatic telescope, he conjoined two compound
                    lenses; the one formed with a double concave of crown-glass and a semi-convex of
                    essential oil, and the other composed of a double convex filled with essential
                    oil, of great dispersive power, and of a semi-concave, likewise containing
                    essential oil, but less apt for dispersion. This very complex arrangement
                    seemed, however, to produce the desired effect, not only discharging from the
                    image the extreme fringes of red and violet, but excluding also the intermediate
                    shades of green or yellow. A simpler combination was afterwards used, requiring
                    merely one liquid, composed of muriatic acid joined with antimony, or the triple
                    salt of that acid united in certain proportions to ammonia and mercury. This
                    liquid, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031174" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1174-0105"/>being
                    accurately prepared, was inclosed between two thin glass shells, to form a
                    double convex lens: on the front was applied a semi-convex of crown-glass, and a
                    meniscus of the same material behind, the whole being secured by a glass ring.
                    An object-glass so constructed seemed to perform its office with great
                    perfection, effectually correcting both the primary and the secondary admixture
                    of colours. This kind of eye-glass Dr Blair proposed to denominate <hi
                    rend="italic">aplanatic</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">α</hi> privative, and πλ
                    <hi rend="italic">ανα</hi> ω, to <hi rend="italic">err</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >wander),</hi> and he obtained a patent for his invention. The late George
                    Adams, optician in Fleet Street, was intrusted with the fabrication and sale of
                    the telescopes thus constructed. Some of them were said to answer extremely
                    well; but, whether from want of activity on the part of the tradesman, or from
                    defect of temper in the patentee, these instruments never acquired much
                    circulation. It was alleged that the liquid by degrees lost its transparency.
                    Indeed we suspect that there is no combination in which liquids are concerned,
                    which can be judged sufficiently permanent for optical purposes. It seems hardly
                    possible to preclude absolutely the impression of the external air; the liquid
                    must, therefore, have a tendency both to evaporate and to crystallize; and, in
                    the course of time, it will probably, by its activity, corrode the surfaces of
                    the glass.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of achromatic telescopes in England furnished, for a long period,
                    a very profitable article of exportation. Even after the introduction of those
                    instruments was prohibited by several foreign governments, the object-glasses
                    themselves, in a more compendious form, were smuggled abroad to a large amount.
                    In fact, no flint-glass of a good quality was then made on the Continent. A very
                    material alteration, however, in that respect, has taken place, at least in
                    France, where the stimulus impressed by the revolution has worked so many
                    changes, and where ingenuity and science, in most of the mechanical arts, have
                    so visibly supplied the scantiness of capital. The French now construct
                    achromatic telescopes, equal, if not superior, to any that are made in England.
