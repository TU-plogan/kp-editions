                    celebrated as the author who raised the Italian tragic drama from its previous
                    state of degradation, was born on the 17th January 1749, at the town of Asti, in
                    Piedmont. He lost his father in early infancy; but he continued to reside with
                    his mother, who married a second time, till his tenth year, when he was placed
                    at the academy of Turin. After he had passed a twelvemonth at the academy, he
                    went on a short visit to a relation who dwelt at Coni; and during his stay there
                    he made his first poetical attempt, in a sonnet chiefly borrowed from lines in
                    Ariosto and Metastasio, the only poets he had at that time read. When thirteen
                    years of age, he was induced to commence the study of civil and canonical law;
                    but the attempt only served to disgust him with every species of application,
                    and to increase his relish for the perusal of French romances.</p>
                <p>By the death of his uncle, who had hitherto taken some charge of his education
                    and conduct, he was left, at the age of fourteen, to enjoy without control his
                    vast paternal inheritance, augmented by the recent accession of his uncle’s
                    fortune. He now began to attend the ridingschool, where he acquired that rage
                    for horses and equestrian exercise which continued to be one of his strongest
                    passions till the close of his existence.</p>
                <p>After some time spent in alternate fits of extravagant dissipation and
                    ill-directed study, he was seized with a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193035217"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-5217-0416"/>deśire of travelling; and having obtained
                    permission from the king, he departed, in 1766, under the care of an English
                    preceptor. Restless and unquiet, he posted with the utmost rapidity through the
                    towns of Italy; and his improvement was such as was to be expected from his mode
                    of travelling and his previous habits. Dissatisfied with himself, he felt as
                    little relish for spectacles or entertainments as for literature; and was as
                    little amused by the gaiety of a carnival at Naples, as he was impressed by the
                    remains of antiquity at Rome,· or the exhibitions of modern art at Florence and
                    Bologna. This indifference and insensibility did not, however, arise from defect
                    of talent or the ∙natural powers of taste, but from the want of some serious
                    passion, or some ennobling or praiseworthy pursuit. Hoping to find in foreign
                    countries some relief from the 'tedium and <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi> with
                    which he was oppressed, and being anxious to become acquainted with the French
                    theatre, he proceeded to Paris; but his feelings were only those of disgust or
                    indifference for the dramas which he saw represented in that capital. He seems,
                    indeed, to have been completely dissatisfied with every thing he witnessed in
                    France, and contracted a dislike to its people, which his intercourse in future
                    years rather contributed to augment than diminish. In Holland he became deeply
                    enamoured of a married lady, who returned his attachment, but who was soon
                    obliged to accompany her husband to Switzerland. Alfieri, whose feelings were of
                    the most impetuous description, was in despair at this separation, and returned
                    to his own country in the utmost anguish and despondency of mind. While under
                    this depression of spirits, he was induced to seek alleviation from works of
                    literature; and the perusal of Plutarch’s Lives, which he read with profound
                    emotion, inspired him with an enthusiastic passion for freedom and independence.
                    Under the influence of this rage for liberty he recommenced his travels; and his
                    only gratification, in the absence of freedom among the Continental States,
                    appears to have been derived from contemplating the wild and sterile regions of
                    the north of Sweden, where gloomy forests, lakes, and precipices conspired to
                    excite those sublime and melancholy ideas which were congenial to his
                    disposition. Human manners and human institutions he seems invariably to have
                    surveyed with an eye of passion or prejudice, instead of viewing them with the
                    calmness of a philosopher, who meditates how they may be rectified, or what
                    lessons may be drawn from them. In every country his soul felt as if confined by
                    the bonds of society: he everywhere panted for something more free in
                    governments, more elevated in sentiment, more devoted in love, and more perfect
                    in friendship. In search of this ideal world, he posted through various
                    countries, more with the rapidity of a courier than of one who travels for
                    amusement or instruction. During a journey to London, he engaged in an intrigue
                    with a married lady of high rank; and having been detected, the publicity of a
                    rencounter with the injured husband, and of a divorce, which followed, united to
                    the knowledge he now acquired of the infamous character of the woman, to whom he
                    was ardently attached, rendered it expedient and desirable for him to quit
                    England. He then visited Spain and Portugal, where he became acquainted with the
                    Abbé Caluso, who remained through life the most attached and estimable friend he
                    ever possessed. In 1772 Alfieri returned to Turin, where he again became
                    enamoured of a lady, whom he loved with his usual ardour, and who seems to have
                    been as undeserving of a sincere attachment as those he had hitherto adored. In
                    the course of a long attendance on his mistress, during a malady with which she
                    was afflicted, he one day wrote a dialogue, or scene of a drama, which he left
                    at -this lady’s house. About a year after, on a difference taking place between
                    them, this piece was returned to him. Having then retouched and extended it t
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> five acts, it was performed at Turin in 1775, under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi> whose amours had always been a
                    favourite subject with Italian dramatists.</p>
                <p>From this moment Alfieri was seized with an immeasurable thirst of theatrical
                    fame, and the remainder of his life was devoted to its attainment. His first two
                    tragedies, <hi rend="italic">Filippo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polinice,</hi>
                    were originally written in French prose; and when he came to versify them in
                    Italian, he found that, from his Lombard origin, and long intercourse with
                    foreigners, he expressed himself with feebleness and inaccuracy. Accordingly,
                    with the view of improving his Italian style, he went to Tuscany, and, during an
                    alternate residence at Florence and Sienna, he completed his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Filip, po</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polinice,</hi> and conceived the plan of
                    various other dramas. While thus employed, he became acquainted with the
                    countess of Albany, who then resided with her husband at Florence. For her he
                    formed an attachment which, if less violent than his former loves, appears to
                    have been more permanent. With this motive to remain at Florence, he could not
                    endure the chains by which his vast possessions bound him to Piedmont. He
                    therefore resigned his whole property to his sister, the countess Cumiana,
                    reserving an annuity, which scarcely amounted to a half of his original
                    revenues. At this period the countess of Albany, urged by the ill treatment she
                    received from her husband, sought refuge in Rome, where she at length received
                    permission from the pope to live apart from her tormentor. Alfieri followed the
                    countess to that capital, where he completed fourteen tragedies, four of which
                    were now for the first time printed at Sienna.</p>
                <p>At length, however, it was thought proper, that, by leaving Rome, he should
                    remove the aspersions which had been thrown on the object of his affections.
                    During the year 1783, he therefore travelled through different states of Italy,
                    and published six additional tragedies. The interests of his love and literary
                    glory had not diminished his rage for horses, which seems to have been at least
                    the third passion of his soul. He came to England solely for the purpose of
                    purchasing a number of these animals, which he brought with him to Italy. On his
                    return he learned that the countess of Albany had gone to Colmar in Alsace,
                    where he joined her, and resided with her under the same roof during the rest of
                    his life. They chiefly passed their time between Alsace and Paris, but at length
                    took up their abode entirely in that metropolis. While here, Alfieri made
                    arrangements with Didot for an edition of his tragedies; but was soon after
                    forced to quit Paris by the storms of the Revolution. He recrossed the Alps with
                    the countess, and finally settled at Florence. The last ten years of his life,
                    which he spent in that city, seem to have been the happiest of his existence.
                    During that long period his tranquillity was only interrupted by the entrance of
                    the revolutionary armies into Florence m 1799. Though an enemy of kings, the
                    aristocratic feelings of Alfieri rendered him also a decided foe to the
                    principles and leaders of the French Revolution; and he rejected, with the
                    utmost contempt, those advances which were made with a view to bring him over to
                    their cause.. The concluding years of his life were laudably employed in the
                    study of Greek literature, and in perfecting a series of comedies. His assiduous
                    labour on this object, which he pursued with his characteristic impetuosity,
                    exhausted his strength, and brought on a malady, for which he would not adopt
                    the prescriptions of his physicians, but obstinate y persisted in employing
                    remedies of his own. Under this regimen his disorder rapidly increased, and at

                <p>minated his life on the 8th October 1803, in the fifty-fifth year of his age.</p>
                <p>The character of Alfieri may be best appreciated from the portrait which he has
                    drawn of himself in his own <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of his Life.</hi> He was
                    evidently of an irritable, impetuous, and almost ungovernable temper. Pride,
                    which .seems to have been a ruling sentiment, may account for many apparent
                    inconsistencies of his character. While it made him abhor kings, because
                    superior to himself, it led him to detest those republicans who, by too near an
                    approach, contaminated aristocratic dignity; and it induced him, while yet
                    undistinguished himself, and panting for literary fame, to decline a proffered
                    introduction to Metastasio and Rousseau. But as all his bad qualities were
                    greatly softened by the cultivation of literature, it may be presumed, that a
                    better education, and an earlier employment of his faculties, would have
                    rendered him a much more perfect character. His application to study gradually
                    tranquillized his temper and softened his manners, leaving him at the same time
                    in perfect possession of those good qualities which he had inherited from
                    nature,—a warm and disinterested attachment to his family and friends, united to
                    a generosity, vigour, and elevation of character, which rendered him not
                    unworthy to embody in his dramas the actions and sentiments of Grecian
                    heroes.</p>
                <p>To these dramas Alfieri is chiefly indebted for the high reputation to which he
                    has attained. Before his time the Italian language, so harmonious in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sonnets</hi> of Petrarch, and so energetic in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Commedia</hi> of Dante, had been invariably languid and prosaic in
                    dramatic dialogue. The pedantic and inanimate tragedies of the sixteenth century
                    were followed, during the iron age of Italian literature, by dramas, of which
                    extravagance in the sentiments, and improbability in the action, were the chief
                    characteristics. The prodigious success of the <hi rend="italic">Merope</hi> of
                    Maffei, which appeared in the commencement of the last century, may be
                    attributed more to a comparison with such productions, than to intrinsic merit.
                    In this degradation of tragic taste, the appearance of the tragedies of Alfieri
                    was perhaps the most important literary event that had occurred in Italy during
                    the eighteenth century. On these tragedies it is difficult to pronounce a
                    judgment, as the taste and system of the author underwent considerable change
                    and modification during the intervals which elapsed between the three periods of
                    their publication. An excessive harshness of style, an asperity of sentiment,
                    and total want of poetical ornament, are the characteristics of his first four
                    tragedies, <hi rend="italic">Filippo, Polinice, Antigone,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Virginia.</hi> These faults were in some measure corrected in the
                    six tragedies which he gave to the world some years after, and in those which he
                    published along with <hi rend="italic">Saul,</hi> the drama which enjoyed the
                    greatest success of all his productions; a popularity which may be partly
                    attributed to the severe and unadorned manner of Alfieri being well adapted to
                    the patriarchal simplicity of the age in which the scene of the tragedy is
                    placed. But though there be a considerable difference in his dramas, there are
                    certain observations applicable to them all. None of the plots are of his own
                    invention. They are founded either on mythological fable or history; most of
                    them had been previously treated by the Greek dramatists, or by Seneca. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ros-mιιηdα,</hi> the only one which could be supposed of his own
                    contrivance, and which is certainly the least happy effusion of his genius, is
                    partly founded on the eighteenth novel of the third part of Bandello, and partly
                    on Prevost s <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">un Homme</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Qualité.</hi> But whatever subjects he chooses, his dramas are
                    always formed on the Grecian model, and breathe a freedom and independence
                    worthy of an Athenian poet. Indeed, his <hi rend="italic">Agide</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Bruto</hi> may rather be considered oratorical declamations and
                    dialogues on liberty, than tragedies. The unities of time and place are not so
                    scrupulously observed in his as in the ancient dramas; but he has rigidly
                    adhered to a unity of action and interest. He occupies his scene with one great
                    action and one ruling passion, and removes from it every accessary event or
                    feeling. In this excessive zeal for the observance of unity, he seems to have
                    forgotten that its charm consists in producing a common relation between
                    multiplied feelings, and not in the bare exhibition of one, divested of those
                    various accompaniments which give harmony to the whole. Consistently with that
                    austere and simple manner which he considered the chief excellence of dramatic
                    composition, he excluded from his scene all <hi rend="italic">coups de
                    theatre,</hi> all philosophical reflections, and that highly ornamented
                    versification which had been so assiduously cultivated by his predecessors. In
                    his anxiety, however, to avoid all superfluous ornament, he has stripped his
                    dramas of the embellishments of imagination; and for the harmony and flow of
                    poetical language he has substituted, even in his best performances, a style
                    which, though correct and pure, is generally harsh, elaborate, and abrupt; often
                    strained into unnatural energy, or condensed into factitious conciseness. The
                    chief excellence of Alfieri consists in powerful delineation of dramatic
                    character. In his Philip II. he has represented, almost with the masterly
                    touches of Tacitus, the sombre character, the dark mysterious counsels, the <hi
                    rend="italic">suspensa</hi><hi rend="italic">semper</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">obscura verba,</hi> of the modern Tiberius. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Polinice,</hi> the characters of the rival brothers are
                    beautifully contrasted; in <hi rend="italic">Maria Stuarda,</hi> that
                    unfortunate queen is represented unsuspicious, impatient of contradiction, and
                    violent in her attachments. In <hi rend="italic">Mirra,</hi> the character of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ciniro</hi> is perfect as a father and king, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cecri</hi> is a model of the virtues of a wife and mother. In the
                    representation of that species of mental alienation where the judgment has
                    perished, but traces of character still remain, he is peculiarly happy. The
                    insanity of Saul is skilfully managed; and the horrid joy of Orestes in killing
                    Egisthus rises finely and naturally to madness, in finding that, at the same
                    time, he had inadvertently slain his mother.</p>
                <p>Whatever mav be the merits or defects of Alfieri, he may be considered as the
                    founder of a new school in the Italian drama. His country hailed him as her sole
                    tragic poet; and his successors in the same path of literature have regarded his
                    bold, austere, and rapid manner, as the genuine model of tragic composition.</p>
                <p>Besides his tragedies, Alfieri published during his life many sonnets, five odes
                    on American independence, and the poem of <hi rend="italic">Etruria,</hi>
                    founded on the assassination of Alexander I. duke of Florence. Of his prose
                    works, the most distinguished for animation and eloquence is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Panegyric on Trajan,</hi> composed in a transport of indignation
                    at the supposed feebleness of Plinys eulogium. The two books, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">La Tirannide</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Essays on Literature
                    and Government,</hi> are remarkable for elegance and vigour of style, but are
                    too evidently imitations of the manner of Machiavel. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antigallican·,</hi> which was written at the same time with his <hi
                    rend="italic">Defence of Louis XVI.,</hi> comprehends an historical and
                    satirical view of the French Revolution. The posthumous works of Alfieri consist
                    of satires, six political comedies, and the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    his</hi><hi rend="italic">Life</hi><hi rend="italic">—Ά</hi> work which will
                    always be read with interest, in spite of the cold and languid gravity with
                    which he delineates the most interesting adventures and the strongest passions
                    of his agitated life. See <hi rend="italic">Mem. di</hi><hi rend="italic"
