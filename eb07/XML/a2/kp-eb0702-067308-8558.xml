                    in conversation and recorded by their friends, or discovered among their papers
                    after their decease. Though the term Ana is but of modern origin, the species of
                    composition to which it has been applied is not of such recent date as some
                    persons have imagined. It appears, from D’Herbelot’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothèque Orientale,</hi> that, since the earliest periods, the eastern
                    nations have been in the habit of preserving the maxims of their sages. From
                    them this practice passed to the Greeks and Romans. Plato and Xenophon treasured
                    up and recorded the sayings of their master Socrates. From their example Arrian,
                    in the concluding books of his <hi rend="italic">Enchiridion,</hi> which have
                    not descended to posterity, collected the casual observations which had dropped
                    from Epictetus. The numerous apophthegms seattered in Plutarch, Diogenes
                    Laertius, and other writers, evince that it had been customary in Greece to
                    preserve the ideas delivered by illustrious characters. It appears that Julius
                    Caesar compiled a book of apophthegms, in which he related the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bon-mots</hi> of Cicero; and Quintilian informs us, that a freedman of that
                    celebrated wit and orator composed three books of a work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Jocis Ciceronis.</hi> We are told by
                    Suetonius, that Caius Melissus, originally the slave, but afterwards the
                    freedman and librarian, of Maecenas, collected the sayings of his master; and
                    Aulus Gellius has filled his <hi rend="italic">Noctes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Atticae</hi> with anecdotes which he heard from those distinguished characters
                    whose society he frequented in Rome. Were the books compiled by the freedmen of
                    Cicero and Maecenas now extant, they might be entitled Ana; and it is certainly
                    to be regretted that we possess no authentic record of the conversational
                    remarks or hints which dropped from the sages, orators, or statesmen of Greece
                    and Rome. How interesting would be a <hi rend="italic">Colloquia Mensalia</hi>
                    of Atticus or Caesar!</p>
                <p>But though vestiges of this species of composition may be traced in the classical
                    ages, it is only in modern times that it has attained to full popularity and
                    perfection. Literary anecdotes, critical reflections, and historical incidents,
                    came to be mingled with the detail of <hi rend="italic">bon-mots</hi> and
                    ludicrous tales; so that instruction and entertainment were agreeably blended.
                    The term Ana seems to have been applied to such collections as far back as the
                    beginning of the fifteenth century. Thus, Francesco Barbaro, in a letter to
                    Poggio, says, that the information and anecdotes which Poggio and Barthelemi
                    Montepolitiano had picked up during a literary excursion through Germany, will
                    be called <hi rend="italic">Ana:</hi> “Quemadmodum mala ab Appio e Claudia gente
                    <hi rend="italic">Appiana,</hi> et pira a Mallio <hi rend="italic">Malliana</hi>
                    cognominata sunt, sic haec literarum quae vestra ope et opera Germania in
                    Italiam deferetur, aliquando et <hi rend="italic">Poggiana</hi> et <hi
                    rend="italic">Montepolitiana</hi> vocabuntur.”</p>
                <p>Poggio Bracciolini, to whom this letter is addressed, and to whom the world is
                    indebted for the preservation of so many classical remains, is the first eminent
                    person of modern times whose jests and opinions have been transmitted to
                    posterity. Poggio was secretary to five successive popes. During the pontificate
                    of Martin V., who was chosen in 1417, Poggio and other members of the Roman
                    chancery were in the habit of assembling in a common hall adjoining the Vatican,
                    in order to converse freely on all subjects. Being more studious of wit than of
                    truth, they termed this apartment <hi rend="italic">Buggiale,</hi> a word
                    signifying a place of recreation where tales are related, and which Poggio
                    himself interprets <hi rend="italic">Mendaciorum Officina.</hi> At these
                    meetings Poggio and his friends discussed the news and scandal of the day, and
                    communicated to each other entertaining anecdotes; they attacked what they did
                    not approve, and they approved of little; they also indulged in the utmost
                    latitude of satiric remark, dealing out their sarcasms with such impartiality,
                    that they did not spare even the pope and cardinals. The pointed jests and
                    humorous stories which occurred in these unrestrained conversations were
                    collected by Poggio, and formed the chief materials of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Facetiae,</hi> first printed, according to De Bure, in 1470. This celebrated
                    collection, which forms a principal part of the <hi rend="italic">Poggiana,</hi>
                    is chiefly valuable as recording interesting anecdotes of eminent men of the
                    fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It also contains a number of quibbles or <hi
                    rend="italic">jeux-de-mots,</hi> and a still greater number of idle and
                    licentious stories. Many of these, however, are not original, some of them being
                    taken from ancient authors, and a still greater number from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fabliaux</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Trouveurs.</hi> Thus, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Fabliau</hi><hi rend="italic">La Culotte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Cordeliers</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">Braccae Divi Francisci</hi> of
                    Poggio; <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Meunier dΛleus</hi> is
                    Poggio’s <hi rend="italic">Quinque Ova</hi><hi rend="italic">; Du Vilain et de
                    sa Femme</hi> is his <hi rend="italic">Mulier Demersa;</hi><hi rend="italic">and
                    Du Pre</hi><hi rend="italic">Tondu</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">Pertinacia
                    Muliebris</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Facetiae.</hi> On the other hand, Poggio
                    has suggested much to succeeding writers. Hans Carvel’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bing</hi> is his <hi rend="italic">Visio</hi><hi rend="italic">Francisci
                    Filelfi</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> ;</hi> and Fontaine’s fables, <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Charlatan,</hi><hi rend="italic">Le Coq
                    et le Renard,</hi> and that of the <hi rend="italic">ĩVolf and Fox pleading
                    before the Ape,</hi> are from stories originally related by Poggio. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Facetiae</hi> forms, upon the whole, the most amusing and
                    interesting part of the <hi rend="italic">Poggiana</hi> printed at Amsterdam in
                    1720; but this collection also comprehends some further anecdotes of his life,
                    and a few scattered maxims extracted from his graver compositions.</p>
                <p>Though Poggio was the first person whose remarks and <hi rend="italic"
                    >bon-mots</hi> were collected under the name of Ana, the <hi rend="superscript"
                    >Sealigerana,</hi> which contains the opinions of Joseph Scaliger, was the first
                    work <hi rend="italic">published</hi> under that appellation; and, accordingly,
                    may be regarded as having led the way to that class of publications.</p>
                <p>There are two collections called Scaligerana—a <hi rend="italic">ρrima</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">secunda</hi> Scaligerana. The first was compiled by a
                    physician named Francis Vertunien, Sieur de Lavau, who attended the family of
                    the Messieurs Chateigner, in whose house Joseph Scaliger resided. He, in
                    consequence, had frequent opportunities of meeting that celebrated critic, and
                    was in the custom of committing to paper the learned or ingenious observations
                    which dropped from him in the course of conversation; to which he occasionally
                    added remarks of his own. This collection, which was chiefly Latin, remained in
                    manuscript many years after the death of the compiler. It was at length
                    purchased by Μ. de Sigogne, who published it in 1669, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Prima</hi><hi rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nusquam antehac edita;</hi> bestowing upon it the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >prima,</hi> in order to preserve its claim of priority over another Scaligerana
                    which had been published three years before, but had been more recently
                    compiled. This second work, known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Secunda</hi><hi rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi> was collected by two brothers
                    of the name of Vassau, who went to complete their studies at the university of
                    Ley den, of which Scaliger was at that time one of the professors. Being
                    particularly recommended to Scaliger, they were received in his house, and daily
                    enjoyed his conversation; in the course of which, he gave them much information
                    concerning various topics of history and criticism. The Vassans immediately
                    wrote down what they had heard, and soon made up a large manuscript volume, in
                    which, however, there was neither connection nor arrangement of any description.
                    In this state the manuscript was delivered by one of the Vassans, on his
                    retirement to a monastery, to Μ. de Puy; and after passing through various
                    hands, it came into the possession of Μ. Daillé, who for his own use arranged in
                    alphabetical order the articles which it contained<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193038584" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8584-0675"/>. Isaac Vossius having come
                    to Paris on a visit to Μ. 'DaiΠe, obtained the loan of the manuscript, which he
                    transcribed, and afterwards published at the Hague, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi><hi rend="italic">sive Excerpta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ex ore Josephi Scaligeri.</hi> This edition was full of
                    inaccuracies and blunders; but a more correct impression was afterwards
                    published by Μ. Daillé, with a preface complaining of the use that Vossius had
                    made of the manuscript, which he declares was never intended for publication,
                    and was not of a nature to be given to the world. Indeed most literary men in
                    that age conceived that the <hi rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi> particularly the
                    <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> detracted considerably from the reputation of the
                    great scholar whose sentiments they recorded. They are full of mistakes and
                    contradictions; and Bayle has remarked, that the Vassans attribute to him
                    observations which it is almost impossible he could have uttered. Joseph
                    Scaliger, with more extensive erudition, but less genius than his father Julius
                    Caesar Scaliger, had inherited his ridiculous vanity and dogmatical spirit. He
                    wished it to be thought that he knew every thing, and that his opinions were
                    infallible. Conversing with two young students of a university, of which he
                    formed the principal ornament, he would probably be but little cautious in the
                    opinions he expressed, as his literary errors could not be detected or exposed.
                    Unfortunately the blind admiration of his pupils led them to regard even his
                    most absurd opinions as the responses of an oracle, and his most unmerited
                    censures as just condemnations. The <hi rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi>
                    accordingly, contains many falsehoods, with much unworthy personal abuse, of the
                    most distinguished characters of the age. Thus, he calls Cardinal Bellarmin a
                    mere atheist <hi rend="italic">{plane atheus),</hi> and compares the duke of
                    Sully to Sejanus. Indeed Μ. Daillé, in his preface to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Secunda</hi><hi rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi> confesses that it contains
                    “multa futilia, scurrilia, obscoena; quaedam manifeste falsa. Ubique de se
                    suisque magnifice, ne dicam thrasonice, loquitur; laudum parcus, conviciorum
                    largus, in omnes contumeliosissime invehitur: denique, neminem sibi de manibus
                    elabi patitur,, cujus non errata, vitia, naevos etiam levissimos, accrrime
                    insectetur, et plusquam cynica licentia arrodat.”</p>
                <p>In imitation of the <hi rend="italic">Scaligerana,</hi> a prodigious number of
                    similar works appeared in France towards the end of the seventeenth and
                    beginning of the eighteenth century. At first these collections were confined to
                    what had fallen from eminent men in conversation; but they were afterwards made
                    to embrace fragments found among their papers, and even passages extracted from
                    their works and epistolary correspondence. Of those which merely record the
                    conversations of eminent men, the best known, the fullest, and most valuable, is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Menagiana.</hi> Menage was a person of good sense, of
                    various and extensive information, and of a most communicative disposition. He
                    lived during the greater part of his life in the best society. An assembly of
                    literary characters met, during a long period of time, at his house every
                    Wednesday; and, during his latter years, he daily received persons of that
                    description. Much of his time was thus spent in conversation; and those of his
                    friends who habitually enjoyed it were at pains to record his opinions, which
                    were generally founded on a correct taste and judgment, and were always
                    delivered in a manner the most interesting and lively. A collection of his oral
                    opinions was published in 1693, soon after his death; and this collection, which
                    was entitled <hi rend="italic">Menagiana,</hi> was afterwards corrected and
                    enlarged by Μ. la Monnoye, in an edition published by him in 1715. Among the
                    most curious articles in the <hi rend="italic">Menagiana</hi> may be numbered
                    the dissertation on <hi rend="italic">Le Moyen de Parvenir,</hi> a work
                    attributed to Beroalde de Verreville; that on <hi rend="italic">Le Songe de
                    Poliphile;</hi> as also a letter of La Monnoye on the existence of a book
                    supposed to have been entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Tribus
                    Impostoribus,</hi> concerning which there has been much discussion and
                    controversy.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Perroniana,</hi> which exhibits the opinions of Cardinal
                    Perron, was composed from his familiar conversation by Μ. de Puy, and published
                    by Vossius, by the same contrivance which put him in possession of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scaligerana.</hi> Some parts of this collection are useful in
                    illustrating the literary and ecclesiastical history of the age in which Perron
                    lived; but it also contains many puerile, imprudent, and absurd remarks, which
                    it is generally supposed he never uttered, and many of which were proved by Μ.
                    Chevreau (<hi rend="italic">Chevroeana)</hi> to have been the interpolations of
                    his friends. Some of his assertions,—as that Luther denied the immortality of
                    the soul, and that every English peasant drinks from a silver goblet,—are
                    evidently false. Nor can much reliance be placed on the judgment or taste of an
                    author who has elsewhere declared that a page of Quintus Curtius is worth thirty
                    of Tacitus, and that, next to Quintus Curtius, Florus is the greatest Roman
                    historian. The <hi rend="italic">Thuana,</hi> or observations of the president
                    De Thou, have usually been published along with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perroniana.</hi> This collection is not extensive, and by no means of such
                    value as might have been expected from a man so able and distinguished.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Valesiana</hi> is a collection of the literary opinions of
                    the historiographer Adrian Valois, published by his son. Μ. Valois was a great
                    student of history, and the <hi rend="italic">Valesi-ana,</hi> accordingly,
                    comprehends many valuable historical observations, particularly on the works of
                    Du Cange.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Eureteriana</hi> contains the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bon-mots</hi> of Μ. Furetiere, of the French academy, the stories which he was
                    in the habit of telling, and a number of anecdotes and remarks found among his
                    papers after his decease. This production, however, consists chiefly of short
                    stories, and comprehends but few thoughts, opinions, or criticisms on books.
                    Furctiere, it is well known, had a violent quarrel with the French Academy, of
                    which he was a member, concerning his <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Universel
                    de la Langue Françoise.</hi> Having published a preliminary discourse, the
                    further printing was interdicted by the French Academy, which accused him of
                    purloining materials they had amassed for a similar work. This controversy
                    subsisted during the rest of the life of Furctiere, who spent his concluding
                    years in writing and publishing libels on his associates. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eureteriana,</hi> accordingly, is replete with allusions to a subject with
                    which his thoughts were so completely engrossed: in particular we find there the
                    plan and outline of an allegorical and burlesque poem, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Couches de l’Academic</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in which he
                    has satirized different members of the academy, especially Μ. Charpentier, one
                    of his bitterest foes, whom he has designated by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marmentier.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chevraeana,</hi> so called from Μ. Chevreau, exhibits more
                    research than most works of a similar description, and is probably more
                    accurate, as it was published during the life of the author, and revised by
                    himself. Among other interesting articles, it contains a learned and ingenious
                    commentary on the works of Malherbe, to whom the French language and poetry were
                    highly indebted for the perfection to which they attained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Parrhasiana</hi> is the work of Jean le Clerc, a professor of
                    Amsterdam, who bestowed this appellation on his miscellaneous productions with
                    the view of discussing various topics of philosophy and politics with more
                    freedom than he could have employed under his own name. This work is not of the
                    light and unconnected description of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038597"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8597-0676"/>most of the Ana which have been above enumerated,
                    as it contains much learned philological disquisition, and a long dissertation
                    on poetry and eloquence. In the first volume there is a list of his published
                    works, and a bitter reply to all those who had censured them.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Huetiana,</hi> which has always held a distinguished place
                    among the Ana, contains the detached thoughts and criticisms of Huet, bishop of
                    Avranches, which he himself committed to writing during his life. This author
                    was well fitted to produce a valuable work in this department of literature. He
                    enjoyed the friendship of a number of distinguished characters, and his reading
                    was various and extensive. This collection, however, was not begun by him till
                    he was far advanced in life. Huet was born in 1630, and in 1712 he was attacked
                    by a malady which impaired his memory, and rendered him incapable of the
                    sustained attention necessary for the completion of a long or laborious work. In
                    this situation he employed himself during the concluding years of his life in
                    throwing his detached observations on paper. These were published by the Abbé
                    d’Olivet the year after his death, under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Huetiana,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a work which is not, like some other
                    Ana, a succession of <hi rend="italic">bon-mots</hi> or anecdotes, but forms a
                    series of thoughts and criticisms on various topies of morals, philosophy, and
                    literature, and also comprehends pretty long dissertations on the origin of
                    rhyme, the comparative merit of the ancients and moderns, with similar topics.
                    One of the most instructive discussions to a scholar, in this collection, is
                    that on the Latinization of names and surnames; in which he points out and
                    criticises the different modes of this process. His critical judgments on
                    Montaigne, Rochefoucauld, and Taeitus, seem also well founded; and if some of
                    his opinions in matters of taste betray singular or defective feelings, there
                    are others which appear equally just and refined. But were there no other
                    literary memorials of the bishop of Avranches, he certainly would not derive
                    high reputation from the <hi rend="italic">Huetiana.</hi> D’Alembert has treated
                    this collection with contempt; and has selected some articles to show the
                    bishop’s incompetent judgment and frivolous taste. It may be suspected, indeed,
                    from the circumstances in which the articles contained in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Huetiana</hi> were composed, that they do not always display that correct
                    judgment which distinguishes many of the other works of this learned writer.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Casauboniana</hi> presents us with the miscellaneous
                    observations, chiefly philological, of the celebrated Isaac Casaubon. During the
                    course of a long life, that eminent commentator was in the daily practice of
                    committing to paper any thing remarkable which he heard in conversation with his
                    friends, especially if it bore on the studies in which he was engaged. He also
                    made diurnal annotations on the works he was employed in reading, with which he
                    connected his judgments concerning the author and his writings. This
                    compilation, which was styled <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides,</hi> together with
                    his <hi rend="italic">Adversaria,</hi> and materials amassed for a refutation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Annals of Earonius,</hi> came, at his
                    death, into the possession of his son Merie Casaubon, who bequeathed the whole
                    to the Bodleian library at Oxford. These were shown to Christopher Wolfius
                    during a visit which he paid to that university; and having been transcribed by
                    him, were published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Casauboniana.</hi> This
                    collection consists of opinions concerning various eminent writers,
                    illustrations of passages in Scripture, and philological observations and
                    animadversions on the first thirty-four years of the <hi rend="italic">Annals of
                    Baronius.</hi> The materials and information which it contains are probably more
                    accurate than is usually the case in works of the same description, as they were
                    not communicated in Casual conversation, and reported by others, but were daily
                    committed to writing by Casaubon himself, while the works from which they were
                    derived remained fresh in his recollection.</p>
                <p>Besides the above, a great many works, under the title of Ana, appeared in France
                    about the same period. Thus, the opinions and conversation of Charpentier,
                    Colomesius, and St Evremond, were recorded in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carpenteriana, Colomesiana,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">St Evremoniana</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and those of Segrais in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Segraisiana,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a collection formed by a person
                    stationed behind the tapestry in a house where Segrais was accustomed to visit,
                    and of which Voltaire has declared, “que de tous les Ana e’est eelui qui merite
                    le plus d’être mis au rang des mensonges imprimés, et surtout des mensonges
                    insipides.” The Ana, indeed, from the popularity which they now enjoyed, were
                    compiled in such numbers, and with so little care, that they became almost
                    proverbial for inaccuracy. About the middle of the eighteenth century they were
                    sometimes made the vehicles of political squibs, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maupeouana,</hi> and of heretical opinions, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Longueruana.</hi> Thus the evil naturally began to cure itself, and by a
                    re-action, which is very general in regard to all productions of literature, the
                    French Ana sunk in public esteem as much below their intrinsic value as they had
                    formerly been exalted above it.</p>
                <p>Although these conections have been chiefly formed from the oral opinions of
                    eminent men on the Continent, particularly in France, England has also produced
                    one or two examples of this species of composition, which are not altogether
                    undeserving of attention. Of these, perhaps the most curious is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Walpoliana,</hi> which is a transcript of the literary
                    conversation of Horace Walpole. That multifarious author was distinguished for
                    his resources of anecdote, wit, and judicious remark, as well as for his
                    epistolary qualifications. From his father, Sir Robert Walpole, he had learned
                    many anecdotes concerning the political characters who figured during the period
                    of his administration. He was himself personally acquainted with all the eminent
                    literary characters of his own day in England; and his repeated visits to Paris,
                    and constant correspondence with friends in that capital, supplied him with the
                    most interesting information with regard to France. A great part of his life was
                    devoted to conversation. While residing at Strawberry-hill, he generally rose
                    from table about five o’clock, and taking his place on his drawing-room sofa, to
                    which his gout in a great measure confined him, he passed the time, till two
                    o’clock in the morning, in miscellaneous chit-chat, full of singular anecdotes,
                    strokes of wit, and acute observations. As he possessed, and was daily
                    communicating, such stores of instruction and amusement, it was suggested to him
                    that he ought to form a collection of these anecdotes and observations. This he
                    declined, but he furnished the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Walpoliana</hi>
                    with many anecdotes in his own hand-writing. After his death, several specimens
                    of this miscellany were published in the <hi rend="italic">Monthly
                    Magazine,</hi> and being afterwards enlarged by anecdotes retained in the memory
                    of the editor, or communicated by others, were published in two volumes, under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Walpoliana,</hi> Most other works which, in this
                    country, have been published under the name of <hi rend="italic">Ana,</hi> as
                    <hi rend="italic">Baconiana, Atterburyana,</hi> are rather extracts from the
                    writings and correspondence of eminent men, than memorials of their
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>There are some works which, though they do not bear the title, belong more
                    strictly to the class of Ana than many of those collections which are known
                    under that appellation. Such are the <hi rend="italic">Mélange</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’</hi><hi rend="italic">Histoire et</hi><hi rend="italic">de

                    >—</hi> a work which was published as far back as the sixteenth century, and
                    has. obtained considerable reputation on account of its theological learning,
                    and the information it communicates concerning the early state of the reformed
                    church. But of those productions which belong to the class, though they do not
                    bear the name, of Ana, the most celebrated are the <hi rend="italic">Colloquia
                    Mensalia</hi> of Luther, and Selden’s <hi rend="italic">Table-Talk,</hi> both of
                    which merit particular notice. The first, which comprehends the conversation of
                    Luther with his friends and coadjutors in the great work of the Reformation, was
                    first published in 1566. Captain Henry Bell, who translated it into English in
                    the time of the Commonwealth, informs us that, at the instigation of the pope,
                    the emperor of Germany had promulgated an edict commanding the works of Luther
                    to be destroyed. It was for some time supposed that all the copies of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Colloquia Mensalia</hi> had been burned in consequence of this
                    order; but at length, in 1626, a German called Van Sparr, having occasion to
                    build on the old foundation of a house in which his grandfather dwelt when the
                    imperial edict was issued, he found lying in a deep hole, and wrapped up in a
                    linen cloth, a printed copy of the <hi rend="italic">Colloquia Mensalia.</hi>
                    Captain Bell having formerly become acquainted with Van Sparr during a long
                    residence in Germany, his friend transmitted the work to him in England, where
                    he executed a translation of it; an undertaking to which he pretends that he was
                    urged by the vision of an old man with a long white beard, arrayed in white, who
                    spoke these words: “Sirrah, will you not take time to translate that book ?” The
                    -extraordinary book translated by Bell, at the instance of this vision, is said
                    to have been originally collected by Dr Anthony Lauterbach, “out of the holy
                    mouth of Luther ;” and was afterwards digested into common-places by Dr John
                    Aurifaber. It chiefly contains observations and discussions on idolatry,
                    auricular confession, mass, excommunication, clerical jurisdiction, general
                    councils, and all the points agitated by the reformed church in those early
                    periods. With such topics there is intermixed many diatribes against Antichrist
                    and the Cardinals, and much sarcasm on popish miracles and relics. Occasionally,
                    however, it must be confessed that our great reformer expresses a belief in
                    superstitions fully as wild and monstrous as those which he derides, and which
                    he was called to overthrow. Thus, he asserted that he was repeatedly kept from
                    sleep by the devil cracking nuts in his chamber; and he affirmed that there was
                    a child at Dessau, which had been substituted by the arch-fiend instead of one
                    he had stolen away, and which child Luther earnestly advised the prince of
                    Anhalt to throw into the river Moldaw.</p>
                <p>If the collection of Selden’s apophthegms and sayings, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Table-Talk,</hi> be regarded of good authority, we shall find in it a more
                    genuine and undisguised expression of the sentiments of that eminent man, than
                    in his more studied productions. This work was published, after the death of
                    Selden, by Richard Milward, his amanuensis, who, in his dedication to Selden’s
                    executors, affirms that, for twenty years, he enjoyed the opportunity of daily
                    hearing his discourse, during which long period he made it his practice, from
                    time to time, faithfully to commit to writing “the excellent things that usually
                    fell from him.” Dr Wilkins, in his introductory discourse to the Works of
                    Selden, has attempted to throw discredit on the genuineness of this compilation,
                    asserting that it contains many things derogatory from Selden’s erudition, and
                    foreign from his manners and principles. It is not improbable, indeed, that the
                    memory of the amanuensis may have occasionally failed him, and that he may have
                    recorded sayings which inadvertently escaped his master in the heat of
                    conversation, and such as he probably would not have deliberately maintained.
                    But, on the whole, the work has completely an air of genuineness; and although
                    the familiarity of his illustrations and parallels may appear to clash with the
                    idea formed of so great a scholar, they are characteristic of a man who had been
                    conversant with scenes of common life, no less than the speculations of the
                    closet. That such was the usual manner of Selden’s conversation, the editor of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Table-Talk</hi> recalls to the recollection of those
                    friends of his patron to whom the work is dedicated; and this appeal forms a
                    presumption of his veracity. The <hi rend="italic">Table-Talk</hi> contains many
                    curious facts and opinions concerning the political and ecclesiastical history
                    of the interesting period during which Selden lived, and in the important events
                    of which he bore a considerable share. To judge from this work, Selden had great
                    contempt for the theologians of his day; and seems to have been of opinion that
                    the state should invariably keep a rein on the church. He was partial to the
                    Episcopal form of worship; but was evidently not very strict in doctrinal
                    points, as appears from what he is reported to have said on the subject of <hi
                    rend="italic">heresy.</hi> In his political opinions he seems to have
                    entertained a high respect for the sacredness of the social contract; and he
                    justified the resistance to the Stewarts, on the ground that they had infringed
                    and violated this compact between prince and people. Besides religious and
                    political opinions, the <hi rend="italic">Table-Talk</hi> contains much of a
                    lighter description; in consequence of which, Selden has been accused of showing
                    more laxness, in point of moral principle, than might have been expected from so
                    grave and respectable a character. Many of those sentiments, however, which have
                    been considered objectionable, may have been merely advanced as plausible
                    deductions from principles assumed for the sake of argument. But whatever
                    difference of opinion may exist with regard to the matter of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Table-Talk,</hi> the manner in which the sentiments are there
                    expressed must be universally admitted to be perspicuous and agreeable. The
                    style of Selden, in most of the works published under his own care, is harsh and
                    obscure; but Clarendon, who differed from him so widely in political opinions,
                    acknowledges that he was “a clear discourser, and that he possessed the faculty
                    of making difficult things easy, and presenting them clearly to the
                    understanding.” Accordingly, this talent for elucidation shines chiefly in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Table-Talk,</hi> which is filled with the stores of his
                    extensive reading, delivered without any pretensions to that order and method,
                    the want of which has been attributed to his other productions.</p>
                <p>It thus appears that, although the compilations designated by the name of Ana
                    belong more particularly to France, they have not been wholly unknown in this
                    country. In their <hi rend="italic">Motti e Burle,</hi> and sometimes in their
                    novels, the Italians also have recorded the witticisms of their distinguished
                    poets and artists. The novels of Sacchetti are full of repartees attributed to
                    Dante and the painters Giotto and Buffalmacco. Almost every Italian biographical
                    work of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, like Boswell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Johnson,</hi> records at great length the conversational
                    remarks of the individual whose life is detailed. Thus, Manso has dedicated one
                    of the books of his life of Torquato Tasso to an account of the wise and witty
                    sayings of that illustrious poet, who, towards the close of his days, had become
                    the intimate friend of his biographer. The conversation of the poet, however,
                    was neither gay nor brilliant. One of the characters in Goldoni<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193038623" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8623-0678"/>’s drama of Torquato Tasso
                    thus contrasts his writings and conversation:</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Ammiro il suo talento, gradisco i carmi suoi; </l>
                    <l part="N"> Ma piacer non trovo a conversar con lui. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>It also unfortunately happens that the greater part of the sayings recorded by
                    Manso may be found in the Apophthegms of Erasmus, which were published before
                    the birth of Tasso. Indeed Manso seems to have been aware of the want of
                    originality in the <hi rend="italic">bon-mots</hi> of his friend; for, after
                    mentioning one, he says, “questo motto fu da alcuni ad <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epiteto</hi> attribuito.” It was usual, indeed, among the biographers of those
                    times to pillage Xenophon or Plutarch for good things to put into the mouths of
                    their heroes; a practice from which Machiavel could not abstain in his short
                    account of the illiterate soldier Cas-truccio Castracani. In those ages of
                    pedantry, however, it is not improbable that many sayings of the old
                    philosophers might have been repeated as their own by the learned men of the
                    times; and that the Italian <hi rend="italic">literati</hi> might occasionally
                    attempt to make their hearers merry with the jests of Socrates or Diogenes. The
                    genius and character of the people rendered any collection of this nature less
                    agreeable than the Ana of the neighbouring nation. In Italy, gravity was
                    numbered among the virtues, and, in the eulogy of an illustrious man, is always
                    mentioned as one of his most commendable qualities. There seems, in that
                    country, to have been no medium between the most fantastic buffoonery and a
                    certain tragic solemnity. The Italians wanted that “mobility of imagination,”
                    that facility, rapidity, abandonment, and gaiety, which seems almost peculiar to
                    the French, and forms the chief charm of social intercourse, as well as of those
                    works in which it is represented; though, no doubt, when reduced into writing,
                    much of its grace and spirit must evaporate and disappear.</p>
                <p>The existence of similar causes, and perhaps in a stronger degree, prevented the
                    popularity of Ana among the Spaniards; though they too have related the jests
                    and opinions of the duke d’Ossuna, and of some others. Indeed, whatever may be
                    the genius or disposition of a people, traces of this mode of composition may in
                    some shape or other be discovered among them.</p>
                <p>When presented in their most perfect form, which is that of the French Ana, these
                    collections are certainly entertaining from their variety, and curious, as
                    presenting a lively image of the distinguished 'characters whose sentiments they
                    record. If men reason more correctly on paper, they usually display their
                    feelings and convictions with more truth in unpremeditated conversation. Few are
                    so cautious or hypocritical that they do not sometimes drop the mask in the
                    society of their friends, and express what they think or feel, when they no
                    longer entertain apprehensions that their sentiments will be communicated to the
                    vulgar. In general, however, the Ana should rather be regarded as affording a
                    notion of the spirit and turn of thinking of those whose conversation they
                    detail, than as authorities for particular opinions. A spirit of contradiction,
                    a wish to display ingenuity, to astonish by paradoxes, or even to support
                    conversation, may often lead men to maintain opinions in colloquial intercourse
                    which they perhaps never seriously held, or at least would be ready to disclaim
                    on mature consideration. It also unfortunately happens that, in many of the Ana,
                    those who collected the conversations which they presented to the world
                    interpolated their own opinions; which, of course, greatly diminishes their
                    authority as characteristical records. It has also been objected to this species
                    of composition, that every subject is treated superficially; but it should be
                    recollected that the Ana do not profess to contain profound dissertations; and
                    in fact no one consults them with the view of being deeply informed on any
                    topic. A better founded objection is, that many subjects are treated, not merely
                    superficially, but inaccurately. Such compositions are liable to a double risk
                    of error; first, of the person who delivers opinions in the heat of discourse,
                    or relates anecdotes from vague recollection; and, secondly, of the person who
                    records them, who must be liable to mistake what he has only heard in the course
                    of conversation. From these causes, and from their wide and general circulation,
                    many of the most current literary errors may be traced to the Ana. When read,
                    however, with discrimination, they may prove highly useful in illustrating
                    various points of literary history, as they certainly contain a great deal which
                    is not to be found in the formal compositions of the learned.</p>
                <p>Wolfius has given a history of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ana</hi> in a preliminary
                    discourse to his edition of the <hi rend="italic">Casauboniana,</hi> published
                    in 1710. In the <hi rend="italic">Repertoire de Bibliographies

                    there is a <hi rend="italic">Notice</hi><hi rend="italic">Bibliographique</hi>
                    of these collections; but many of the books there enumerated consist of mere
                    extracts from the writings of popular authors, and do not, therefore, belong to
                    that class of literary works described in the preceding article. <hi
