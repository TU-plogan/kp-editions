                <p><label type="entry">ADMIRALTY, <hi rend="smallcaps">High Court of</hi></label>.
                    This is a court of law, in which the authority of the lord high admiral is
                    exercised, in his <hi rend="italic">judicial</hi> capacity, and wherein all
                    causes are determined appertaining to the sea, and all offences tried that are
                    committed thereon. Very little has been left on record of the ancient
                    prerogative of the admirals of England. For some time after the first
                    institution of the office, they judged all matters relating to merchants and
                    mariners, which happened on the main sea, in a summary way, according to the
                    laws of Oleron, promulgated by Richard I. These laws, which were little more
                    than a transcript of the Rhodian laws, became the universally received customs
                    of the western part of the world. “All the sea-faring nations,” says Sir Leoline
                    Jenkins, “soon after their promulgation, received and entertained these laws
                    from the English, by way of deference to the sovereignty of our kings in the
                    British ocean, and to the judgment of our countrymen in sea affairs.”</p>
                <p>In the patents granted to the early admirals between the latter end of the reigii
                    of Henry III. and until the close of that of Edward III. no mention is made of
                    marine perquisites or of civil power, nor does it appear that the admirals
                    enjoyed either; but after the death of the latter, new and extraordinary powers
                    were granted to them, and it would appear that they usurped others. The preamble
                    to the statute of 13th Richard II. sets forth, that “forasmuch as a great and
                    common clamour and complaint hath been oftentimes made before this time, and yet
                    is, for that the admirals and their deputies hold their sessions within divers
                    places of this realm, accroaching to them greater authority than belongeth to
                    their office, in prejudice of our lord the king, and in destruction and
                    impoverishing of the common people and it is therefore directed that the
                    admirals and their deputies shall not meddle from henceforth of any thing done
                    within the realm, but only of a thing done upon the sea. And two years
                    afterwards, in consequence, as stated in the preamble of the statute, “of the
                    great and grievous complaint of all the commons,” it was ordained that the
                    admiral’s court should have no cognizance of any contracts, pleas, or quarrels,
                    or of any thing done or arising within the bodies of counties, whether by land
                    or by water, nor of wreck of the sea; but that the admiral should have
                    cognizance of the death of a man, and of maihern done in great ships being and
                    hovering in the main stream of great rivers, yet only beneath the bridges of the
                    same rivers nigh the sea. Ho may also arrest ships in the great floats for the
                    great voyages of the king and of the realm, and have jurisdiction over the said
                    floats, but during the said voyages only. But if the admiral or his lieutenant
                    exceed that jurisdiction, then, by 2d Henry IV., the statute of 13th Richard II.
                    and common law may be holden against them; and if a man pursues wrongfully in
                    the admiralty court, his adversary may recover double damages at common law, and
                    the pursuant, if attainted, shall incur the penalty of L.10 to the king.</p>
                <p>The place which, according to Spelman, is absolutely subject to the jurisdiction
                    of the admiral, is the sea; which, however, comprehends public rivers, fresh
                    waters, creeks, and all places whatsoever, within the ebbing and flowing of the
                    sea, at the highest water, the shores or banks adjoining, from all the first
                    bridges to the seaward; and in these, he observes, the admiralty hath full
                    jurisdiction in all causes, criminal and civil, except treasons and the right of
                    wreck. Lord Coke observes, that “between the high water mark and the low water
                    mark, the admiral hath jurisdiction <hi rend="italic">super</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aquam,</hi> when the sea is full, and as long as it flows, though
                    the land be <hi rend="italic">infra corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">comitatus</hi>
                    at the reflow, so as of one place there is <hi rend="italic">divisum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">imperium</hi> at several times.”</p>
                <p>But though the statute restraineth the lord high admiral, that he shall not hold
                    plea of a thing rising in the body of a county, he is not restrained from making
                    execution upon the land, but is empowered to take either body or goods upon the
                    land; otherwise his jurisdiction would often prove a dead letter. He also can
                    and does hold his court in the body of a county. So, likewise, the civil power
                    may apprehend and try persons who may have been guilty of offences cognizable at
                    common law, though committed in the fleet, in any port or harbour of Great
                    Britain, or at sea, provided such persons have not already been tried for such
                    offences, either by court-martial or in the admiralty court; and in all ports,
                    harbours, creeks, &amp;c. lying in any county, the high admiral and the sheriff,
                    or coroner, as the case may bc, have concurrent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>The Lord High Admiral is assisted in his <hi rend="italic">judicial</hi>
                    functions by the following principal officers :—1. The Vice-admiral; 2. the
                    Judge; 3. the Registrar; 4. the Marshal; 5. Advocate-general; 6.
                    Procurator-general; 7. Counsellor; 8. Solicitor.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Vice-admiral.</hi> This officer is the admiral’s deputy
                    or lieutenant, mentioned in the statutes of 13th and 15th Richard IL, and was
                    the person, most probably, who presided in the court. At present the office of
                    vice-admiral of England is a perfect sinecure, generally conferred on some naval
                    officer of high rank and distinguished character in the service, having a salary
                    attached to it in addition to his half-pay of L.469. 5s. 8d. <hi rend="italic"
                    >per annum.</hi> That of rear-admiral of England is the same, and the salary in
                    addition to his half-pay is L.370. 4s. 3d. <hi rend="italic">per annum.</hi>
                    Each county of England has its vice-admiral, which is little more than an
                    honorary distinction, though the patent gives to him all the powers vested in
                    the admiral himself. Similar powers were also granted to the judges of the
                    admiralty county-courts; but this was found so inconvenient and prejudicial to
                    those who had suits to commence or defend before them, that the duke of York,
                    when lord high admiral, in 1663, caused instructions to be drawn <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193031850" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1850-0157"/>up in order to ascertain to
                    each his province, whereby the whole judicial power remained with the judge, and
                    th¢ upholding of the rights of the admiral, and levying and receiving the
                    perquisites, &amp;c. appertained to the vice-admiral.</p>
                <p>Each of the four provinces of Ireland has its vice-admiral. There is one
                    vice-admiral for all Scotland, who has a salary of L.1000 a year on the ordinary
                    estimate of the navy; and one for the Shetland and Orkney islands, The governor
                    of most of our colonies has a commission of vice-admiral granted to him by the
                    lord high admiral or lords commissioners of the admiralty, and generally a
                    commission from the king, under the great seal, grounded on the 11th and 12th
                    William III., and further confirmed by 46th Geo. III., by which he is authorized
                    to try all piracies, felonies, or robberies committed on the seas, where the
                    parties are taken into custody in places remote from England; the court to
                    consist of seven persons at the least, of whom the governor, the
                    lieutenant-governor, the vice-admiral, the flag-officer, or commander-in-chief
                    of the squadron, the members of the council, the chief justice, judge of the
                    vice-admiralty court, captains of men of war, and secretary of the colony, are
                    specially named in the commission: but any three of these, with four others
                    selected from known merchants, factors, or planters, captains, lieutenants, or
                    warrant-officers of men of war, or captains, masters, or mates of merchant
                    ships, constitute a legal court of piracy.</p>
                <p>The vice-admiralty courts in the colonies are of two descriptions. The one has
                    power to inquire into the causes of detention of enemies or neutral vessels, to
                    try and condemn the same for the benefit of the captors, as well as to take
                    cognizance of all matters relating to the oiiice of the lord high admiral. The
                    other has power only to institute inquiries into misdemeanours committed in
                    merchant vessels, and to determine petty suits, &amp;c. and to guard the
                    privileges of the admiral. The former are usually known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Prize Courts,</hi> the latter by that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Instance Courts.</hi></p>
                <p>The following are the colonies and foreign possessions n which <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prize Courts</hi> have been established in the course of the last war
                    :—Gibraltar, Malta, Newfoundland, Halifax, Bermuda, Bahama Islands, Barbadoes,
                    Antigua, Tortola, Jamaica, Cape of Good Hope, Ceylon, Bombay, Madras, and
                    Calcutta. The following colonies had <hi rend="italic">Instance Courts</hi> only
                    :—Dominica, Grenada, St Vincent, St Christopher, Trinidad, St Cervix,
                    Martinique, Berbice, Demerara, and Essequibo; in addition to which is a court
                    established at Sierra Leone for the trial and condemnation of captured slaves
                    only.</p>
                <p>In none of the patents to the lord high admiral, vice-admiral, or judge, is any
                    mention made of prize jurisdiction. Lord Mansfield had occasion to search into
                    the records of the court of admiralty in Doctors’ Commons, to ascertain on what
                    foundation this jurisdiction was exercised by the judge of the admiralty; but he
                    could not discover any prize-act books farther back than 1643; no sentences
                    farther back than 1648. The registrar could go no farther back than 1690. “The
                    prior records,” says his lordship, “are in confusion, illegible, and without
                    index.” The prize jurisdiction may therefore be considered is of modern
                    authority, and distinct altogether from the ancient powers given to the admiral.
                    To constitute the authority for trying prize causes, a commission under the
                    great seal issues to the lord high admiral, at the commencement of every war, to
                    will and require the court of admiralty, and the lieutenant and judge of the
                    said court, liis surrogate or surrogates, to proceed upon all manner bf
                    captures, seizures, prizes, and reprisals, of all ships and goods that are or
                    shall be taken; and to hear and determine according to the course of the
                    admiralty, or the law of nations; and a warrant issues to the judge of the
                    admiralty accordingly.</p>
                <p>The admiralty court being in this respect a court in which foreigners of all
                    nations may become suitors, an appeal may be had from its decisions to a
                    committee of the lords of his Majesty’s privy council, who hear and determine
                    according to the established laws of nations.</p>
                <p>At the breaking out of a war, the lord high admiral also receives a special
                    commission from the crown, under the great seal, to empower him to grant letters
                    of marque and reprisals against the enemy, he having no such power by his
                    patent. These letters are either general or special; general, when granted to
                    private men to fit out ships at their own charge to annoy the enemy; special,
                    when in the case of any of our merchants being robbed of their estates or
                    property by foreigners, the king grants them letters of reprisal against that
                    nation, though we may be in amity with it. Before the latter can be sued for,
                    the complainant must have gone through the prosecution of his suit in the courts
                    of the state whose subjects have wronged him; where, if justice be denied or
                    vexatiously delayed, he must first make proof of his losses and charges in the
                    admiralty court here; whereupon, if the king is satisfied he has pursued all
                    lawful means to obtain redress, and his own interceding should produce no better
                    effect, special letters of reprisal are granted; not, however, as must be
                    evident, until a very strong case has been made out. This custom, which we may
                    now consider as obsolete, seems to be a remnant of the law of ancient Greece,
                    called <hi rend="italic">androlepsia,</hi> by which, if a man was slain, the
                    friends and relations of the deceased might seize on any three citizens of the
                    place where the murderer took refuge, and make them slaves, unless he was
                    delivered up. Both Oliver Cromwell and King Charles II. granted letters of
                    reprisal. In 1638 the Due d’Epernon seized on the ship Amity of London, for the
                    service of the French king against the Spaniards, promising full satisfaction;
                    but none being made, the owners obtained letters of reprisal from the usurper,
                    and afterwards, in 1665, from Charles II. In 1666 Captain Butler Barnes had
                    letters of reprisal against the Danes. The Dutch having burnt six English
                    merchant vessels in the Elbe, within the territories of Hamburg, which city,
                    instead of giving any assistance or protection, hindered the English from
                    defending themselves, letters of reprisal were granted to the sufferers against
                    that city. Lastly, one Justiniani, a noble Genoese, being indebted in a great
                    sum to Joseph Como, a merchant in London, which he had several years solicited
                    for, but could get no satisfaction, Captain Scott, commander of his Majesty’s
                    ship the Dragon, stationed at that time in the Mediterranean, received orders to
                    make reprisals upon the ships of that republic; upon which the debt was
                    paid.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Judge.</hi> The patents to the judge of the admiralty
                    and vice-admiralty courts run pretty nearly in the same manner as those of the
                    lord high admiral, and point out the several matters of which he can take
                    cognizance. The parliament of 1640 established the office of judge of the
                    admiralty court in three persons, with a salary of L.500 a year to each. At the
                    Restoration there were two judges of the high court of admiralty, which
                    sometimes proved inconvenient; for when they differed in opinion no judgment
                    could be had. These judges, before the Revolution, held their appointment only
                    during pleasure. At that period Sir Charles Hedges was constituted judge under
                    the great seal of England, <hi rend="italic">quamdiu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >se</hi><hi rend="italic">bene</hi><hi rend="italic">gesserit,</hi> with a
                    salary of L.400 a year, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031863"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1863-0158"/>an additional L.400 out of the proceeds of prizes
                    and perquisites of the admiralty; but in the year 1725 the latter sum was
                    diminished from the ordinary estimate by the House of Commons. Lord Stowell, the
                    late judge, in consequence of the extraordinary increase of the business in the
                    admiralty court, had a salary of L.2500 a year on the ordinary estimate of the
                    navy.</p>
                <p>The judges of the vice-admiralty courts in certain of the colonies, limited by
                    41st George III., are allowed a salary not exceeding to each the sum of L.2000 a
                    year, to be paid out of the consolidated fund of Great Britain; together with
                    profits and emoluments not exceeding to each the further sum of L.2000 <hi
                    rend="italic">per annum,</hi> out of the fees to be taken by the said judges, of
                    which a table is directed to be hung up in some conspicuous place in the court;
                    and no judge is to take any fee beyond those specified, directly or indirectly,
                    on pain of forfeiture of his office, and being proceeded against for extortion;
                    and on his retirement from office, after six years’ service, his Majesty may, by
                    authority of the act above mentioned, grant unto such judge an annuity for the
                    term of his life, not exceeding L.1000 <hi rend="italic">per aìinum.</hi> This
                    liberal provision puts the judges of the colonial courts of vice-admiralty above
                    all suspicion of their decisions being influenced by unworthy motives; a
                    suspicion they were not entirely free from when their emoluments depended mainly
                    on their fees.</p>
                <p>During the late war, a session of oyer and terminer to try admiralty causes was
                    held at the Old Bailey twice a year. The commission for this purpose is of the
                    same nature with those which are granted to the judges when they go the
                    circuits; that is to say, to determine and punish all crimes, offences,
                    misdemeanours, and abuses; the <hi rend="italic">and</hi> of both being the
                    same, their <hi rend="italic">limits</hi> different; the one relating to things
                    done upon the land, the other to things done upon the water. The lords
                    commissioners of the admiralty, all the members of the privy council, the
                    chancellor and all the judges, the lords of the treasury, the secretary of the
                    admiralty, the treasurer and commissioners of the navy, some of the aldermen of
                    London, and several doctors of the civil law, are the members of this
                    commission; any four of whom make a court, the quorum .being the lords of the
                    admiralty, judge of the admiralty, the twelve judges, and the doctors of the
                    civil law.</p>
                <p>The session of oyer and terminer lasts generally from ope to three days, and the
                    court is entertained each day with a dinner at the expense of the lord high
                    admiral, that is to say, of the public.</p>
                <p>The proceedings of the court are continued <hi rend="italic">de die in diem,</hi>
                    or, as the style of the court is, from tide to tide.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Registrar of the Admiralty</hi> has hitherto held his
                    place by patent from the lord high admiral generally for life, though the
                    admiral himself and the lords commissioners of admiralty hold their places only
                    during pleasure; and, what is still more remarkable, the office of registrar has
                    sometimes been granted, and is now vested in reversion. He had no salary, the
                    amount of his emoluments depending on the number of captures, droits, &amp;c.
                    condemned by the court; which, during the late war, were so enormous, that in
                    1810 an act was passed for regulating the offices of registrars of admiralty and
                    prize courts, by which it is enacted, “that no office of registrar of the high
                    court of admiralty, or of the high court of appeals for prizes, or high court of
                    delegates in Great Britain, shall, after the expiration of the interest now
                    vested in possession or reversion therein, be granted for a longer term than
                    during pleasure, nor be executed by deputy; that an account be kept in the said
                    offices respectively of all the fees, dues, perquisites, emoluments, and profits
                    received by and on account of the said registrars, out of which all the expenses
                    of their offices are to be paid; that one-third of the surplus shall belong to
                    the registrar and to his assistant (if an assistant should be necessary), and
                    the remaining two-thirds to the consolidated fund of Great Britain, to be paid
                    quarterly into the exchequer; the account of such surplus to be presented to the
                    court at least fourteen days before each quarter day, and. verified on oath.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Marshak</hi> This officer receives his appointment from
                    the lord high admiral or lords, commissioners of the admiralty, and holds his
                    situation by patent under the seal of the high court of admiralty during
                    pleasure. His duties are, to arrest ships and persons, to imprison in the
                    Marshalsea, to bear the mace before the judge, and to attend executions. His
                    emoluments depend chiefly on the number of prizes brought into port for
                    condemnation, and the number of ships embargoed, and may probably be reckoned in
                    time of war, <hi rend="italic">communibus annis,</hi> from L.1500 to L.2000 a
                    year, out of which he has to pay about L.400 a year to a deputy. In peace, the
                    whole emoluments are probably not sufficient for the payment of the deputy’s
                    salary.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Advocate-general.</hi> This officer is appointed by
                    warrant of the lords commissioners of the admiralty. His duties are, to appear
                    for the lord high admiral in his court of admiralty, court of delegates, and
                    other courts; to move and debate in all causes wherein the rights of the admiral
                    are concerned; for which he had anciently a salary of twenty marks a year, and
                    an additional allowance, granted to him in 1695, of L.200 a year. At present he
                    has L.213. 6s. 8d. a year, voted on the ordinary estimate of the navy. Formerly
                    the admiral’s advocate was always retained as leading counsel, but since the
                    droits were transferred to the crown, he has gradually been supplanted by the
                    king’s advocate, who is generally retained in all eases, the admiralty advocate
                    acting only as junior counsel; and while the former makes sometimes from
                    L.15,000 to L.20,000 a year, the latter rarely receives from his professional
                    duties more than from L.1500 to L.2000 a year. This difference, however, may
                    probably be owing in a great degree to the personal character of the men who
                    hold the two situations.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Procurator.</hi> The admiralty’s proctor stands
                    precisely in the same situation to the king’s proctor that his advocate does to
                    that of the king, though there is not quite so great a difference in their
                    emoluments. They act as the attorneys or solicitors in all causes concerning the
                    king’s and the lord high admiral’s affairs in the high court of admiralty and
                    other courts. All prize causes are conducted by the king’s proctor, which the
                    captors are disposed to consider as a grievance, but which the gentlemen of
                    Doctors Commons, on the contrary, maintain to be for their convenience and
                    advantage. It is supposed that in some years of the war the king’s proctor did
                    not receive less than L.20,000 a year.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">The Counsel of the Admiralty</hi> is the law officer who is
                    chiefly consulted on matters connected with the military duties of the lord high
                    admiral; his salary is L.100 a year, besides his fees, which in time of war may
                    be reckoned to amount to from L.1200 to L.1800 a year.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">The Solicitor to the Admiralty</hi> is also an officer more
                    immediately connected with the military functions of the admiralty. He is styled
                    sometimes assistant to the counsel: his salary is L.1500 a year, in lieu of all
                    fees, bills, and disbursements.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Judge Advocate</hi> of the fleet is a sinecure appointment,

                    Vancouver in 1792, who found the soil on the shores rich and fertile, well
                    watered, and clothed with luxuriant vegetation.</p>

                    about Long. 146. 44. E. and Lat. 2. 18. S. There are between 20 and 30 islands
                    said to be scattered about here, one of which alone would make a large kingdom.
                    Captain Carteret, who first discovered them, was prevented from touching at
                    them, although their appearance was very inviting, on account of the condition
                    of his ship, and his being entirely unprovided with the articles of barter which
                    suit an Indian trade. He describes them as clothed with a beautiful verdure of
                    woods, lofty and luxuriant, interspersed with spots that have been cleared for
                    plantations, groves of cocoa-nut trecs, and houses of the natives, who seem to
                    be very numerous. The largest of these islands is 18 leagues long in the
                    direction of east and west. The discoverer thinks it highly probable that these
                    islands produce several valuable articles of trade, particularly spices, as they
                    lie in the same climate and latitude as the Moluccas.</p>
