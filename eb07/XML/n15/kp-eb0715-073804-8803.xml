                <p><label type="entry">NATURAL HISTORY</label>. The objects of nature may be
                    considered under two points of view; first, with respect to their form,
                    structure, habits, and individual properties, when viewed in a state of
                    inactivity; and secondly, with respect to the mutual changes which they produce
                    when made to act upon each other. Hence the study of nature may be divided into
                    two parts, namely, Natural History and Natural Science; the former considering
                    bodies in comparatively an inactive state, and the latter in a state of mutual
                    action.</p>
                <p>Natural History, then, is that part of natural knowledge which teaches us to
                    distinguish and describe the objects of nature; to examine their appearance,
                    structure, properties, and uses; and to collect, preserve, and arrange
                    them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some writers
                    divide natural history into <hi rend="italic">general</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >particular,</hi> which have been accurately defined by Cuvier. <hi
                    rend="italic">General natural history</hi> considers, under a single point of
                    view, all natural bodies, and the common result of all their actions in the
                    great whole of nature. It determines the laws of the co-existence of their
                    properties; it establishes the degrees of resemblance which exist between
                    different bodies; and it classes them according to these degrees. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Particular natural history</hi> of any body, to be perfect, should
                    comprehend, first, the description of all the sensible properties of that body,
                    and of all its parts; secondly, the mutual relations of these parts, the motions
                    which they produce, and the changes which they undergo whilst they remain
                    united; thirdly, the active and passive relations of this body with every other
                    body in the universe; and, fourthly, the explanation of all these phenomena.

                    Naturelle.}</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>I. When we take a general survey of the objects with which we are surrounded, we
                    are bewildered amidst the number and the variety which are everywhere presented
                    to our view. The air, the woods, the fields, and the waters, teem with myriads
                    of animals; a large proportion of the earth’s surface is covered with a green
                    mantle of luxuriant herbage, interspersed with plants and flowers of a thousand
                    varied tints; and when we search below this, or when we explore the cloud-capt
                    mountain, the gloomy mine, the sequestered cavern, or the rocky cliff, we
                    discover a great variety of mineral substances, either piled into irregular
                    masses, or lying in uniform beds or layers, disposed in veins or seams, or
                    scattered at random through the other stony matters.</p>
                <p>To the casual observer, the number and variety of these objects would appear
                    almost infinite, and he would consider it as impossible to enumerate them as to
                    number the stars or count the sands on the sea-shore. This idea, however, arises
                    from his seeing them lying in confusion and disorder. The naturalist, by
                    separating them into those groups or classes in which they often naturally
                    present themselves, has succeeded not only in distinguishing the several kinds
                    from each other, but even in guessing pretty accurately at the number of species
                    which have hitherto been discovered. In fact, there are two objects which should
                    principally occupy the attention of the naturalist; first, to classify natural
                    substances; secondly, to examine their structure.</p>
                <p>The number of natural productions being confessedly very great, it is necessary
                    to find out some means of distinguishing them from each other, and of
                    recognising them on seeing them anew. These means are the peculiarities, or the
                    assemblages of peculiarities, which belong exclusively to each body. Now there
                    is scarcely any substance which has a simple character, that is, which can be
                    distinguished from every other substance by any one of its properties singly. It
                    is only by the combination of several of these properties that we can
                    distinguish an object from others which resemble it in possessing some one or
                    more of those very properties; and the more numerous the species we compare, the
                    more necessary it becomes to bring their properties together, in order to assign
                    to each a character that may distinguish it from the rest. Hence, to distinguish
                    a species, considered independently of all others that exist in nature, it is
                    necessary to express in its character almost the whole of its properties; and
                    the greater the number of these we take into the character, the more complete
                    will be our description of the object. But no man can acquire a sufficiently
                    accurate knowledge of all natural objects to enable him to give a complete
                    description of them. Human life is too short to admit of the completion of such
                    a task. All that can be expected from our limited faculties, is to acquire a
                    general knowledge of natural objects, confining our principal attention to such
                    as possess some striking qualities, or appear convertible to the useful purposes
                    of life.</p>
                <p>To attain this end, two modes of procedure have been adopted by naturalists.
                    According to the first mode, characters are employed which rise by degrees from
                    particulars to generals. They begin by comparing together a certain number of
                    species which bear the nearest relation to each other. In drawing the characters
                    of these species, it is requisite to express only those differences which, on a
                    supposition that they are the most nearly related, form but a small part of
                    their properties; and a number of species thus brought together constitutes what
                    is denominated a <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tribe.</hi></p>
                <p>The remainder of those properties which are common to all the species of the
                    genus combine to form the character, or rather the description, of the genus,
                    distinguishing it from all those which might be formed by bringing together
                    other species; but the number of such common properties being still very
                    considerable, the same means <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828816"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8816-0739"/>are repeated, in order to reduce the characters of
                    the <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> to smaller terms. We compare together only
                    those genera which most nearly resemble each other; and the generic characters
                    now employed must only express those differences which form but a small part of
                    their common properties. The properties which are common to all the genera
                    compose a character which distinguishes this assemblage or group from all other
                    groups of genera. Such an assemblage of genera is called an <hi rend="italic"
                    >order.</hi></p>
                <p>Repeating the same operation, and bringing together such orders as are most
                    nearly allied, we form a more general assemblage, called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >class</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and again uniting a certain number of
                    classes, we form a higher division, to which naturalists have given the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Kingdom.</hi> This chain of divisions, in which the higher
                    links comprehend the lower, forms what is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >method.</hi></p>
                <p>The other mode of procedure is to proceed gradually from generals to particulars,
                    beginning with the slightest and most obvious differences, thus forming the
                    first division or kingdom; dividing each kingdom into classes, each class into
                    orders, each order into genera, each genus into species, and each species into
                    varieties. This descending series constitutes what is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >system,</hi> and is that which has been generally adopted by naturalists.</p>
                <p>In order to illustrate this systematical classification of natural objects, let
                    us select a familiar example. Amongst the various creatures which pass under our
                    observation, a great number are possessed of life, of sensation, and voluntary
                    motion. These we call <hi rend="italic">animals,</hi> and of them we form the
                    <hi rend="italic">animal kingdom.</hi> On examining various groups of animals,
                    we find that many have four extremities, and suckle their young by means of
                    teats, and these we call <hi rend="italic">quadrupeds</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >mammalia,</hi> thus forming a <hi rend="italic">class of animals.</hi> Again we
                    find, that of the mammalia some have hoofed feet and blunt fore-teeth, and feed
                    almost entirely on vegetables. These constitute an order of the class of
                    mammalia, to which Linnaeus has given the name of <hi rend="italic">belluae.
                    Of</hi> this order a certain number of animals agree in having six fore-teeth in
                    both jaws, and form a genus or tribe distinguished by this particular from the
                    other animals of the same order, and commonly called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >horse</hi> tribe. Lastly, in this tribe we find one species which has solid
                    hoofs, a tail bristly at the end, an upright mane, and a black cross on the
                    shoulder of the male. This species is the common <hi rend="italic">ass.</hi></p>
                <p>In framing an artificial system of natural history, most writers have agreed on
                    the division of natural bodies into kingdoms, proceeding on the supposition that
                    those marks which are to distinguish the objects of one kingdom from those of
                    another are sufficiently fixed and certain. Let us examine for a little how far
                    this supposition agrees with nature’s works as we find them.</p>
                <p>The division of natural objects commonly adopted is into three kingdoms; the
                    animal, vegetable, and mineral. This division has been almost universally
                    received as perfectly consistent with nature, and is by most persons conceived
                    to be so clear and distinct, that they suppose it impossible to mistake in
                    referring any particular object to its proper kingdom. This arises from their
                    having noticed only such objects as bear evident marks of the division to which
                    they belong; but if we draw their attention to a variety of other individuals,
                    they will acknowledge themselves to be incompetent to the decision, or will
                    erroneously refer to one division, what has, after accurate examination, been
                    determined to belong to another.</p>
                <p>There is one whole class of productions, called <hi rend="italic">zoophytes</hi>
                    by naturalists, which appear to form the connecting links between the different
                    kingdoms. They are animals of the polypus kind, mostly covered with a calcareous
                    crust, differing little in composition from the shells of lobsters, shrimps, and
                    other shell-fish, and formed, like them, from an exudation or secretion on the
                    surface of their bodies.</p>
                <p>These polypi are connected together by thousands, or even millions, and assume a
                    great variety of appearances, according to their arrangement; the same species,
                    however, always assuming the same, or very nearly the same, appearance. Some are
                    connected together in the form of stem and branches, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fiustrae, sertulariae, corallines,</hi> and others, many of which have their
                    offspring in the egg state attached to them, and so situated as to bear exact
                    resemblance to the seed-vessels of plants. These are altogether so like to many
                    of the sea-plants, as to be generally confounded with them under the title of
                    sea-weeds; but the attentive observer may, by examining them in their natural
                    state, perceive the tentacula or feelers of each polypus extended in its search
                    for food, and hastily retracting within its shell upon the least alarm. Many of
                    this description are found attached to oysters or other shell-fish, and often to
                    stones and pebbles which are covered or occasionally wetted by the sea.</p>
                <p>Other zoophytes assume less regular figures, and are much more firm and solid,
                    resembling the productions of the mineral kingdom. Madrepores and millepores,
                    called often <hi rend="italic">brainstones,</hi> are of this kind. At first
                    sight they look very like stones and pebbles, or like pieces of chalk or marble;
                    but on an accurate inspection, any one may perceive marks of an organic
                    structure, and, when they are in a recent state, may detect the inhabitants of
                    their numerous cells.</p>
                <p>The above examples will perhaps suffice to prove how insufficient is either
                    a'hasty examination, or the judging by similarity of appearance, for determining
                    to what kingdom of nature any particular object belongs. But there are many
                    other productions to which few persons could, without hesitation, assign their
                    places. For instance, where would we arrange the green powdery substance so
                    common on paling; the spotted and streaked appearance on stones; the mould on
                    cheese, or the green jelly-like matter which floats on the surface of the
                    stagnant waters? Naturalists in general have assigned these productions to the
                    vegetable kingdom; but Sennebier and a few others have maintained that some of
                    them are animals.</p>
                <p>According to some writers, the most philosophical notion which we can form on
                    this subject is, that the division of natural objects into kingdoms is
                    artificial, and that nature, acknowledging no such bonds, passes imperceptibly
                    from the animal to the vegetable, and from the vegetable to the mineral world,
                    without defining where the one ceases or where the next begins.</p>
                <p>As the appearances of natural productions are insufficient, so are their
                    properties and powers, for determining which are animals or which vegetables,
                    according to the received acceptation of the terms. If locomotion is allowed to
                    be the characteristic of an animal, where shall we place the oyster, or the
                    zoophytes of which we have just been speaking, or where some species of <hi
                    rend="italic">ulva</hi> and <hi rend="italic">conferva,</hi> plants that swim
                    about detached in water? If feeling or sensation be the test, who shall decide
                    that the sensitive plant <hi rend="italic">(mimosa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pudica)</hi> possesses it not? and who determine that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >leaves of</hi> the fly-trap <hi rend="italic">(dionaea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >muscipula),</hi> when they contract, and catch the fly as soon as it alights,
                    do not feel the despoiler that comes to rob it of its honey? Though these and
                    similar objections may certainly be made to the artificial division of nature’s
                    works into kingdoms, yet it is convenient to have such a division; and even the
                    very difficulty of establishing to which kingdom any object belongs is an
                    additional spur to the genius and industry of the naturalist.</p>
                <p>The most natural division of the works of nature is that which distinguishes them
                    into <hi rend="italic">organized</hi> and <hi rend="italic">inorganic</hi>
                    bodies; and, on the whole, we have seen no attempt to establish the differences
                    between these so successful as that adopted by Μ. Dumeril in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Traité Elémentaire</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193828829"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8829-0740"/><hi rend="italic">(THistoire Naturelle.</hi> “Some
                    objects,” says he, “as animals and plants, have formerly constituted a part of
                    other individuals, similar to themselves, from which they have been separated at
                    a certain period, under the form of eggs, of germs, or of little living
                    creatures; and their existence is evidently owing to this generation; they are
                    <hi rend="italic">born.</hi> Others, on the contrary, as stones, salts, water,
                    may be formed by certain circumstances, and even by ourselves at pleasure. They
                    have not necessarily made a part of other similar bodies; their existence seems
                    to depend on certain fortuitous circumstances, that have produced the
                    approximation of their constituent principles, and their origin might be
                    referred to attraction. These bodies are <hi rend="italic">formed.</hi>
                    Vegetables and animals, in increasing their size, only develope themselves.
                    Whatever may be their minuteness, we shall, on a careful examination, find them
                    already formed, with their parts requiring only to be evolved. Their increase
                    proceeds from within outwards, by <hi rend="italic">intussusception.</hi>
                    Stones, and a great many other bodies, are augmented only by the same matter
                    from which they are produced; their growth takes place always from without, by a
                    sort of aggregation.</p>
                <p>“As the increase of the bodies which compose these two great subdivisions is not
                    alike in both, a duration very different ought to be the result of these
                    dissimilarities. In fact, minerals are susceptible of indefinite increase, and
                    their end is always indeterminate; it is vague, and depends on the circumstances
                    under which they are placed. Plants and animals ought, from the same
                    circumstances which favoured their development, to stop when their extension has
                    been carried to the highest degree, so that the end or death of these bodies is
                    fixed and necessary.</p>
                <p>“The masses in which stones and other similar bodies generally present themselves
                    are angular, insulated, and very variable in their size. The individuals which
                    we call plants and animals have always, and necessarily, a form that is
                    constant, for the most part rounded and symmetrical, and their extension is
                    limited within certain bounds.</p>
                <p>“There is this great difference between these bodies, that those which increase
                    by aggregation may be divided into molecules, or parts infinitely small, bearing
                    a very near resemblance to the mass from which they were taken; while in those
                    which develope themselves, no portion can be taken away and exist by itself, at
                    least unless it develope new parts, which replace those that are wanting.</p>
                <p>“The bodies which do not develope themselves are in general formed of fluids or
                    solids which remain constantly in the same points; they are composed of very few
                    elements, which may be separated and again reunited. The bodies which develope
                    themselves, on the contrary, are essentially composed of solids and fluids,
                    which are always changing, and in a state of renovation; they have always, and
                    from necessity, more or less consistence; they are penetrated and augmented by
                    fluids; and after being decomposed, they can never be formed again such as they
                    were before.”</p>
                <p>For the more convenient study of natural history, the whole subject may be
                    divided into five great branches, namely, meteorology, hydrography,
                    mineralogy,botany, and zoology. Meteorology includes the description of all
                    those phenomena which take place in the atmosphere that surrounds the
                    terrestrial globe. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology.</hi>
                    Hydrography comprehends the natural history of the sea, of rivers, lakes, and
                    other collections of water that make up so large a part of the earth. See the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Physical Geography.</hi> Mineralogy is that part of
                    the subject which treats of the solid inorganic bodies that are found on the
                    surface or in the bowels of the earth. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mineralogy.</hi> Botany comprehends the natural history of vegetables. See the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Botany.</hi> And zoology includes the natural
                    history of all animated beings, and is subdivided into many subordinate classes.
                    The classification followed in this work is fully explained in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Animal,</hi> where also the reader will find a view of all the
                    other systems.</p>
                <p>It is not surprising that naturalists of taste and genius, observing the
                    gradation which seems to take place amongst the works of nature, should have
                    been led to form the notion that there exists a regular series or chain of
                    beings, the links of which, if we could discover them all, would be found to
                    resemble each other so nearly, as only to exhibit to the superficial observer a
                    few shades of difference. <hi rend="italic">Natura</hi><hi rend="italic">non
                    per</hi><hi rend="italic">saltum movet,</hi> has become a sort of axiom in
                    natural history.</p>
                <p>The notion of a chain of being is alluring, and does not want arguments in its
                    favour. The Esquimaux Indian, or the inhabitant of Terra del Fuego, seems
                    scarcely superior in form, and very little in intellect, to the oran-utang; the
                    <hi rend="italic">platypus,</hi> the flying <hi rend="italic">lemur,</hi> flying
                    squirrels, and, still more, the bats, appear to form the connecting links
                    between quadrupeds and birds; while the seals, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >walrusses,</hi> and the whole order of <hi rend="italic">cete,</hi> connect the
                    former with the fishes. In this latter class, the flying fish, in its capability
                    of supporting itself in the air, seems to approach the feathered tribes; while
                    some of these, as the penguins, in their habits and manner of life bear some
                    distant resemblance to fishes. Again, the siren and the eels so nearly resemble
                    each other, that it has been disputed whether the former should be reckoned
                    among the <hi rend="italic">amphibia</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fishes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whilst one species of lizard <hi
                    rend="italic">(lacerta</hi><hi rend="italic">lumbricodes)</hi> is so like an
                    earthworm, as apparently to connect the <hi rend="italic">amphibia</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">vermes.</hi> Farther, the diminutive humming-bird <hi
                    rend="italic">(trochilus exilis)</hi> and the humble-bee <hi rend="italic"
                    >(apis</hi><hi rend="italic">terrestris)</hi> are so nearly alike, both in size
                    and manner of life, as to form no very exceptionable links of union between the
                    birds and the insects.</p>
                <p>If, again, we compare the vegetable tribes with some of the inferior classes of
                    animals, we shall perceive many points of resemblance, which may seem to
                    indicate a continuance of the same chain. Besides the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mimosa</hi><hi rend="italic">pudica</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dionaea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">muscipula,</hi> already mentioned, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hedysarum</hi><hi rend="italic">gyrans</hi> or moving plant is a remarkable
                    instance of the mobility of vegetables; the carrion flower <hi rend="italic"
                    >(stapelia</hi><hi rend="italic">hirsuta),</hi> and some species of <hi
                    rend="italic">morel,</hi> bear the odour of putrid animal substances; while, on
                    the other hand, the <hi rend="italic">mantis siccifolia</hi> might be mistaken
                    for a dried leaf; several species of <hi rend="italic">pennatula</hi> (sea pens)
                    and <hi rend="italic">sertularia,</hi> for ferns; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >madrepora fun-gites</hi> (mushroom madrepore), for a petrified mushroom; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">tubularia magnifica</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >actiniae,</hi> when expanded, for the most beautiful full-blown flowers.</p>
                <p>Lastly, on comparing the mineral kingdom with the classes of organized beings, we
                    find several so nearly resembling stones, as scarcely to be distinguished from
                    them.</p>
                <p>But although the view which we have given above, of the circumstances that have
                    led naturalists to form the idea of a regular chain of beings, is specious, it
                    will not bear the scrutiny of a strict examination. The resemblances which we
                    have pointed out are more apparent than real; and anatomy and chemistry, added
                    to a more accurate acquaintance with the works of nature, have proved that those
                    links which, to superficial observers, appear most allied, arc yet separated by
                    considerable chasms. In fact, if we were to admit these resemblances as ever so
                    accurate, they would lead us to form, not one chain, but many.</p>
