                <p><label type="entry">NAPLOUS</label>, the ancient Sechem, a populous and
                    flourishing city of Palestine, and the chief city of the Samaritans. In the time
                    of Vespasian it was called Neapolis, or the New City; and it is mentioned by
                    Pliny and by Josephus under the name of Neapolis. It continued long afterwards
                    to be known chiefly by its Greek name, which has now been changed to that of
                    Nablous or Naplous. It is situated in a long valley, which, according to the
                    accounts both of Dr Clarke and Mr Buckingham, is beautiful, being covered with
                    woods of olives, corn-fields, reservoirs of water, gardens, aqueducts in
                    different directions, and all the marks of industry, opulence, and abundance. It
                    is situated between the two hills of Gerizim on the south, and Ebal on the
                    north, and completely fills up the intermediate valley, so that there is no room
                    for its extension in breadth. The town consists of two long streets running
                    nearly east and west through the centre of the valley, and these intersected by
                    smaller ones mostly crossing at right angles. The town contains six mosques,
                    five baths, a Greek church, an excellent covered bazaar for fine goods, and an
                    open one for provisions; besides numerous cotton cloth manufactories, and shops
                    of every description. One of the mosques, built within the precincts of a ruined
                    church of St Helena, presents on its eastern front, which is still perfect, a
                    fine pointed arch, supported by Corinthian columns. The inhabitants are mostly
                    employed in the manufacture of soap; but the other products supply a very widely
                    extended neighbourhood, and are carried by caravans to Egypt and Damascus, and
                    to the rest of the neighbouring countries. Several relics of antiquity are here
                    exhibited. Amongst these may be mentioned the tombs of Joseph and of Joshua,
                    which are, as usual, hewn in the solid rock, and are thus calculated to endure.
                    There is little doubt amongst the learned as to the identity of these relics.
                    About three miles on the road to Jerusalem is a spot called Jacob’s Well, to
                    which still greater reverence is attached by the inhabitants, as the place where
                    our Saviour conversed with the woman of Samaria. The resident population of
                    Naplous has been estimated at 10,000, though Mr Buckingham seems to think this
                    estimate somewhat high. They are almost all Mahommedans, the few Greek
                    Christians scarcely amounting to fifty. The town is governed by a mutezellim, or
                    magistrate, subject to Damascus; and he has at present about 402 Arnaut
                    soldiers. The dress of the men is partly Turkish and partly Arabic, more nearly
                    approaching to the former than the latter. The faces of the women are covered
                    with a coloured veil, as in the towns of Yemen; they also wear a scarf of a
                    yellowish white, with a deep red border, which is thrown over the head and
                    shoulders. No Jews are permanent residents in this place. It is twenty·four
                    miles north of Jerusalem. Long. 35. 22. E. Lat. 32. 16. N.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Napoleon Buonaparte</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bonaparte</hi> was born at Ajaccio, in Corsica, on the 15th of August, in 1769.
                    He was descended of a patrician family, which had been of some note in Italy
                    during the middle ages; and one of his ancestors, the gonfaloniere Buonaparte of
                    Saint Nicoas, had governed the republic of Florence about the middle of the
                    thirteenth century. But to this fortuitous circumstance he himself attached no
                    importance whatever. A captain who had rendered his country illustrious, and by
                    his own merit re-established the throne of Charlemagne, had little need of
                    ancestry. “I am the Rodalph of my race,” said he; “my patent dates from
                    Montenotte.”</p>
                <p>His father, Charles Buonaparte, was an advocate of considerable reputation; and
                    his mother, Letitia Ramolini, a woman eminent alike for personal beauty and
                    uncommon strength of character. When the Corsicans under Paoli rose in arms to
                    assert their liberty against the pretensions of France, Charles Buonaparte
                    espoused the popular side, and, through all the toils and dangers of his
                    mountain campaigns, was attended by his lovely and high-spirited wife. Upon the
                    termination of the war, the father of Napoleon meditated accompanying Paoli into
                    exile; but his relations dissuaded him from taking this step; and being
                    afterwards reconciled to the conquering party, he was protected and patronised
                    by the Comte de Marboeuf, the French governor of Corsica. At the date above
                    mentioned, the man of his age was born upon a temporary couch covered with
                    tapestry, representing the heroes of the Iliad. He was the second child of his
                    parents, Joseph, afterwards king of Spain, being the eldest born; but he had
                    three younger brothers, Lucien, Louis, and Jerome, and three sisters, Eliza,
                    Caroline, and Pauline, all of whom grew up, and several still survive. Five
                    others appear to have died in infancy; and at the age of thirty Letitia became a
                    widow by the death of her husband, who seems to have left his family but
                    indifferently provided for.</p>
                <p>Napoleon’s career has been so extraordinary, that his admirers have sought for
                    prognostics of his future greatness in the circumstances of his infancy and
                    youth. But these persons have deceived themselves. In his early years he
                    betrayed no marked singularity, and when his character began to be formed, its
                    development was too profound and t∞ essentially intellectual to attract the
                    notice of ordinary observers. His education was such as was then usually given
                    in all the military schools. At the age of ten years, he was admitted at that of
                    Brienne, where he spent several years devoted to his studies, and afterwards
                    removed to the military school of Paris, where he appears to have completed his
                    education. That he laboured hard both at Brienne and at Paris, may be judged
                    from the vast quantity of information which his strong memory ever placed at his
                    disposal, and which, from the nature of his after life, must have been nearly,
                    if not wholly, accumulated at this period. He succeeded in all that he
                    undertook, because his will was resolute and his perseverance inflexible. His
                    purpose was strong, and his character decided; circumstances which afterwards
                    gave him an advantage over all the world. The will depends upon the temper and
                    disposition of the individual; it is not in the power of each person to obtain
                    the mastery over himself. This was singularly illustrated in the character of
                    Napoleon. If at times an appearance of uncertainty may be discovered in his
                    resolutions, this did not arise from any defect of will nor infirmity of
                    purpose, but from the extraordinary force of his imagination, which, with the
                    rapidity of lightning, presented to his mind every side or view of a subject. He
                    applied himself to studies which might be useful to him, particularly to history
                    and the mathematics, the former of which developes the genius, whilst the latter
                    regulates its action. His intellectual faculties exerted themselves without any
                    great effort on his part. He had a lively and prompt conception, a strong
                    memory, and a cool and decided judgment. He thought more rapidly than others,
                    and thus had always time for reflection. His mind was too active to find
                    amusement in the ordinary diversions of youth, to which, however, he was not an
                    absolute stranger. He commonly sought for something to interest him, and this
                    disposition placed him in a species of solitude, where he communed only with his
                    own thoughts; a state which afterwards became habitual to him in all the
                    situations of his life.</p>
                <p>His birth having destined him for service, Napoleon had just completed his
                    sixteenth year, when, in August 1785, after being examined by Laplace, he
                    obtained his first commission as lieutenant of artillery in the regiment of <hi
                    rend="italic">La Fere.</hi> Never did he receive any title with so much pleasure
                    as this. He was delighted beyond measure with his promotion, and the highest
                    pitch to which his ambition then aspired was, that he might one day wear a
                    couple of <hi rend="italic">epaulettes a bouillons.</hi> A general of artillery
                    seemed to him the <hi rend="italic">ne plus ultra</hi> of human grandeur. But if
                    he was not yet ambitious of power, he was already desirous of fame, and had
                    conceived the idea of making himself a name by writing the history of the war in
                    Corsica. He communicated his intention to Paoli, at the same time requesting
                    that that officer would furnish him with the necessary information; but an
                    historian of eighteen did not probably inspire any great confidence, and Paoli
                    took no notice of his proposal. His advancement, however, indemnified him for
                    this little mortification. In the year 1789, he obtained a company of artillery;
                    and the Revolution, which broke out immediately afterwards, seemed to open up a
                    new and more enlarged sphere of action. This is not the place to enter into any
                    formal exposition of the causes which ultimately produced that violent shock of
                    interests, out of which resulted the Revolution, with its long train of crimes
                    and innovations; still less is it our intention to trace the progress of that
                    mighty movement from the date of its immediate commencement until the moment
                    when the subject of this notice first appeared upon the scene. Such a task is
                    compatible neither with the object of the present article nor with the limits to
                    which it is necessarily restricted; nor have we yet arrived at the time when,
                    even if the case were otherwise, it could be executed in a manner corresponding
                    to the magnitude and the importance of the subject. It appears, however, that
                    Napoleon, young as he was, formed a very accurate estimate of its general
                    complexion, as well as of its true bearing and direction. Aware that revolutions
                    almost always proceed from opinions or interests compressed, or from opinions
                    allied with interests, he was equally convinced that, when demands founded on
                    justice and reason remained unsatisfied; when the mass of the nation had arrayed
                    itself against the privileged orders, and a collision had in consequence taken
                    place; the commotion, however violent, would in time subside, leaving the field
                    open to genius, valour, and fortune, when happily united in one individual. But
                    in order ultimately to command events, he saw that it was in the first instance
                    necessary to go along with them; to profit by circumstances up to a certain
                    point; and to remain in observation until the time for action should at length
                    arrive. Hence he declared for the Revolution, because he foresaw that with it
                    all his hopes and prospects were identified. “Had I been a general,” <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193828465" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8465-0712"/>said he, in the
                    evening of his life, “I might have adhered to the king; but being a subaltern, I
                    joined the patriots.”</p>
                <p>Happening to be in Paris in the year 1792, he witnessed the scene of the 20th
                    June, when the revolutionary mob stormed the Tuileries, and placed the lives of
                    the king and his family in the greatest jeopardy. He followed the crowd into the
                    garden before the palace, and when Louis XVI. appeared on a balcony with the red
                    cap on his head, he could no longer suppress his contempt and indignation. “Poor
                    driveller,” said Napoleon; “how could he suffer this rabble to enter? If he had
                    swept away five or six hundred of them with his cannon, the rest would soon have
                    disappeared.” He was also a witness of the events of the 10th of August, when
                    the throne was overturned, a provisional council established, the king confined
                    in the Temple, the republic proclaimed, and a national convention called to
                    frame a charter. At this time he was without employment, and poor; wandering
                    idly about Paris, living at the shops of restaurateurs, projecting a variety of
                    schemes some of them wild enough, and in a great measure dependent upon the
                    scanty resources of his class-fellow Bourrienne. But the circumstances of the
                    times were such that he was not suffered to remain long inactive. Being offered
                    the command of a battalion of national volunteers destined to join the
                    expedition to Sardinia, he readily accepted it; and, upon the return of the
                    expedition, he re-entered the artillery with the rank of superior officer, or
                    commandant. Till the siege of Toulon, however, he led an insignificant life. But
                    this operation proved, in some measure, decisive of his fortunes. He saw that,
                    from the situation which he held, as second in command of the artillery, he
                    might have some influence on the result of the siege; and the event justified
                    his anticipations.</p>
                <p>When, towards the close of August 1793, Toulon, the great port and arsenal of
                    France on the Mediterranean, had, along with the fleet, been delivered into the
                    hands of the allies, the situation of France was truly deplorable. Lyons had
                    raised the standard of the Bourbons; civil war raged in Languedoc and Provence;
                    the victorious Spanish army had passed the Pyrenees, and overrun Roussillon; and
                    the Piedmontese army, having cleared the Alps, was at the gates of Chambery and
                    Antibes. Terror, discord, and defection reigned within; whilst, on the
                    frontiers, one reverse followed hard at the heels of another. But the allies
                    were not sufficiently sensible of the importance of the acquisition which they
                    had just made. If thirty thousand Sardinians, Neapolitans, Spaniards, and
                    English, had united with the twelve thousand <hi rend="italic">fédérés</hi> in
                    Toulon, this army of forty thousand men and upwards might have advanced upon
                    Lyons, connecting itself by the right with the Piedmontese, and by the left with
                    the Spanish army, and by this movement might have decided the fate of the
                    Revolution. But the allies did not understand the real importance of their
                    position, nor appreciate the advantages which it afforded.</p>
                <p>About six weeks were passed in assembling the force and means necessary for the
                    siege. On the 15th of October, a council of war was assembled at Olioulles,
                    where the conventional proconsul Gasparin presided; and on this occasion, there
                    was read to the council a memoir on the conduct of the siege of Toulon, which
                    had béen drawn up by the celebrated engineer D’Arcon, and approved by the
                    committee of fortifications. Napoleon opposed the adoption of this plan, and
                    proposed one much more simple. It was probable, he thought, that the allies
                    would not abandon twelve thousand men in Toulon if the besiegers occupied the
                    two forts which commanded the roadstead at its extremities; on the contrary, as
                    soon as the communication between the English fleet and the garrison should be
                    seriously threatened, it might be calculated that they would either evacuate the
                    place or be made prisoners. “Your object,” said he, “is to make the English
                    evacuate Toulon. Instead of attacking them in the town, which must involve a
                    series of operations, and ruin the place, endeavour to establish batteries so as
                    to sweep the harbour and roadstead. If you do this, the English ships must take
                    their departure, and the English troops will certainly not remain behind them.
                    He then pointed out a promontory nearly opposite the town, by establishing
                    batteries on which the desired effect might be; attained. “Gain La Grasse,” said
                    he, “and in two days Tθulon will be yours.” Had this suggestion been adopted in
                    time, the result would have been as Napoleon prognosticated; but the English had
                    leisure allowed them to construct Fort Mulgrave, and to render it so strong that
                    it went by the name of Little Gibraltar. Nevertheless, Napoleon’s system
                    prevailed. Instead of attacking the body of the place, the principal effort was
                    directed against Fort Mulgrave, the reduction of which would secure the command
                    of the narrow passage between the port and the Mediterranean, thus rendering an
                    immediate evacuation inevitable; and in a month the desired end was obtained. On
                    the 18th of December the besiegers entered Toulon, but were able to save only
                    the half of the squadron; the other half, the arsenal, and the dock-yards,
                    having been consumed by the conflagration kindled by the English as they
                    abandoned the place.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>During the siege of Toulon, Napoleon, whilst constructing a battery under
                    the enemy’s fire, had occasion to prepare an order, and called for some one who
                    could write with facility. A young seijeant stepped out, and, leaning on the
                    breast-work, wrote as he dictated. The writing was just finished, when a shot
                    struck the ground by the side of the volunteer secretary, scattering dust over
                    him and every thing near him. “Good,” said the serjeant, laughing; “we shall
                    this time have no need of sand.” The cool gaiety of the remark pleased Napoleon;
                    he kept his eye on the man; and Junot—for it was he—rose in the sequel to the
                    rank of a marshal of France, and was created Duke of Abrantes.</p></note></p>
                <p>The recovery of Toulon was a service of the very first importance to the
                    revolutionary government. It suppressed the insurrectionary spirit in the south
                    of France, restored the credit of the republican arms, and rendered disposable
                    the force which had been employed in the siege. But the man to whose genius
                    alone success was due did not immediately obtain the credit of this important
                    achievement, the absurd vanity of the representatives of the people having led
                    them to claim the merit of expelling the English. The truth, however, was too
                    generally known to be effectually concealed. Napoleon was appointed general of
                    brigade, and, in the beginning of 1794, sent to the army of Italy to command the
                    artillery. The general-in-chief, Dumerbion, was old, and incapable; the head of
                    his staff, though a man of information, wanted talents; and, between them, war
                    was carried on without art or skill in the Maritime Alps. Napoleon proposed a
                    plan for turning the famous position of Saorgio. His suggestion was adopted;
                    Saorgio, with all its stores, surrendered, and the French obtained possession of
                    the Maritime Alps. He then proposed another, which had for its object to unite
                    the army of the Alps and that.of Italy under the walls of Coni; an operation
                    which would have secured Piedmont, and enabled the combined force, without any
                    great effort, to establish itself on the Po. But it was found impossible to come
                    to an arrangement with the staff of the army of the Alps, because it would have
                    been necessary to fuse the two armies into one, under a single chief, and
                    neither general was disposed to yield. Besides, such an operation could not be
                    undertaken without the approbation of the committee of public safety, which
                    affected to direct the war from Paris, as the aulic council did from Vienna.
                    Napoleon, however, indemnified himself by carrying the army of Italy as far as
                    Savona, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828478" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8478-0713"/>and to
                    the gates of Ceva; by which means he disengaged Genoa, then threatened by the
                    allies, and would have achieved more important results had not his progress been
                    stopped by the approach of winter and the imperative orders of the committee. He
                    was superseded on the 6th of August 1794, apparently in consequence of the
                    labours of Aubry, who had reformed the organization of the army, in order to
                    impart to it greater solidity.</p>
                <p>Before the end of the year he went to Paris in order to solicit employment, but
                    at first experienced a very cold reception, probably on account of his supposed
                    connection with Robespierre, whose younger brother he was known to have lived
                    with on terms of friendship. The re-action consequent on the downfall of that
                    extraordinary personage was then at its height, and threatened France with evils
                    not less terrible than those from which it had just escaped.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It appears that Robespierre
                    was overthrown by the party of the terrorists themselves, because he had
                    announced that it was time to put an end to their horrid system, and to return
                    to a less expeditious kind of justice. Terror was with him a means, not an end;
                    and it would have ceased with his triumph, as it did in some measure with his
                    fall. The character of this astonishing personage has not yet been well
                    developed, and it is even probable that it will continue to be misunderstood or
                    misrepresented in history.</p></note> Everything was in an unsettled state, and
                    the monthly renewal of the committee of public safety served only to increase
                    the confusion. After a time, however, Napoleon was placed amongst the generals
                    of infantry appointed to serve in La Vendée; but he refused to act in a
                    situation which he considered as altogether unsuitable to him, and resolved to
                    remain at Paris, where he might be more usefully employed. This proved a
                    fortunate determination, and soon led to service of a more congenial kind.
                    Kellermann had just allowed himself to be beaten in the Apennines. The committee
                    were anxious to repair the disaster, and with this view attached Napoleon to the
                    board of military operations, with orders to prepare such instructions as might
                    seem calculated to bring back victory to the national standards. This afforded
                    him an opportunity of making his talents known, and probably contributed not a
                    little to the future advancement of his fortunes. Soon afterwards, he was
                    appointed to command a brigade of artillery in Holland, where for some time the
                    war had languished; but before he could avail himself of this appointment, his
                    services were required upon a nearer and more important field of action.</p>
                <p>Since the conquest of Holland, the armies had remained half a year inactive
                    behind the Rhine; but though military operations were suspended, the agitation
                    of the interior increased, and the clamours of faction became much more violent
                    than ever. The Jacobins, wishing to resume their hold of power, which the fall
                    of Robespierre had wrenched from their grasp, raised the faubourgs against the
                    Convention; famine excited their adherents, and Paris was threatened with
                    conflagration and massacre. The majority of the inhabitants, however, declared
                    for the Convention, or, to speak more correctly, against the terrorists; the
                    deputies were delivered from the daggers of the assassins; and Pichegru, at the
                    head of some troops, disarmed the revolted faubourgs. But the Jacobins, though
                    defeated, were by no means subdued. The momentary triumph of the Convention
                    became the signal of partial re-actions; civil war raged in all the provinces of
                    the south; and the royalists, believing that the moment for striking a vigorous
                    blow had arrived, landed at Quiberon an expedition, consisting of the corps of
                    emigrants in the pay of Great Britain. The result of this ill-fated attempt is
                    well known; it was defeated by the energy and activity of Hoche; and the unhappy
                    victims whom the sword had spared were destroyed by the proconsuls of the
                    Convention. Still the power and influence of that body rested on a very
                    precarious foundation. The monstrous government of the provisional committees
                    could not last. A commission named by the Convention was charged with framing a
                    charter; and at its head figured Siéyes, who flattered himself with the idea of
                    establishing an equiponderance of powers, and governing the state by means of
                    popular elections. His constitution of the year III. established a legislative
                    council of five hundred members, and a council of ancients as a chamber of
                    revision. The councils were renewable by thirds annually; and the executive
                    power was intrusted to a Directory of five persons, renewable by a fifth
                    annually, and entirely subordinate to the legislative power. Although these
                    institutions were preferable to the revolutionary committees, yet they were not
                    less dangerous in their application; nevertheless, they were at first received
                    as a plank of safety by a nation fatigued and harassed with all sorts of horrors
                    and revolutions. But the Convention, dreading the influence of their adversaries
                    in the elections, and taking warning by the conduct of the Constituent Assembly,
                    decreed, first, that the electoral bodies, in choosing representatives to the
                    new councils, should be obliged to elect two thirds of the actual members of
                    Convention; secondly, that if two thirds were not returned, the Convention
                    should have the right to supply the deficiency out of their own body; and,
                    thirdly, that the relations of emigrants should be excluded from the exercise of
                    legislative functions.</p>
                <p>This precaution was incontestably in the interest of the republicans, as it
                    served to postpone for two years a re-action which there seemed good reason to
                    apprehend. But the enemies of the Convention took advantage of the hatred
                    inspired by the Jacobins in order to raise the whole population of Paris against
                    decrees which seemed dictated only by a desire, upon the part of that body, to
                    perpetuate their power. Of the forty-eight sections, there were at least thirty
                    opposed both to the decrees and to the actual members of the Convention; and all
                    of them were armed, each having his battalion in the national guards. The
                    royalist agents were also on the watch to profit by a movement which, if
                    successful, might in a moment change the political aspect of France. Both
                    parties, therefore, resolved to have recourse to force; the Convention, to carry
                    into effect its decrees; and the sections, to constrain it to dissolve itself,
                    in terms of the constitution. In these circumstances, it was proposed to
                    Napoleon to command, under Barras, the armed force destined to act against the
                    Parisians. He consented, upon condition ofbeing left free from all interference,
                    and lost not a moment in sending to Meudon for the artillery. He had five
                    thousand men and forty pieces of cannon, a force more than sufficient to put
                    down a riot, but not too much against a national guard well armed, and provided
                    with artillery; and he was reinforced by fifteen hundred patriots, organized in
                    three battalions.</p>
                <p>On the 13th of Vendémiaire (4th of October), the sectionaries marched against the
                    Convention. One of their columns, debouching in the Rue Saint-Honoré, advanced
                    boldly to the attack; but it was instantly checked by the fire of the artillery,
                    which swept the street with grapeshot, and soon afterwards it gave way in
                    confusion. A number of the fugitives attempted to make a stand on the steps of
                    the church of St Roche, where, owing to the narrowness of the street, they were
                    in a great measure sheltered from the fire of the artillery. Napoleon, however,
                    promptly brought a gun to bear upon them, and in a few minutes this crowd was
                    dispersed, leaving behind them a number of dead. The column which debouched by
                    the Port-Royal was not more fortunate. Exposed to the direct fire of the guns
                    stationed below the Tuileries, and taken in flank by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193828491" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8491-0714"/>that of the other batteries
                    by which the bridge was commanded, all its efforts to establish itself upon the
                    quays of the Seine proved unavailing, and, after a very short struggle, it
                    dispersed, and fled in all directions. In less than an hour the whole was ended,
                    and the Convention victorious. This event, so trivial in itself, and which
                    scarcely cost two hundred men on each side, had important consequences. It
                    prevented the revolution from retrograding; it enabled the Convention to disarm
                    the sections; and, above all, it had a marked influence upon the future fortunes
                    of Napoleon. The eminent service he had rendered was immediately rewarded with
                    the rank of general of division; in five days he was named second in command of
                    the army of the interior; and soon afterwards, on the resignation of Barras, he
                    was advanced to the chief command. He had now passed into the order of marked
                    and distinguished men. But the situation which he held was by no means suited to
                    his views. He longed to make war upon a more extended theatre of action, and to
                    profit by the advantages which fortune had thrown in his way.</p>
                <p>It was at this time, when his residence in Paris had begun to appear
                    insupportable to his active mind, that he became acquainted with the widow of
                    General Beauharnais, whom he afterwards married. At the moment when the sections
                    were disarmed, the sword of her husband, who had perished by the guillotine, a
                    victim of the tyranny of Robespierre, had been taken from her; and she now sent
                    her son Eugene, a boy of fifteen, to beg that it might be restored to her. Her
                    request was at once complied with, and the boy shed tears as he received from
                    the hands of Napoleon the sword of his unfortunate father. This scene touched
                    Napoleon; and, having gone to give an account ofittothe mother of Eugene, he was
                    so enchanted with her elegance and grace, that he soon afterwards made her a
                    tender of his hand, which was accepted. Such appears to be the simple truth in
                    regard to the origin of his relations with Josephine, concerning which so many
                    absurd and injurious stories have been circulated. Napoleon had little relish
                    for the society of women, which accorded neither with his tastes nor his
                    character, and in which he experienced constraint; but, being desirous to fix
                    himself in life, and finding in Josephine spirit and elegance united with
                    celebrity, he resolved to espouse her. The marriage took place on the 9th of
                    March 1796, only a few days before he set out to assume the command of the army
                    of Italy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>At one time
                    any slanderous or infamous story derogatory to Napoleon readily gained credit in
                    this country; indeed, the more slanderous or the more infamous the tale, the
                    greater became the certainty that it would be believed. The credulity of
                    national hatred was not shocked by ordinary improbabilities. For instance, it
                    was commonly said, and, we may add, universally believed, that Josephine was a
                    woman of indifferent character, or worse; that she possessed more than
                    legitimate influence over Barras, the first Director; and that Napoleon, by his
                    marriage with her, cemented his connection with the society of the Luxembourg,
                    particularly with Barras and Tallien, then the most powerful men in France. The
                    common belief, however, is altogether unsupported by evidence, in as far at
                    least as we have been able to discover; and there are many circumstances which
                    seem to show conclusively that both the imputation itself, and the inference
                    deduced from it as to Napoleon’s views in marrying this lady, were equally
                    false. It is not denied that her subsequent conduct was admirable and exemplary;
                    that the influence she possessed over her husband was always exerted on the side
                    of humanity; and that she alone could overrule, by gentleness, those ebullitions
                    of passion to which he was liable. Why, then, on the faith of mere slanderous
                    rumour, impeach her conduct previous to her marriage with Napoleon? Is it
                    probable that he who so fully recognised the necessity of discountenancing
                    immorality, and who afterwards drove from his presence and his service all women
                    of questionable reputation, would have done so had he been conscious that he had
                    married a person of doubtful or indifferent reputation? Can any one be so silly
                    as to imagine that the supposed illegitimate influence of such a person was
                    necessary to the man who had saved the government from destruction, and had been
                    appointed commander-in-chief of the army of the interior before he knew of her
                    existence? Napoleon, indeed, always believed that his fortunes were bound up in
                    some mysterious manner with those of this graceful and accomplished woman. But
                    this was the superstition of deep-rooted affection, the fatalism of a love which
                    could never have been excited by the hackneyed endearments of a woman who had
                    carried her virtue to market.</p></note></p>
                <p>Tranquillity being now restored at Paris, the Directory had time to turn their
                    attention to the state of affairs, particularly to that of the army of Italy,
                    the condition of which was by no means satisfactory. It was determined to
                    supersede Scherer, who had disappointed the expectations of the Directory, and
                    to give it a new general; and as the chief command of the army of the interior
                    naturally led to that of an active force, provided the individual holding it
                    possessed the confidence of the government, Napoleon was consequently appointed
                    general-in-chief of the army of Italy. To this command he had pre-eminent, and
                    indeed exclusive, claims. When serving under General Dumerbion, as commandant of
                    artillery, he had turned the important position of Saorgio, and disengaged
                    Genoa, then threatened by the allies; when employed at the board of military
                    operations, he had digested a plan of campaign, the result of which was the
                    signal victory gained at Lo-ano, and the possession of the line of the
                    Apennines, as far as Savona and the sources of the Bormida; and now, whenbrought
                    into more direct contact with the government, he satisfied Carnot, to whom the
                    direction of military operations was intrusted, that his plan in regard to
                    Piedmont, which had been rejected by the committee of public safety in 1794,
                    might still be executed, with every prospect of success. These circumstances,
                    independently of his services at Toulon, and also against the insurgent sections
                    of Paris, naturally pointed him out as the person best qualified to obtain that
                    success of which the Directory, at this time, stood so much in need, in order to
                    support its credit and consolidate its power. That his talents were fully
                    appreciated, and that to the opinion entertained of them he was solely indebted
                    for this splendid command, admits of no doubt whatever. “Advance this young
                    man,” said Barras to one of his colleagues, “or he will advance himself without
                    you.” Napoleon quitted his wife ten days after their marriage, and, after a
                    rapid journey, arrived at the headquarters of the army at Nice. From that moment
                    the most brilliant scene of his existence began to open. « In three months,”
                    said he, “I shall be either at Milan or at Paris” and before a year elapsed, he
                    had grown old in victory.</p>
                <p>The plan which he proposed for the campaign united all suffrages; for, though at
                    once bold and original, it was, in reality, extremely simple. It had been agreed
                    that he should manoeuvre by his right, in order to descend by Montferrat upon
                    Lombardy, directing all his efforts against the Austrians, in the hope of
                    detaching Piedmont from the imperial alliance. The armies of Germany being
                    reorganised, were to resume the offensive by the end of April, and to endeavour
                    to pass the Rhine. Jourdan, who commanded seventy thousand men on the Lower
                    Rhine, was to blockade Mayence with thirty thousand, and to advance into
                    Franconia with from forty to fifty thousand. Moreau, who had nearly an equal
                    number under him, was to mask Manheim, and advance in Suabia; and it was
                    proposed that both should unite in the heart of Bavaria. As to Napoleon, he had
                    no other task to perform than that of advancing on the Adige; provided he
                    succeeded by his victories in detaching Piedmont from the coalition, or in
                    dethroning the king of Sardinia, if the latter should refuse to make peace. In a
                    word, this plan was merely a copy of that which Napoleon had previously drawn up
                    for the committee, and the execution of which that body had recklessly <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193828504" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8504-0715"/> intrusted to the
                    incapable Scherer. Its distinctive characteristic consisted in the mode by which
                    it was proposed to gain access to the fertile regions of Italy. Former invaders
                    had uniformly penetrated the Alps at some point or other of that mighty range of
                    mountains. Napoleon judged that the same end might be more easily attained by
                    turning them; that is, by advancing along the narrow gorge of comparatively
                    level country which intervenes between these huge barriers and the
                    Mediterranean, and by forcing a passage at that point where the last elevations
                    of the Alps pass by gradual transition into the first and lowest of the Apennine
                    range. The military advantages of operating in this direction will be
                    immediately apparent.</p>
                <p>Napoleon arrived at Nice on the 27th of March, and there found the army in a very
                    precarious as well as destitute condition. Perched upon the summits of the
                    Apennines, from Savona to Ormea, it was too much disseminated, and its
                    communications with France, running along the coast in a parallel direction
                    between the enemy’s line and the sea, were everywhere exposed; whilst the
                    soldiers were in rags, without shoes, and a prey to almost every species of
                    misery.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The allies
                    called the French, in derision, “the heroes in rags,” and they were right; the
                    soldiers of the republic, though destitute of every thing, were nevertheless
                    heroes in the best sense of the term.</p></note> Napoleon lost not a moment in
                    placing the army in more advantageous positions, and in announcing that he was
                    about to assume the offensive, with a view to provide for its wants, at the same
                    time that he consulted its glory. This announcement had the desired effect. The
                    soldiers forgot their privations, and eagerly longed to signalise their courage
                    and devotion under the young chief who had promised to lead them to victory.
                    Having occupied the principal roads leading from Niee to Italy, particularly
                    that which sweeps to the north by Saorgio, and crosses the chain of the Alps at
                    the Col di Tende, forming the great road to Turin by Coni, the Corniche, or road
                    leading to Genoa, along the coast between the rocks and the sea, and other lines
                    of communication, Napoleon demanded of the senate of Genoa a free passage by the
                    city and the Boehetta, along the road leading from Genoa to Alexandria,
                    promising, in return, to carry the theatre of war beyond its frontiers, and to
                    insure it the alliance and protection of the French republic. This demand was
                    exceedingly artful. If the senate complied, Napoleon would débouché by Genoa in
                    order to overpower the left of the Austrians, drive them back on Alexandria,
                    take all the defences of Piedmont in reverse, detach it from the imperial
                    alliance, effect a junction with the army of Kellermann, and pursue Beaulieu as
                    far as the Tyrol. If the senate refused, he foresaw that that body would
                    immediately make a merit of its refusal with the allies, and that the latter
                    would extend their left in order to anticipate the French at the Boehetta; a
                    movement which would place the mass of the enemy’s forces at the two
                    extremities, near Ceva and Genoa, and thus leave the centre isolated and
                    exposed. But before this plan could take effect, Beaulieu, excited by the aulic
                    council, had resolved to assume the offensive, and to advance upon Genoa with
                    the third of his army, whilst the remainder occupied the attention of the French
                    in front.</p>
                <p>On the 10th of April the Austrian general descended from the Apennines by the
                    Boehetta, at the head of his left wing, and having dislodged the advanced guard
                    of the French from Voltri, attacked three redoubts which covered the important
                    counterfort of the Apennines that descends upon Savona. Two of these redoubts
                    were carried, but, by the intrepid valour of Colonel Rampon, the third was
                    maintained against enormous odds during the whole of the day, and in the night
                    he was reinforced by the divi-</p>
                <p>sion of Laharpe. Meanwhile Napoleon assembled the mass of his forces against the
                    Austrian centre, which had advanced from Sassello upon Montenotte; and on the
                    12th, Argenteau, who commanded it, was attacked in front and reverse; defeated,
                    and thrown back upon Dego. This first success was the more important, as it
                    completely disconcerted the combinations of the enemy. In order to profit by it,
                    Napoleon, leaving Laharpe to observe Beaulieu, marched against the Piedmontese
                    under Colli, and on the 13th defeated them at Millesimo, cut off Provera with
                    2000 Austrians, and forced him to lay down his arms on the morning of the 14th.
                    But the defeat of Montenotte having given the alarm to the Austrians, they now
                    sought to concentrate on Dego. Napoleon instantly suspended his march against
                    the Piedmontese, and returning to the Austrians, defeated them in a double
                    combat at Dego; overpowering in succession the corps of Argenteau, and that of
                    Wukassowich, which had hurried to his assistance. He then resumed his operations
                    against Colli, who, pressed with superior forces in front, whilst his left was
                    menaced by Augereau, was obliged to evacuate the camp of Ceva, and forced to
                    retire behind the Cursaglia and the Elero. Napoleon pursued him warmly, and
                    having again beaten him at Viconear Mondovi, drove him behind the Stura as far
                    as Carmagnola. Another battle would have put him in possession of Turin, from
                    which he was distant only about ten leagues, and in which disorder and terror
                    were now at their height. But this calamity was averted by the submission of the
                    court; and at Cherasco the conqueror concluded a sort of armistice, by which the
                    king of Sardinia engaged to deliver up Coni, Alexandria, and Ceva, to withdraw
                    from the coalition, and to send the Count de Ravel to Paris to treat of a
                    definitive accommodation.</p>
                <p>Thus, in somewhat less than a month, Napoleon, with an army destitute of
                    everything, had gained six victories, taken twenty-one standards, fifty guns,
                    and several strong places, conquered the richest part of Piedmont, made fifteen
                    thousand prisoners, and killed or wounded ten thousand men; he had reduced the
                    Austrians to inaction, destroyed the army of the king of Sardinia, detached him
                    from the imperial alliance, wrested from his hands the keys of the Alps, and
                    established a solid basis for his future operations. In a few days he had done
                    more than the former army of Italy in four campaigns; he had displayed
                    consummate genius in achieving victory, and proved that he combined with it the
                    still rarer talent of turning it to profit, by promptly gathering up its fruits.
                    But his hopes were not yet realised. To deliver Italy from the German yoke, and
                    to falsify the proverb which regarded that country as the tomb of the French,
                    was the task which he still reserved for himself, and which he hesitated the
                    less to undertake, as the armistice had left him at liberty to direct his whole
                    force against the isolated army of Beaulieu, now too much enfeebled to resist
                    his attacks with any chance of success.</p>
                <p>No commander ever appreciated more justly than Napoleon the value of time in
                    military operations. The day after the signature of the treaty of Cherasco, he
                    put his divisions in motion, and directed them upon Alexandria. Beaulieu, having
                    already passed the Po at the bridge of Valenza, which he destroyed, had taken a
                    position at Valeggio on the Ogogno, pushing detachments on the Sesia and to the
                    left of the Tesino. By a very ingenious stratagem, Napoleon had led the Austrian
                    general to believe that he would pass the Po in the neighbourhood of
                    Valenza,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In order to
                    mislead Beaulieu as to his intentions, Napoleon had caused to be inserted in the
                    armistice with the Piedmontese a clause in which it was stipulated that he
                    should be at liberty to effect the passage of the Po in the neighbourhood of
                    Valenza. The stratagem succeeded beyond his expectation. The intelligence was
                    conveyed to Beaulieu, and completely deceived the unwary Austrian.</p></note>
                    and attack his adversary in front on the Tesino, instead<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193828517" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8517-0716"/> of operating on his rear;
                    and, under this impression, Beaulieu directed his whole attention to the space
                    between the Ogogno and Valenza. To confirm him in his error, Napoleon moved a
                    detachment on Salo, as if for the purpose of passing the Po at Cambio, and,
                    under cover of this demonstration, carried his army by its right, and rapidly
                    descended the river, himself conducting the van-guard, in order to accelerate
                    its march. He arrived at Piacenza on the 7th of May, closely followed by his
                    divisions, disposed <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">echelons;</hi>
                    and immediately commenced the passage of the river by means of the small craft
                    which he found at that place and its environs. On the opposite bank the
                    Austrians had two squadrons, which were promptly repulsed by Lannes, at the head
                    of the van-guard, and the passage continued, though slowly, until the whole army
                    had crossed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>No
                    operation in war is more critical than the passage of a great river in the face
                    of an enemy; yet, singularly enough, none has more frequently succeeded. The Po,
                    which scarcely yields to the Rhine in the breadth and depth of its bed, is a
                    barrier difficult to pass. On this occasion, however, Napoleon, although he had
                    no means of constructing a bridge, and was obliged to content himself with the
                    small boats which he found on the river itself, effected the passage, with very
                    trifling loss, and established himself upon the communications of
                    Beaulieu.</p></note> Meanwhile Beaulieu, being at length informed of the
                    movement on Piacenza, manoeuvred to oppose it; but, instead of advancing
                    vigorously against the portion of the French army which had already passed the
                    river, he took only half measures, insufficient to arrest the progress of the
                    enemy, and resolved to support his left on the Adda, without abandoning the line
                    of the Tesino, where he had placed his right. On the 8th of May General Liptay,
                    commanding the Austrian left, established himself at Fiombino, in front of the
                    French van-guard; but being instantly attacked by Lannes, he was defeated,
                    separated from Beaulieu, and forced back on Pizzighetone. In the night following
                    this affair Beaulieu arrived on the ground where his lieutenant had just been
                    beaten, and some confusion took place at Codogno, which was occupied by the
                    division of Laharpe; but finding himself, with a few battalions, in the presence
                    of a greatly superior force, he was obliged to withdraw, and to endeavour to
                    concentrate his army towards Lodi, where he had a bridge on the Adda, leaving
                    his right to gain Cassano as it best might; an attempt in which it would not
                    have succeeded, if the difficulties inseparable from the passage of a great
                    river had not retarded the march of the French troops.</p>
                <p>Although the road to Milan had thus been laid open, yet the possession of that
                    important place could be of but little avail, and would necessarily be very
                    insecure, as long as the enemy were able to maintain themselves behind the Adda.
                    It was therefore of primary importance to force them to retire; and with this
                    view Napoleon marched on Lodi, at the head of the grenadiers and the corps of
                    Massena and Augereau, leaving before Pizzighetone a division to mask that place
                    and cover his right, and taking measures for the safety of his left, by
                    directing Serrurier upon Pavia. On the 10th he arrived before Lodi, where
                    Beaulieu, having retired with the main body of his army to Crema, had left
                    General Sebottendorf with ten thousand men to defend both sides of the Adda. By
                    means of this strong rear-guard the enemy had hoped to preserve the bridge of
                    Lodi, which was defended by twenty pieces of cannon established on the left
                    bank; but they soon found that they had reckoned without their host. A battalion
                    and some squadrons which occupied the town of Lodi were, without much
                    difficulty, dislodged, and the French reached the bridge before the enemy’s
                    workmen had time to cut it down. Napoleon instantly formed his grenadiers in
                    close column, and rushed along the bridge. The troops advanced with loud shouts
                    to the attack, but, being assailed by a perfect storm of grape-shot, they
                    hesitated for a moment, and began to waver. The generals, including Napoleon
                    himself, hurried to the front, cheering and animating the men by their example.
                    The effect was electric. The column dashed along the bridge in spite of the
                    tempest of fire which thinned their ranks, overthrew all that opposed their
                    progress, carried the enemy’s batteries at the point of the bayonet, and
                    dispersed his battalions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The success of this attack was facilitated by the very circumstance which
                    seemed to prognosticate instant failure. Whilst the troops hesitated under the
                    storm of fire with which they were assailed on the bridge, some soldiers slid
                    down by the piles into an island in the river, where they hoped to find some
                    point of attack less exposed to the enemy’s fire. Here they discovered that the
                    second branch of the Adda was fordable, upon which a battalion immediately
                    spread itself out <hi rend="italic">en tirailleurs,</hi> in order to turn the
                    Austrian line; and, thus favoured, the mass of grenadiers passed the bridge at
                    the <hi rend="italic">pas de charge.</hi></p></note> Sebottendorf retreated upon
                    Crema, with the loss of fifteen guns, and two thousand men killed or wounded.
                    This, though only an affair of the rear-guard, was a daring feat of arms; and
                    its immediate consequences were the occupation of Pizzighetone, the retreat of
                    Beaulieu towards the Mincio, and the triumphal entry of Napoleon into Milan,
                    where his presence had become absolutely necessary. As the French troops had
                    been in continued motion for a month, it was judged expedient to allow them some
                    days rest, and hence Beaulieu was not pursued.</p>
                <p>Having thus descended like a torrent from the Apennines, overthrown and dispersed
                    all that opposed him, separated Piedmont from the coalition, received the
                    submission of the Dukes of Parma and Modena, driven the Austrians behind the
                    Mincio, and entered the capital of Lombardy in triumph, Napoleon immediately
                    directed his attention to the internal administration of the country, prescribed
                    the measures necessary for the reduction of the citadel of Milan, imposed
                    contributions, and made arrangements for establishing the republican system in
                    Italy; that is, for destroying the ancient regime, in order to substitute in its
                    stead that equality which formed the pole-bolt of the revolution. His career of
                    victory had been one of unexampled rapidity, and he now sought to secure and
                    consolidate the conquests he had made. The intelligence of his success, however,
                    appears to have excited astonishment and suspicion in the minds of the French
                    Directory, who perceived with alarm that their young general had already made
                    himself master of Italy. Scarcely had he reached Milan, when he received orders
                    to divide his army in two; to give up the command of that of Italy to
                    Kellermann, who was to observe the Austrians on the Mincio; and with the
                    remaining 25,000 men, forming an army of the south, to advance upon Rome, and
                    even to act against Naples. But this division of force, at the moment when it
                    was about to contend against all the resources of the house of Austria, was a
                    great deal too absurd to be submitted to by a commander like Napoleon; he
                    answered by resigning his command, and thus saved the army from inevitable
                    destruction. Meanwhile he resolved to drive Beaulieu into the Tyrol, and with
                    this view he addressed to his soldiers one of the most remarkable proclamations
                    that ever proceeded from his pen. He knew well the men with whom he had to deal;
                    he knew that the French soldiery, full of fire and enthusiasm, would be
                    transported by an appeal which awakened in their minds heroic sentiments; he
                    knew that such an address would produce at Rome or at Naples the same effect as
                    it had done at Turin; he knew, also, that in proportion as he exalted the
                    courage of his troops, he struck terror into those of the enemy, and at the same
                    time bequeathed to posterity a monument of his talent for command. The revolt of
                    Lombardy for a moment endangered<pb break="no" facs="nls:193828530"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8530-0717"/> the success of his plan. On the day when he
                    quitted Milan to advance against the Austrians, the tocsin sounded in the rear
                    of his army; the people flew to arms, and having seized upon Pavia, put the
                    garrison to death. The least hesitation on his part would have rendered this
                    rising general. Without stopping the march of the army, he proceeded in all
                    haste to Pavia, followed by 300 horse and a battalion of grenadiers, at the head
                    of which he forced the gates, penetrated into the city, which was delivered up
                    to pillage, ordered the municipality to be shot, and thus, by one vigorous blow,
                    extinguished the insurrection in its principal focus. At Benasco Lannes acted
                    with equal promptitude and severity; and at Lugo, where a squadron of French
                    horse had been destroyed, a number of the male inhabitants were shot.<note

                    easily said, but is it well founded? Was no atonement due for the lives of the
                    brave men who had been cruelly massacred by an infuriate rabble? Upon what
                    principle can impunity be claimed in behalf of assassins? On such an occasion,
                    clemency on the part of Napoleon would have been a crime against his army. “Il

                    tom. i. p. 109.)</p></note></p>
                <p>After the defeat of Lodi, Beaulieu had not ventured to halt behind the Oglio, nor
                    even behind the Chiesa. He preferred the stronger line of the Mincio, flanked on
                    the left by the fortress of Mantua, and on the right by the Lago di Garda and
                    the mountains of the Tyrol. Behind this barrier he established his army, with
                    his centre posted at Vallegio, his left at Goito, and his right at Peschiera, a
                    small place belonging to the Venetians. As the wings thus rested upon two strong
                    places, Napoleon resolved to force the centre; at the same time making
                    demonstrations on the side of Peschiera, which covered the enemy’s line of
                    retreat to the Tyrol. On the 30th of May, he arrived at Borghetto with the mass
                    of his army, and immediately dislodged an advanced guard of the enemy, stationed
                    on the left of the Mincio. Having repaired the bridge of Borghetto, which the
                    Austrians had partly destroyed in their retreat, he was preparing to force the
                    passage of the river, when a column of grenadiers threw themselves into the
                    stream, carrying their arms on their heads, as the water reached to their
                    shoulders. The enemy, believing themselves about to be attacked by the
                    redoubtable column of Lodi, gave way, and, taking the road to the Tyrol, allowed
                    the French to effect the passage without opposition. Beaulieu attempted to make
                    a stand upon the heights between Villafranca and Vallegio; but having learned
                    the movement of Augereau on Peschiera, he immediately retired beyond the Adige,
                    and ascended the right bank by Dolce as far as Caliano. Part of his eft
                    ascending the Mincio to join him at Vallegio, came suddenly upon the French
                    head-quarters, and nearly captured the general-in-chief, but was soon dispersed
                    by the troops under Massena; and the remainder of this wing, being detached from
                    Goito, entered Mantua, the garrison of which now exceeded 13,000 men. Thus far
                    the combinations of Napoleon had been completely successful; yet whatever might
                    have been his desire to pursue the remains of Beaulieu’s army, he found it
                    necessary to stop. He was not strong enough to penetrate into the heart of the
                    Austrian states, whilst the armies of the Rhine were still behind that river;
                    besides, he had rather overrun than conquered Italy, and the possession of
                    Mantua could alone sstablish the French power in that country on a solid
                    foundation. The investment of that fortress was therefore decided on; materials
                    for the siege having previously been prepared at Alexandria and Tortona, whence
                    they were directed in all haste on Lombardy.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Napoleon took measures for strengthening himself upon the Adige, where
                    bis situation had become complicated, and in fact presented a variety of new
                    combinations. The investment of Mantua required that he should be master of the
                    course of the Adige; and the key of this river is Verona, the position of which
                    forms the basis of every system upon that line of operations. He therefore took
                    it upon him to summon the city, which was surrendered without resistance, on the
                    1st of June; and by this precious acquisition he procured three fine bridges on
                    the Adige, and a strong central position, defended by bastions, and protected by
                    two forts perched on the last slopes of the Tyrolese mountains, so as to shut up
                    hermetically the valley of the Adige on the left bank of the river. He also
                    placed garrisons in Crema, Peschiera, and other strong places belonging to the
                    Venetians; and having concluded armistices with the king of Naples and the pope,
                    occupied Leghorn, where he seized a large amount of English property and
                    merchandise. The investment of Mantua was now converted into a regular siege,
                    the labours of which were intrusted to Serurier’s division, ten thousand strong,
                    whilst the rest of the army remained in observation upon the Adige, as far as
                    the western bank of the Lago di Garda; a position in which, by concentric
                    interior movements, the whole French force might be united on either bank of the
                    Mincio, according to the manner in which the enemy might choose to develope any
                    fresh attack. The trenches were opened on the 18th of July. But a new act of the
                    drama was about to commence.</p>
                <p>The cabinet of Vienna, justly alarmed at the progress of Napoleon, had resolved
                    to check his career by opposing to him a new army and a new general. Beaulieu
                    was replaced by Wurmser, who, having set out from Manheim with twenty thousand
                    picked troops drafted from the armies on the Rhine, reached Trent towards the
                    end of July, and there found himself at the head of more than sixty thousand
                    combatants, including the powerful reinforcement he had brought along with him.
                    At this time Napoleon had not more than thirty thousand men under his immediate
                    command, and ten thousand were engaged under Serrurier in the siege. The
                    Austrians had therefore a superiority of force which seemed to insure them the
                    victory. In fact, they already triumphed in anticipation of success, and their
                    calculation seemed just; but in their estimation of the respective forces, they
                    forgot to take into account the relative values of the generals-in-chief, and
                    this slight omission disarranged all. In the last days of July, Wurmser
                    debouched from the Tyrol; Quasdanovich, with 25,000 men, moving by the left bank
                    of the Lago di Garda upon Salo and Brescia; and the marshal, with the remaining
                    35,000, descending the Adige in three columns. Experience had not yet taught the
                    Austrians the advantage of compact movements, and dearly did Wurmser pay for the
                    blunder which he committed in thus dividing his force, and exposing it to be
                    beaten in detail. Napoleon, on receiving the news of his advance, accompanied
                    with the intelligence that Sauret had been forced back on De-zenzano, and
                    Massena expelled from Rivoli, instantly resolved to attack Quasdanovich before
                    he could form a junction with Wurmser on the Mincio. This was his only chance of
                    success, and to secure it he quitted every thing. The siege of Mantua was
                    raised; a hundred and forty pieces of cannon were abandoned in the trenches;
                    and, by the evening of the 30th, Napoleon had assembled between Peschiera and
                    Goito the divisions of Massena and Augereau, with the reserve of Serrurier’s
                    division.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828543" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8543-0718"/>
                <p>Next day he passed the Mincio to encounter Quasdanovich. The Austrian general,
                    assailed by a superior force, was driven from Lonato, Brescia, and Salo, and
                    compelled to fall back on Gavardo. But this success was not decisive, and the
                    defeat of the Austrian plan of operations might have been repaired, if Wurmser
                    had passed the Mincio on the 31st of July, and occupied Lopato. By this means he
                    would have effected a junction with Quasdanovich, and Napoleon would have been
                    forced to regain in all haste the Tesino or Piacenza. But instead of following
                    the only course calculated to insure success, Wurmser proceeded to make his
                    entry into Mantua, amidst the sound of bells, and did not pass the Mincio to
                    advance upon Castiglione until the evening of the 2d of August; thus allowing
                    Napoleon time to defeat his lieutenant, and drive him from San Marco, Lonato,
                    and even Brescia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Austrians seem never to have known the value of time in war. They occasionally
                    form able plans; but it is always by the calculation of distances or of time
                    that they misgive.</p></note> On the 3d, Augereau’s division, supported by the
                    reserve, advanced upon Castiglione; that of Massena directed its march on
                    Lonato; and Guyeux received orders to débouché on Salo, in order to induce
                    Quasdanovich to continue his retreat by threatening his communications with the
                    Tyrol. Napoleon conceived that he was directing his effort against Wurmser, but,
                    on the contrary, it fell upon the left of Quasdanovich, who was now making
                    another attempt to operate his junction by Lonato, and had with this view
                    resumed the offensive, advancing, as usual, in several isolated columns. As
                    might be expected, the Austrian was again defeated, and, being warmly pursued,
                    was forced to direct his columns on their former position at Gavardo. The same
                    day Augereau attacked and defeated the advanced guard of Wurmser at Castiglione.
                    Napoleon had as yet obtained only partial successes; but they strengthened him
                    in his central position, and gave him the means of dealing heavier blows. The
                    first of these was directed against Quasdanovich, who, on the very next day, was
                    surprised at Gavardo, threatened with an attack in reverse, and obliged to fall
                    back in great disorder upon Riva; thus definitively ridding Napoleon of a corps
                    formidable from its strength, as well as from the strategic direction which had
                    been assigned to it.</p>
                <p>But if fortune seconded Napoleon in this juncture, he was at the same instant
                    exposed to the greatest danger in the midst of his very head-quarters. Massena’s
                    division had just quitted Lonato, where Napoleon remained with 1200 men, when
                    all of a sudden an alarm was given that the place had been surrounded by an
                    enemy’s corps, and soon afterwards an Austrian officer came to summon him to
                    surrender. Happily his presence of mind did not forsake him. He presumed that
                    this could only be one of the detachments of Quasdanovich which had been
                    separated from the main body in the recent affair of Lonato; and he resolved to
                    extricate himself by audacity from a situation which must have been not a little
                    embarrassing. Assuming a menacing tone, “What means this insolence ?” said he.
                    “Do you dare to beard the French general in the midst of his army ?” The
                    Austrian officer was confounded, and hearing the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >“fusillade”</hi> significantly pronounced by Napoleon, he became so terrified
                    that he consented to surrender. Two thousand men, provided with four pieces of
                    cannon, then laid down their arms, and discovered, when it was too late, that if
                    they had stood firm, the French general-in-chief and all his staff must have
                    been their prisoners. This corps formed the advanced guard of</p>
                <p>Quasdanovich, which, in executing a reconnoissance with a view to a junction with
                    Wurmser, had crossed on the march the columns of St Hilaire and Sauret, and had
                    fallen upon the French head-quarters at the very moment when the camp of Gavardo
                    was unexpectedly attacked by the French troops.</p>
                <p>The combat which decided the final success of this operation took place on the
                    5th of August, near Castiglione. Wurmser, still infected with the mania of
                    detachments, had pushed one in the direction of the Lower Po, and left another
                    to blockade Peschiera, so that there remained under his immediate orders not
                    more than 25,000 men. The divisions of Massena and Augereau, with the reserve,
                    presented a force equal to that of the enemy, and the arrival of the division of
                    Serrurier turned the balance decidedly in favour of the French. As soon as the
                    latter came up, Napoleon attacked the enemy’s left with his right and centre,
                    defeated it, and forced him to repass the Mincio with the loss of twenty pieces
                    of cannon. Massena instantly crossed the Mincio at Peschiera, and falling upon
                    the enemy’s right wing, established before that place, routed and put it to
                    flight. Wurmser now perceived that a prompt retreat could alone save him, and,
                    leaving in Mantua a garrison of 15,000 men, he fell back along the valley of the
                    Adige, warmly pursued by the French as far as the entrance of the Tyrol, which
                    he regained with a total loss of 12,000 men and fifty pieces of cannon.<note

                    defeat was that on which Prince Eugene had succeeded so well in his celebrated
                    campaign of 17θ5 against the Duke of Vendôme; and if these events be compared,
                    it will be found that Napoleon displayed more ability than the general of Louis
                    XIV. Although Vendôme bad Mantua for him, whilst Napoleon had it against him,
                    yet he had not the skill to maintain himself on the Adige and the Mincio, and
                    allowed himself to be assailed on the left by Prince Eugene, who transported his
                    infantry in boats by the Lago di Garda to Gavardo. This movement lasted six
                    days; but in half that time Napoleon would have destroyed an army which ventured
                    to perform such an operation in his presence.</p></note></p>
                <p>The Austrians, however, had scarcely re-entered the Tyrol, when, being joined by
                    considerable reinforcements, they once more found themselves stronger than their
                    adversaries. It was easy to foresee that they would not suffer Napoleon quietly
                    to effect the reduction of Mantua; and Wurmser, having received positive orders
                    to relieve that place, imagined that he could attain this end without fighting,
                    by means of manoeuvres alone. Davidowich was to cover the Tyrol with 20,000 men
                    disseminated from the environs of Feldkirch as far as Roveredo; whilst Wurmser
                    himself, with the remaining 26,000, should descend the valley of the Brenta, to
                    débouché on Porto-Legnago and the rear of the French army. The Austrian genera),
                    who supposed that Napoleon’s views were as narrow as his own, conceived that his
                    adversary had no other course to follow but to retire behind the Mincio, and
                    that he would thus become the deliverer of Mantua by the sole effect of his
                    combinations. But the young chief of the French army was not the man to allow
                    himself to be deceived by false demonstrations. At the moment when Wurmser was
                    meditating this false movement, Napoleon received a reinforcement of6000 men
                    from the army of the Alps, and being thus strengthened, he resolved to penetrate
                    into the heart of the Tyrol, and to fall upon the right of Wurmser at the moment
                    when he was draining the Tyrol in order to manoeuvre by his left. He directed on
                    Roveredo the divisions of Augereau and Massena posted at Verona and, at Rivoli,
                    and these were to be joined on the march by the division of Vaubois, debouching
                    from Salo by the western bank of the Lago di Garda; a force which could scarcely
                    fail to overpower the corps of Davidowich, left alone to guard the Tyrol, and
                    dispersed in several detachments. On the 4th of September, Wukassowich, who
                    commanded his advanced guard, was expelled from the camp at Mori, and driven
                    back, first on Roveredo, and then on Calliano, where he formed a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193828556" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8556-0719"/>junction with the mass of the
                    corps. The position of Calliano seemed inexpugnable; but Davidowich, being
                    attacked by a greatly superior force, was compelled to abandon this redoubtable
                    gorge, leaving in the hands of the assailants twenty-five guns and two thousand
                    prisoners. The Austrians retreated in the greatest disorder, and next day the
                    French entered Trent. Meanwhile Davidowich rallied the remains of his corps
                    behind the Lavis; Napoleon, however, resolved to dislodge him; he was attacked
                    by Vaubois, and having in vain attempted to defend the passage of the river, he
                    was thrown back upon Salurn and Neumarck.</p>
                <p>In the course of this victorious march, Napoleon learned the movement of Wurmser
                    on the Brenta; but, far from being intimidated by it, he judged rightly that it
                    would become to him a more certain pledge of victory. An army divided into two,
                    with its centre penetrated, its right overthrown, and its left at once isolated
                    and turned; what more could he desire? The occupation of Trent was the more
                    important that, in opening to the French the head of the valley of the Brenta,
                    it also uncovered the rear of Wurmser. Napoleon was not the man to let slip so
                    favourable an opportunity. He resolved at once to profit by the false movement
                    of the enemy, and not to allow him time to destroy the troops that remained
                    before Mantua. On the 6th he directed Massena and Augereau by Levicoin the
                    valley of the Brenta, in order to mask his own movement, and keep Davidowich in
                    check; whilst Vaubois was left upon the Lavis. On the morning of the 7th the
                    advanced guard of Augereau encountered and overthrew a strong detachment of the
                    enemy, posted at Primo-lano to guard the passage of the gorges of the Brenta,
                    and which, being pursued by a regiment of dragoons, was overtaken and obliged to
                    surrender. Wurmser had already attained Bassano, where, finding that Napoleon
                    was marching upon his communications, and not knowing whether to advance or
                    retreat, he took up a position on the heights in advance of the town, placing
                    his van-guard at Solagna and Campo-Lungo. Here the latter was attacked, on the
                    morning of the 8th of September, and driven back in disorder on Bassano. The
                    French instantly pursued, and reaching the town close on the heels of the
                    fugitives, carried it by main force. Not knowing where to make head, Wurmser,
                    with the left of his <hi rend="italic">corps</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    bataille,</hi> retired on Fonteriva, where he passed the Brenta, and took the
                    direction of Vicenza; whilst Quasdanovich, with the right, finding it impossible
                    to gain the Brenta, fell back upon Friuli. In this affair, two thousand
                    prisoners, thirty pieces of cannon, and an immense quantity of baggage, fell
                    into the hands of the French. The situation of Wurmser seemed desperate. His
                    communications with Austria were intercepted; he had lost the greater part of
                    his artillery and baggage; and he now found himself in a country, all the
                    outlets of which were in the hands of the enemy, with little more than 14,000
                    men, discouraged by repeated discomfitures. Nothing, therefore, remained for him
                    but to endeavour, at any sacrifice, to throw himself into Mantua, and there
                    await the arrival of fresh succours from Austria; and such, accordingly, was the
                    resolution adopted by the gallant veteran, who, though outwitted and
                    out-generalled, was not dispirited by defeat.</p>
                <p>But to accomplish this object, it became necessary to force a passage somewhere
                    on the Adige; and the Austrian general, having lost his pontoon train, seemed
                    destitute of all means of escape, and about to be overwhelmed by the forces
                    skilfully directed to prevent his escape. A mistake committed by Sahaguet,
                    however, proved the means of his salvation. That officer, who was at Castellano,
                    had received positive orders to cut down all the bridges of the Molinélla, and
                    to avail himself of this obstacle to arrest the enemy; but, happily for the
                    Austrian, he forgot’ that of Villa Impinta, by which Wufmser was enabled to
                    escape the certain destruction that awaited him, and, after a series of bloody
                    skirmishes, in which fortune divided her favours pretty equally, to throw
                    himself into Mantua.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Napoleon never forgave Sahaguet for this oversight, which deprived him of
                    one of the fairest fruits of his victory of Bassano⅛ His plan had been so ably
                    formed, that, but for Sahaguet’s blunder, the destruction of Wurmser would have
                    been inevitable.</p></note> He had flattered himself with appearing before that
                    fortress at the héad of 26,000 victorious troops; but in reality he threw
                    himself into the place with no more than 12,000 men, discouraged by defeat, and,
                    instead of raising the siege, about to be themselves invested. At first he
                    encamped his troops without the place, between the suburb of St George and the
                    citadel, in the hope of keeping the field, and collecting supplies from the
                    country; and, in this position, some partial advantages obtained over the troops
                    of Sahaguet and Massena, on the 13th and 14th, inspired him with a security
                    which Napoleon lost no time in punishing. The entire garrison having sallied out
                    to forage on the 15th, Napoleon attacked them with his whole force; penetrated
                    as far as St George, which he carried at the point of the bayonet; and having
                    compelled Wurmser to retire within the body of the place, completed the
                    investment of the city and the fortress. The charge of the blockade was
                    intrusted to General Kilmaine, with Serrurier’s division, and the rest of the
                    army were placed in observation before the Tyrol.</p>
                <p>The position ofNapoleon, however, was by no means without difficulty, to say
                    nothing of danger. The defeat of the French armies of the Rhine rendered it
                    highly probable that Austria would reinforce her army in the Tyrol and in
                    Friuli, and make fresh efforts to deliver Mantua; Wurmser was in his rear, at
                    the head of an army of more than 20,000 men; the French troops were established
                    in a marshy country, where malignant fevers usually prevail in autumn; and the
                    political horizon of the south of Italy began to assume a very threatening
                    aspect. On the other hand, in order to strengthen the French interest, new
                    republics were founded; the pope, through the interference of Spain, was
                    prevented from throwing himself into the arms of Austria; peace was concluded
                    with Naples; a treaty was concluded with Genoa, which had agreed to shut its
                    port against the English; and the French party had triumphed in Corsica. To
                    counterbalance these advantages, the epidemic fevers had encumbered the
                    hospitals, diminishing considerably the number of combatants; reinforcements
                    arrived too slowly to repair the losses which had been sustained; and the
                    Austrians were actively preparing once more to try the fortune of arms. By the
                    middle of October, Davidowich had received reinforcements which raised the force
                    of his corps to 20,000 men; that of Quasdanovich now amounted to 25,000
                    combatants; and the Croats were permanently organised into regiments, to
                    facilitate the arrival of the levies drawn from the Tyrol, and the recruits
                    raised in the interior. The supreme command was conferred on General Alvinzi, a
                    veteran of high reputation, who, having joined the corps of Davidowich, resumed
                    the offensive, directing that corps by Bassano on Verona, where he hoped to
                    effect a junction with Davidowich, who had received orders to descend the
                    Adige.</p>
                <p>Napoleon’s situation had thus become extremely critical. He could not advance to
                    encounter Alvinzi without abandoning Verona, and consequently enabling
                    Davidowich to overthrow Vaubois, unite with Wurmser under Mantua, and thus
                    establish in his rear an army superior in number to all the troops he had been
                    able to collect. On <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828569"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8569-0720"/>the other hand, he could not concentrate the mass
                    of his force on Roveredo without opening to Alvinzi the road to Mantua, which,
                    in an inverse sense, would have led to the same results. There was also an
                    inconvenience in assembling the mass of his troops at Verona, since in this case
                    the communication between Alvinzi and Davidowich would have been re-established
                    by the valley of the Brenta. Nevertheless, as it had become almost equally
                    necessary to prevent the junction of these two generals, and to oppose the union
                    of one of them with Wurmser, the adoption of a mean term, or intermediate plan,
                    was the only course that remained open to Napoleon.</p>
                <p>Vaubois was too weak to defend the approach to Trent; but, in ordering him to
                    assume the offensive, Napoleon hoped to impose on Davidowich. In this, however,
                    he was deceived. On the 3d of November Vaubois was forced to fall back on
                    Calliano; on the 4th Davidowich entered Trent; and on the same day the army of
                    Alvinzi arrived at Citadella and Bassano. At the approach <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the enemy Massena fell back on Montebello. Davidowich now marched on
                    Calliano, and Alvinzi prepared to move upon Verona by Vicenza. Napoleon now
                    decided to repeat from right to left the manoeuvre which had succeeded against
                    Wurnι-ser from left to right; that is, after first trying to defeat Alvinzi, and
                    drive him behind the Piave, he proposed to ascend the Brenta, in order to fall
                    upon the rear of Davidowich. With the divisions of Augereau and Massena he
                    advanced towards the Brenta, which the enemy had already passed, and on the 6th
                    attacked their left under Provera at Carmagnano, and their right under
                    Quasdanovich at Lenove, though with only partial success. Provera repassed the
                    Brenta, and Q,uasdanovich withdrew to Bassano, without suffering any serious
                    loss. Meanwhile Vaubois, being warmly pressed on the Adige, was, after two days’
                    fighting, driven from the strong position of Calliano, and obliged to retreat on
                    La Corona. Napoleon flew to this division, harangued the 39th and 85th
                    regiments, which had given way at Calliano, and threatened to inscribe on their
                    colours that they were no longer worthy to belong to the army of Italy. Moved
                    with these reproaches, the soldiers shed tears, and swore to conquer or die when
                    next led against the enemy. Napoleon, however, found it necessary to renounce
                    his projects, and to retire on Verona, where he established the head-quarters of
                    the army. The whole country between the Brenta and the Adige being now in the
                    hands of the enemy, the French general began to be closely pressed, and, not
                    choosing to be more so, resolved once more to fall upon Alvinzi. On the 11th he
                    left Verona with the divisions of Massena and Augereau, and next day attacked
                    the enemy, whom he found in position at Caldiero. But a violent tempest which
                    beat in the faces of the troops, and the strong position of the enemy, rendered
                    all his efforts unavailing; he was repulsed with loss, and forced to return to
                    Verona, where his situation now became more critical than ever. He was
                    everywhere too weak; and the fortune which had hitherto so signally befriended
                    him, seemed at length to abandon her favourite. Any other general, in his
                    circumstances, would have thought only of repassing the Mincio, and would thus
                    have lost Italy. But in war it often happens, that to gain all, a general must
                    risk all. Reduced to this predicament, Napoleon determined to pass the Adige
                    below the left of Alvinzi, and thus to act on his rear. The project was
                    hazardous in itself; but it was nevertheless wise, because it was the only one
                    which still left him some chance of success.</p>
                <p>General Alvinzi, in presenting himself before Verona by the Caldiero road, had on
                    his right impracticable mountains, on his left the Adige, and in front a place
                    secure against a <hi rend="italic">coup-de-main.</hi> The ground which he
                    occupied, being thus closed upon three sides, had no other outlet than the
                    defile of Villa Nova, by which alone he could retire in the event of defeat. By
                    passing to Ronco, Napoleon would therefore approach this defile, oblige the
                    enemy to fight <hi rend="italic">face</hi><hi rend="italic">en arrière,</hi> in
                    order to open a passage, and place his inferior army on marshy ground, traversed
                    by three dikes, where he would have all the advantage of the defensive, joined
                    to the individual superiority of his soldiers. It has indeed been said, that by
                    passing at Albaredo, Napoleon would have avoided the Alpon, its marshes, and the
                    defile of Arcole; and it is certainly true that he would thus have more easily
                    gained Villa Nova, which was the great object of his movement. But he was not
                    strong enough to throw himself headlong on the only road of Alvinzi; all he
                    could do was to menace this communication, without quitting], the support of the
                    Adige, and at the same time approaching as quickly as possible to Verona and the
                    division of Vaubois. The movement on Albaredo would have been too wide to
                    accomplish this triple object; and besides, it would have been too hazardous to
                    offer battle on the Alpon at Villa Nova, facing to the rear in the direction of
                    Verona. The project which he actually executed was sufficiently daring, inasmuch
                    as the unsafe nature of the ground, and the narrowness of the dikes, by which
                    alone he could advance on Arcole, rendered victory difficult, whilst a serious
                    reverse would have decided the fate of the campaign, and that of Italy.</p>
                <p>Having recalled Kilmaine with two thousand men from the blockade of Mantua,
                    Napoleon confided to him the defence of Verona, which it was the more
                    indispensable to maintain, as it barred the passage of the Adige, and prevented
                    Alvinzi from giving his hand to Davidowich; and on the night of the 14th of
                    November, he set out from Verona for Ronco, where he threw a bridge over the
                    Adige. On the 15th he passed the river, with the divisions of Massena and
                    Augereau,and the reserve of cavalry, forming in all about 20,000 men, and
                    advanced by the three dikes which conduct to Arcole. A brigade of Croats,
                    however, profiting by the advantages of the ground, repulsed the attack of
                    Augereau, whose column had been directed on the bridge of Arcole, and afforded
                    time to Alvinzi to come to their assistance. The latter also sent Provera with
                    six battalions to attack Massena at Porcil, and with the mass of his army
                    retrograded on St Bonifacio. But this unforeseen obstacle did not discourage
                    Napoleon. Perceiving that if he could not attain Villa Nova by the left bank of
                    the Alpon, he might act more directly by Porcil on Alvinzi’s line of retreat,
                    and sensible that, with this view, as well as to secure his right,
                    andpreventhimself from being taken in a <hi rend="italic">cul-de-sac,</hi> it
                    had become absolutely necessary to make himself master of the village and defile
                    of Arcole, he made fresh efforts to carry the bridge. The greater part of his
                    generals being wounded, he seized a standard, and urged his grenadiers once more
                    to the charge. They advanced boldly amidst a tremendous fire; but the head of
                    the column being shattered, the troops gave way, and Napoleon being thrown into
                    the marsh, was in imminent danger of being taken. At this critical moment
                    Belliard charged with a company of grenadiers, and rescued the general-in-chief,
                    when about to fall into the hands of the enemy. Nevertheless, towards evening,
                    the Austrians abandoned Arcole, on the approach of a brigade which had passed
                    the Adige at the ferry of Albaredo, and was advancing along the left bank of the
                    Alpon. But it was now too late; and Napoleon, not choosing to run the risk of
                    passing the night with his troops crowded in the marshes, in presence of the
                    hostile army deployed between St Bonifacio and San Stephano, and fell back to
                    Ronco, on the right bank of the Adige.</p>
                <p>The combat of the second day proved not more decisive than that of the first. It,
                    was maintained with equal bravery on both sides; and in the evening, Napoleon,
                    from the same motives as before, repassed the Adige. But the third conflict
                    proved decisive. At daybreak on the 17th, the French <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193828582" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8582-0721"/>troops resumed their march to
                    the bridge, and drove back the Austrians on Porcil and Arcole. It was not
                    against this point, however, that Napoleon had resolved to direct his principal
                    efforts. Leaving Robert with a demi-brigade to keep the enemy in check, he
                    therefore directed Massena with another demi-brigade on Porcil, whilst the rest
                    of his division remained in reserve near the bridge; and he ordered Augereau to
                    throw a bridge over the Alpon, near the embouchure of the rivulet, so as to be
                    in a condition to act against the Austrian left, and thus take Arcole in
                    reverse. As Napoleon had foreseen, the Austrians, reinforced at Arcole, assumed
                    the offensive, and drove back Robert, whom they pursued with reckless
                    impetuosity. Proud of this success, their deep column continued to advance, and
                    suddenly came upon the main body of Massena’s division, placed in ambuscade
                    amongst some willows, who instantly assailed them in flank, cut off three
                    thousand men, and forced the remainder to retire in disorder on Arcole. The
                    decisive moment had now arrived. Augereau developed his attack, whilst some
                    cavalry appeared on the enemy’s flank; Massena debouched by Arcole and St
                    Gregorio; the little garrison of Legnago threatened the enemy’s rear; and the
                    latter, unable to maintain themselves in ground favourable for acting on the
                    defensive, were reduced to the alternative of either accepting battle in an open
                    country, or commencing a precipitate retreat. Alvinzi durst not risk the former,
                    and on the 18th he retired on Montebello, leaving Napoleon at perfect liberty to
                    turn upon Davidowich.</p>
                <p>This general, who, during eight days, had amused himself before the intrenchments
                    of La Corona, at length attacked Vaubois on the 16th. The latter maintained his
                    ground, but the following day retired behind the Mincio at Peschiera. On the
                    18th Davidowich advanced to Castel Novo. Resolved to punish him for this rash
                    movement, Napoleon sent only the reserve of cavalry in pursuit of Alvinzi, and
                    with the main body of his infantry fell back from Villa Nova upon Verona, which
                    he entered in triumph. He then directed the divisions of Massena and Vaubois to
                    attack Davidowich in front, whilst Augereau advanced from Verona upon Dolce to
                    cut off his retreat; a combination which would have insured his destruction, had
                    he not accidentally learned the defeat of Alvinzi, and hastened to regain
                    Rovercdo, which he effected with much difficulty, and the loss of his
                    rear-guard. Alvinzi, on his side, seeing himself followed only by cavalry,
                    returned to Villa Nova; but as Napoleon had already disposed of Davidowich, and
                    was now preparing to débouché once more by Verona on the left bank of the Adige,
                    the Austrian, separated from his lieutenant, did not venture to keep the field,
                    and immediately fell back behind the Brenta. Meanwhile Wurmser remained quietly
                    in Mantua. Alvinzi, in commencing his operations, had calculated that he could
                    not appear before Mantua until the 23d of November, and had engaged Wurmser not
                    to make any sortie until that day. But things not having turned out as the enemy
                    had hoped, this projected effort proved fruitless. Kilmaine had already returned
                    with his detachment, and the corps employed in the blockade succeeded without
                    difficulty in repulsing the besieged. The rapid combinations of Napoleon had
                    thus rendered abortive all the efforts of Austria; a fourth army had been
                    baffled; and for two months after the last day of Arcole, the French general
                    remained undisputed master of Lombardy. To him this interval was of great
                    importance, as it enabled him to take the necessary measures for consolidating
                    his conquests, and also to procure reinforcements sufficient not only to put him
                    in a condition to maintain himself, but also to insure the fall of Wurmser, and
                    to strike a blow at the very heart of the Austrian monarchy.</p>
                <p>All that Napoleon had yet done seemed like the web of Penelope; it was invariably
                    undone by the constancy with which the cabinet of Vienna reinforced its army of
                    Italy, and by the negligence of the Directory, which had so long delayed to
                    afford him adequate support. In fact, he was treated by the government of France
                    as Hannibal had been by the senate of Carthage. But public opinion forbade the
                    sacrifice of a general and an army that had gained so many victories; and, as
                    the battles of Arcolc showed that both were within a hair’s breadth of being
                    expelled from Italy, it was at length resolved to adopt decisive measures.
                    Accordingly, the fine divisions of Bernadotte and Delmas, drawn from the armies
                    of the Rhine, were, notwithstanding the winter, directed across the Alps, and,
                    on joining the French army, would have made its total strength about 75,000 men.
                    On the other hand, by the end of December, Alvinzi having under his orders
                    upwards of 40,000 men, resolved to descend from the mountains, and make another
                    effort for the relief of Mantua. For the fourth time, therefore, the possession
                    of that important place was to be submitted to the arbitrement of arms.</p>
                <p>Whilst waiting the arrival of the reinforcements which he expected from the
                    Rhine, Napoleon, apprized that Alvinzi had assumed the offensive, flew to the
                    Adige, to watch the development of his attack. At this moment the division of
                    Serrurier was before Mantua; that of Augereau occupied the line of the Adige
                    from Verona to Legnago and beyond it; Massena was at Verona; and Joubert, with a
                    fourth division, held the important positions of La Corona and Rivoli. Each of
                    these divisions was about ten thousand strong, and Rey, with a reserve of four
                    thousand, occupied Desenzano. The imperialists, as if determined to profit by no
                    lesson, advanced at once on the centre and the two wings of the French army, by
                    Roveredo, Vicenza, and Padua; but Napoleon, as he had not yet ascertained in
                    which of these three directions Alvinzi was carrying the mass of his force,
                    resolved to keep his positions until the Austrian general had developed his
                    projects. On the 12th of January 1797, the column which advanced by Vicenza
                    approached Verona, and drove in the advanced posts of Massena. But the division
                    of that general having debouched on St Michel, the enemy was repulsed with loss;
                    and Napoleon acquired the certainty that he was not in force upon that point.
                    Next day, however, he received intelligence that Joubert, pressed in front by
                    superior forces, and threatened by strong columns on his two flanks, had been
                    obliged in the morning to evacuate the position of La Corona, and to fall back
                    on Rivoli, whence he reckoned on continuing his retreat on Castel Novo. All
                    doubt as to the enemy’s projects was now at an end. It was clear that the column
                    of Vicenza, and that which directed its march on the Lower Adige, were only
                    diversions to facilitate the march of the principal corps, which was advancing
                    by the valley of the Adige. The great object of Napoleon, therefore, was to beat
                    this corps, by attacking it with the main body of his army. He instantly set out
                    from Verona, with the greater part of Massena’s division, leaving two thousand
                    men to keep in check the column of Vicenza; and at the same time he sent orders
                    to Rey to advance from Salo on Rivoli, where he had resolved to assemble the
                    mass <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his force. As Alvinzi had not only weakened
                    himself by the corps directed on Verona and Legnago, but had even disseminated
                    the troops under his immediate orders, Napoleon saw that, by occupying the
                    plateau of Rivoli, where the*different paths which traverse that mountainous
                    country imite, he would gain the advantage of acting in a mass against columns
                    separated from one another by insurmountable obstacles. With this view, he sent
                    orders to Joubert to maintain himself, at any sacrifice, in advance of Rivoli
                    until his arrival.</p>
                <p>When these orders reached Joubert, however, he was in full retreat; but he
                    instantly countermarched his division, and regained the position of Rivoli,
                    which the enemy had <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828595"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8595-0722"/>not yet had time to occupy. Soon after midnight
                    Napoleon arrived. It was a fine clear moonlight, and by the enemy’s watch-fires,
                    which illuminated the white peaks of Montebaldo, he could easily distinguish
                    five separate encampments. On the morning of the 14th he made his dispositions
                    for battle, and commenced the attack by directing Joubert against the Austrian
                    centre, whilst a demi-brigade was detached to keep in check Lusignan. The enemy
                    sustained the shock with great firmness, and, becoming the assailant in his
                    turn, forced Joubert to give way; Vial, who commanded the right, also
                    retrograded; and the plateau seemed about to be carried. At this critical moment
                    Napoleon, favoured by the vigorous stand made by one of his regiments in the
                    centre, flew to the left, whither he directed the column of Massena, which had
                    just arrived; the enemy were repulsed, and the French left established itself on
                    the heights of Trombalora. The danger, however, was not yet past. The right was
                    warmly pursued by the Austrians, who had descended from the heights of San
                    Marco; Quasdanovich, having forced the intrenchments of Osteria, was also
                    beginning to ascend the plateau of Rivoli; and Lusignan was moving by Affi upon
                    the rear of the French. Napoleon was, in fact, surrounded; but an instant’s
                    reflection convinced him, that if he could overpower Quasdanovich, he would have
                    nothing to fear from Lusignan, and that matters might easily be re-established
                    on the right. This intuitive judgment decided the fortune of the day. As soon as
                    the head of Q,uasdanovich’s column appeared on the plateau, it was assailed on
                    both flanks by the infantry, and in front by the cavalry under Lasalle; and
                    being forced back into the ravine, it was thrown into complete disorder by the
                    explosion of an ammunition waggon in the midst of the troops when crowded
                    together in the hollow. Confusion and terror reigned supreme; infantry, cavalry,
                    artillery, fled pell-mell by Canale. Having thus got rid of Quasdanovich,
                    Napoleon directed his efforts to support Vial, who was now in full retreat. The
                    Austrians, pursuing with headlong impetuosity, had got into disorder, when a
                    charge of two hundred horse completed the confusion; the panic communicated
                    itself to the centre, which immediately disbanded; and it was only behind the
                    Tasso that Alvinzi succeeded in rallying the fugitivès. The fate of Lusignan was
                    now sealed. Attacked by Massena in front and by Rey in the rear, his corps was
                    destroyed, and he regained Montebaldo with only a few hundred men.</p>
                <p>On the evening of the battle, however, Napoleon learned that Provera, having
                    forced the centre of Augereau’s division, scattered along the Adige, had
                    succeeded in passing the river at Anghiari on the 13th, and was directing his
                    march on Mantua. On the 14th the Austrian general was at Nogara, and on the 15th
                    he arrived before Mantua, into which he hoped to make good his entrance by the
                    suburb of St George. But finding it retrenched and occupied by the besiegers, he
                    next day attacked the post of La Favorita, whilst Wurmser sallied out against
                    that of San Antonio. Serrurier, however, succeeded in maintaining his ground;
                    Wurmser retired into the body of the place; and Provera, assailed on all sides
                    by the forces which Napoleon had promptly directed against him, was forced to
                    lay down his arms. Meanwhile Joubert, acting with equal vigour, pursued Alvinzi
                    without intermission, turned both his flanks, and getting upon his line of
                    retreat, made 5000 prisoners. Having lost half his army, the Austrian general
                    now withdrew the remainder behind the Piave, leaving only 8000 men for the
                    defence of the Tyrol; and the French army resumed the positions which it had
                    occupied before the combats of Arcole. Such, then, was the famous battle of
                    Rivoli, in which Napoleon, with only thirty thousand men, made twenty thousand
                    prisoners. But its most important result was the capitulation of Mantua, which
                    surrendered on the 2d of February, thus rendering the French undisputed masters
                    of Lombardy. The terms granted to Wurmser were much more favourable than he had
                    any reason to expect, with a garrison reduced to the last extremity, and
                    suffering from almost every species of privation and misery.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>At the time of the surrender,
                    the garrison, though much weakened by disease, amounted still to 13,000 men
                    under arms, who were declared prisoners of war, and sent to Trieste, to be there
                    exchanged. In Mantua, Napoleon found the battering train which he had abandoned
                    in the trenches at the epoch of .Castiglione, and 350 pieces of cannon on the
                    ramparts or in the arsenal.</p><p>On this occasion the French general acted with
                    equal delicacy and generosity towards his gallant but unfortunate adversary.
                    When the aged veteran came out to surrender his sword, he found only Serrurier
                    ready to receive it, Napoleon having generously avoided being present to witness
                    his humiliation. The terms granted to Wurmser were also more favourable than the
                    Directory approved. But the victorious general treated their remonstrances with
                    scorn. “I have granted the Austrian,” said he, in reply to their expostulations,
                    “such terms as were, in my judgment, due to a brave and honourable enemy, and to
                    the dignity of the French republic.” This is one of the most pleasing traits in
                    his history, and gives a favourable impression of the natural character of the

                <p>Whilst Napoleon was at blows with Alvinzi, the court of Rome, seduced by the
                    instigations of Austria, had broken the armistice concluded in the month of June
                    immediately preceding, and raised a considerable body of troops, the command of
                    which was intrusted to General Colli, whom the cabinet of Vienna had sent for
                    the purpose. Thinking it necessary to punish this hostile demonstration, partly
                    as an example to others, and partly also to get rid of an enemy seldom dangerous
                    but always inconvenient, Napoleon formed a division, which he placed under the
                    command of Victor, and directed to march upon Imola in the Romagna, where it
                    arrived on the 2d of February, the very day on which Mantua capitulated. The
                    campaign was neither long nor bloody. A corps of 4000 papal troops, which
                    attempted to defend the Senio, was totally routed; Faenza was carried at the
                    point of the bayonet; and Colli, with about 3000 men, were made prisoners. On
                    the 9th Victor arrived at Ancona, where he compelled 1200 men to lay down their
                    arms; on the 10th his van-guard entered Loretto, and rifled the treasury of the
                    Santa Casa; and by the 18th he had reached Tolentino, where his progress was
                    stopped by the conclusion of peace. The terms were such as Napoleon thought fit
                    to dictate. The pope confirmed the cession of Avignon, the Comtat, and the
                    legations of Ferrara and Bologna; he also ceded the Romagna, obliged himself to
                    pay a contribution of L. 1,200,000, and agreed to execute, in the fullest
                    manner, the provisions of Bologna respecting works of art. These stipulations
                    were too harsh not to render the holy see an irreconcilable enemy; but they were
                    not severe enough to deprive it of all means of future hostility.</p>
                <p>The splendid victory gained at Rivoli, the surrender of Mantua, the evacuation of
                    Corsica by the English, the peace with Naples and Rome, and the approach of
                    powerful reinforcements, having completely changed the face of affairs in Italy,
                    Napoleon, being now definitively assured of that country, hastened to carry the
                    war into the hereditary dominions of Austria. The divisions drawn from the army
                    of the Rhine having arrived in the course of the month of March, he found
                    himself at the head of 75,000 veteran troops; but of this number he was obliged
                    to detach about 20,000 to garrison strong places, and to observe the southern
                    part of the peninsula. With the remainder, however, he resolved to advance
                    against the enemy; and the Directory, with a view to second him, ordered Moreau
                    to repass the Rhine at Kehl, whilst Hoche, after re-organizing the army of the
                    Sambre and Meuse, should again advance upon the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193828608" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8608-0723"/>Meyn. The cabinet of Vienna
                    had entertained the idea of carrying the theatre of the war into Italy; but it
                    was not till after the capture of Kehl by the Archduke Charles, and the disaster
                    of Alvinzi at Rivoli, that it was resolved to act upon this principle.
                    Accordingly, about the middle of January, the archduke, who had just
                    distinguished himself by a masterly campaign, set out with three divisions of
                    chosen troops, to traverse the Tyrol, and to oppose the conqueror of Italy.
                    Meanwhile, as the divisions of Bernadotte and Delmas had actually joined the
                    French army, whilst the Austrian reinforcements were as yet only traversing
                    Bavaria, Napoleon, finding himself ready to take the field before the enemy,
                    resolved to profit by this advantage, anticipate his adversary, and attack him
                    <hi rend="italic">à outrance,</hi> before his whole force should be assembled.
                    Having arranged his plan of operations, and recalled Victor from Ancona to the
                    Adige in order to cover his communications, he put his army in motion on the
                    10th of March, and with the mass of his force advanced towards the
                    Tagliamento.</p>
                <p>To give the details of the sixth campaign, which now commenced, would only be to
                    repeat the story which has already been five times told. The archduke, fettered,
                    it is said, by the aulic council, found himself obliged to execute a plan which
                    he had judgment enough to condemn; in other words, to repeat the error, which
                    had so often proved fatal, of acting on a double line of operations. But there
                    is no reason to believe that he was thus trammelled by any preconcerted plan.
                    His first interest was to avoid a decisive battle before the arrival of those
                    reinforcements which were marching to join him; and upon this principle all his
                    movements were regulated. On the other hand, the plan of Napoleon had for its
                    main object to force him, at all hazards, to fight, or so to cripple him that
                    the arrival of the divisions from the Rhine would have no material effect upon
                    the results of the campaign. In order to attain this end, he had the choice of
                    two lines of operations; one to the north, by the valley of the Adige or the
                    Tyrol; and the other to the east, by Friuli and Carniola. Both of these lines,
                    which form a right angle having its vertex at Verona, were occupied by the
                    Austrians; but Napoleon preferred the latter for various reasons, more
                    especially because, if the enemy should attempt to defend Friuli behind the
                    parallel positions of the Piave, the Tagliamento, and the Isonzo, his right
                    wing, in rear of which was his only line of retreat, might be turned by the
                    coast, and his army defeated and driven into the Adriatic. This consideration
                    alone determined the choice of Napoleon. Besides, as the reinforcements from the
                    Rhine had not yet joined, the Austrian army did not exceed 35,000 men; whilst
                    Napoleon had under his immediate command 38,000, supported by three divisions
                    under Joubert amounting to 17,000 men.</p>
                <p>As already mentioned, Napoleon put his army in motion on the 10th of March, and
                    advanced straight towards the Tagliamento, whilst Massena was directed to move
                    on Feltre, in order to push the brigade <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Lusignan, left
                    in observation on the Piave, and also to menace the right of the archduke. This
                    secondary movement was immediately successful. Lusignan retired, ascending the
                    Piave; but on the 13th, his rear-guard, being overtaken at Longaro, was
                    overpowered, and the general himself made prisoner. Satisfied with having thrown
                    the Austrian brigade on Cadore, Massena now directed his march on Spilimbcrgo
                    and Gemona, in order more effectually to turn the Austrian right, and occupy the
                    important route of Poteba, of which the enemy might take advantage in order to
                    retire upon Villach. On the 16th Napoleon arrived at Valvasone, on the
                    Tagliamento. The archduke had already commenced his retreat, leaving only a
                    rear-guard on the Tagliamento.</p>
                <p>But the river being fordable, the French columns rushed into the stream,
                    overthrew the enemy, and pursued them along the road leading to Palmanova.
                    Prince Charles having now divided his army, he himself fell back on Goriza; one
                    of his columns, commanded by Gontreuil and Bayalitsch, with the greater part of
                    the matériel, moved by Cividale and the valley of Natisono upon Caporetto; and
                    Ocksay, with the brigade of Lusignan, covered the road from Villach to
                    Chiusa-Veneta. But the Isonzo, from its source as far as Goriza, flows between
                    two chains of mountains which are nearly impassable on the side of Krainburg.
                    Napoleon, therefore, manoeuvred against the left flank of the archduke, with the
                    view of throwing him back into the valley of the Isonzo, where his army would
                    have found themselves in the Caudine Forks; and, for a moment, he entertained
                    some hope of accomplishing his object. The left of the enemy was covered by the
                    town of Gradisea, occupied by four battalions. On the 17th Bernadotte attacked
                    the place in front; whilst Serrurier, passing the Isonzo between the city and
                    Montefalcone, took it in reverse, and forced the garrison to capitulate.
                    Directing Guyeux by Cividale on Caporetto, Napoleon now ascended the left bank
                    of the Isonzo, for the purpose of cutting off the enemy from the road of
                    Czernita, or obliging him to plunge into the valley of the Isonzo by Canale. But
                    as soon as the French general had developed his movement, the archduke fell
                    back, in all haste, upon Laybach, taking the road by Czernita and Adelsberg,
                    closely followed by Bernadotte. Disappointed in one object, Napoleon instantly
                    turned his attention to another, and directed all his efforts against the column
                    of Gontreuil and Bayalitsch, which, being headed by Massena at Tarvis, was
                    thrown back into the gorges of Oberpreth, and being there surrounded, was forced
                    to lay down its arms. On this occasion, 4000 prisoners, twenty-five pieces of
                    cannon, and 400 baggage waggons, fell into the hands of the conquerors.</p>
                <p>From Laybach the archduke had marched by Klagenfurth on St Veit, where he was
                    joined by the first of the reinforcements sent from Germany; but not believing
                    himself even yet in a condition to deliver battle, he fell back upon Neumarck,
                    and on the 30th Napoleon arrived at St Veit. On the 2d of April Massena forced
                    the gorges of Dirnstein, and at Neumarck and Hundsmarck defeated the enemy’s
                    rear-guard, consisting of the grenadiers who had just arrived from the Rhine.
                    The archduke continued his retreat on Vienna, and on the 5th Napoleon arrived at
                    Judenburg. But the contest had now reached its term. Two days afterwards, the
                    Austrians, who had received instructions from Vienna touching a letter which
                    Napoleon had addressed to Prince Charles from Klagenfurth, manifesting a desire
                    of accommodation, demanded an armistice, with a view to treat of the
                    preliminaries of peace. To this proposal Napoleon gladly consented. His position
                    was in fact more brilliant than solid. He had not sufficient force to strike a
                    decisive blow against the Austrian monarchy; the armies of the Rhine,
                    notwithstanding the superiority which they had acquired since the departure of
                    the archduke, still remained inactive in their cantonments; he could not for a
                    long time hope for any effectual co-operation on their part; a suspicion even
                    crossed his mind that the government wished to sacrifice him, by causing him to
                    be beaten; and, besides all this, he had just cause of disquiet in regard to his
                    communications, which were seriously endangered by an alarming insurrection in
                    his rear. In these circumstances, the negociations speedily advanced towards a
                    favourable issue; and, on the 18th of April 1797, the preliminaries of peace
                    were signed at Leoben, to which the French head-quarters had been
                    transferred.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The views
                    of Napoleon, on this occasion, were admirably seconded by the cabinet of Vienna;
                    and the precipitation it displayed in the negociations disclosed the terror
                    which his successes had inspired. With his characteristic penetration, he
                    availed himself of the anxiety thus manifested to dictate the law in regard to
                    the provisional treaty.</p></note></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828621" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8621-0724"/>
                <p>The conclusion of peace with Austria was almost immediately followed by the
                    annihilation of the republic of Venice. The government of that state had done
                    every thing to call down the vengeance of the conqueror. Being exasperated by a
                    democratical movement which occurred at Brescia and Bergamo, it had taken
                    advantage of the approach of an Austrian column under Laudon, to excite a
                    general insurrection in rear of the French, and thus endanger the communications
                    of the army whilst engaged in a series of complicated and critical operations. A
                    repetition of the Sicilian Vespers had also taken place at Verona, where every
                    Frenchman found in the streets or houses was butchered in cold blood, and the
                    commandant, General Bal-land, forced to retire into the castles with 3000 men.
                    But when the armistice of Judenburg had recalled Laudon to the Tyrol, the
                    Venetians, being thus abandoned to their own resources, were completely defeated
                    by a corps of 15,000 men under Victor, and the insurgents everywhere dispersed.
                    Napoleon now hastened to regain his communications, by re-entering the Venetian
                    territory, and also to pour the full storm of his wrath on the devoted republic.
                    The senate, in despair, made the most abject offers of submission; but it was
                    too late. The archduke, on whose success they rested all their hopes, had shared
                    the fate of Beaulieu, Wurmser, and Alvinzi; and Napoleon resolved that the Lion
                    of St Mark should lick the dust. Besides, the acts of hostility committed by the
                    senate of Venice were actually to him a piece of good fortune. At Leoben he had
                    promised Austria compensation for the loss of Belgium and Lombardy; but he would
                    have been much puzzled where to find the means of indemnification, if the
                    Venetians had not furnished him with an occasion for disposing of part of their
                    states. The price paid by the republic for its perfidy and cruelty was the
                    surrender of large territories on the mainland, and five ships of war; the
                    payment of three millions of francs in gold, and as much more in naval stores;
                    and giving up twenty of the best pictures, along with five hundred
                    manuscripts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Napoleon
                    has been severely censured for his conduct to Venice, which some have
                    represented as a species of felony; and Botta the historian, after mentioning
                    with admiration the philippics of the priests who preached insurrection and
                    recommended assassination, seems to think it very culpable in the French to have
                    treated these persons as enemies. French blood had been treacherously shed; but
                    for this, it seems, no reparation was due, no punishment exigible. In its last
                    agony, the senate of Venice attempted to propitiate the conqueror, by offering
                    him a purse of L.300,000. He rejected the offer with scorn, telling them that if
                    they could offer him the treasures of Peru, the atonement would be insufficient.
                    Yet he is represented as a monster, because he refused to huckster for the blood
                    of his murdered soldiers; and it is thus that history is sometimes
                    written.</p></note></p>
                <p>After the occupation of Venice, and the dissolution of its oligarchical
                    government, Napoleon established his headquarters at Passeriano, near Udine,
                    where he awaited the arrival of the plenipotentiaries which the emperor was to
                    send to treat of a definitive peace. In order to accelerate théprogress of the
                    negociations, he had, on the 24th of May, signed a preliminary convention with
                    the Duke de Gallo; but the cabinet of Vienna having refused to ratify this act,
                    he repaired to Milan to hasten the organization of the Cisalpine Republic, by
                    annexing to it Modena, Reggio, Brescia, Bergamo, Ferrara, and Bologna, the whole
                    destined to constitute a single state, with about three millions of inhabitants.
                    He also profited by his stay at Milan to direct the democratic revolution, which
                    overturned the oligarchy of Genoa, and placed all the friends of change in
                    entire dependence on France; an event which was soon followed by the
                    establishment of another mushroom state, under the name of the Ligurian
                    Republic. Napoleon regarded Genoa as the most useful dependency which France
                    could then procure to consolidate his work in Italy; and, as political
                    propagandism was the order of the day, he appears to have judged correctly.<note

                <p>In the meanwhile the negociations with Austria made no progress whatever.
                    Scarcely had the preliminaries been signed when misunderstandings arose. The
                    plotters of counter-revolutions had, by means of the elections, succeeded in
                    forming a powerful party in the councils, at the head of which were Pichegru,
                    Villot, and Imbert-Colomès; and a violent struggle was about to take place
                    between the depositaries of the executive power and the legislative body, which
                    last, far from seconding, sought to embarrass the operations of the government.
                    These disorders revived the hopes of Austria. It was believed that some new
                    crisis was approaching in France; the conspiracy of Baboeuf encouraged this
                    notion; the royalists corresponded with the exiled princes and the imperial
                    government; the Directory held its power by an uncertain tenure, amidst so many
                    elements of opposition; and every thing seemed to prognosticate that some
                    important change was at hand. But the events of the 18th of Fructidor (4tb of
                    September 1797) destroyed all these illusions. The Utopian constitution of the
                    year III. was dissolved; Pichegru and other royalists in the assemblies were
                    arrested and sent into exile; Carnot and Barthélemy, who had opposed the
                    majority of the Directory, were likewise banished; and the government for the
                    moment recovered the semblance of security. Astonished at this sudden
                    revolution, and conceiving that it could no longer calculate upon a royalist
                    re-action, the cabinet of Vienna immediately despatched the Count de Cobentzel
                    with full powers to treat; and henceforth the negociations proceeded in a fair
                    train towards a definitive adjustment of differences. The result was the treaty
                    of Campo-Formio, concluded on the 3d of October 1797, and so called from the
                    village at which it was signed. By this act Austria yielded to France Belgium
                    and the boundaries of the Rhine and the Alps, recognised the Cisalpine Republic,
                    and received, as an indemnification for the loss of territory, Venice and her
                    Italian provinces; whilst France assumed the sovereignty of Dalmatia and the
                    Ionian Islands. This peace was glorious, and might have been solid, because,
                    whilst France attained her natural limits, Austria had received ample
                    compensation for the provinces which she ceded in virtue of the treaty. Peace
                    having been thus concluded with Austria, it still remained to negociate with the
                    princes of the empire; and for this purpose a congress of all the German powers
                    was summoned to meet at Rastadt, whither Napoleon repaired as head of the French
                    legation. But perceiving that the discussions would be protracted, he abandoned
                    to his colleagues the conduct of the diplomatic business, and quitted Rastadt,
                    after having provided, by a military convention, for the execution of the treaty
                    of Campo-Formio, in as far as regarded the evacuation by the imperialists of
                    Mayence and the other places on the Rhine.</p>
                <p>Napoleon having thus terminated the most wonderful series of campaigns recorded
                    in the history of war, set out for Paris, where he arrived in the beginning of
                    December. The reception which he met with, on this occasion, was such as would
                    have elated the most modest, and encouraged the least ambitious. It was easy to
                    see that he might aspire to every thing in France. Nevertheless, the time had
                    not yet arrived to profit by his fame, and take advantage of his popularity; it
                    was necessary to wait until the Directory had completed its discredit with the
                    country, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828634" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8634-0725"
                    />lost all hold of public opinion. France had indeed proclaimed him as its hero;
                    but this was not enough, and to become the head of the state, it was necessary
                    to be at the same time its deliverer and restorer. Whatever might be his claims
                    to national gratitude, these could not give him a right to overturn the
                    established government, to which he had been indebted for his rapid advancement
                    and part of his glory ;—it was essential that it should destroy itself by its
                    incapacity, and by the disasters which it brought on France ;—then only could he
                    appear on the scene in the character of the deliverer of his country. And as he
                    knew well with whom he had to do, he did not doubt that sooner or later this
                    would occur; for, independently of the weakness of the individuals composing the
                    Directory, he was convinced that the actual state of affairs could not endure
                    long, and that, in any view, the fall of that body was inevitable. Still the
                    part which he had in the meanwhile to play was sufficiently embarrassing. The
                    pompous but empty title of general-in-chief of the army of England had indeed
                    been conferred upon him; but at this time no preparations had been made for
                    effecting a descent upon England; and all that could have been done would have
                    been to throw twenty or thirty thousand men into Ireland, an enterprise which,
                    however advantageous in itself, was by no means suited to his views. Napoleon,
                    however, was too important a person to remain at Paris with his arms folded, a
                    mere passive spectator of events.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>On his return to Paris, Napoleon took up his residence in
                    the same small and modest house which he had occupied before his departure for
                    Italy, in the Hue Chantereine, where he resumed his favourite studies and
                    pursuits; contented, apparently, with the society of his friends, and carefully
                    avoiding any act which might seem intended or calculated to invite popular
                    notice or distinction. His society was much courted in the highest circles, and
                    he occasionally received company at home; but pride as well as policy led him to
                    shun notoriety, and shrink from being stared at in the streets or saloons as the
                    wonder of the day. On one occasion, when greeted rvith some noisy demonstration
                    of popular favour, “Bah,” said he, “they would crowd as eagerly around me if I
                    were on my way to the guillotine.” At this period he was reserved and
                    thoughtful, like one too much occupied with serious designs to take any pleasure
                    in the elegant frivolities of fashionable conversation. Wherever he appeared he
                    was the man of Lodi, of Arcole, and of Rivoli, disdaining to disguise his
                    military bluntness in those brilliant circles where a man of an inferior stamp
                    of character would have been ambitious to shine. Piqued by this haughty
                    demeanour, Madame de Staël made various attempts to enlist him amongst the
                    number of her votaries, but without success. “Whom,” said she, one day
                    addressing herself to the victorious soldier, “whom do you consider as the
                    greatest of <hi rend="italic">women</hi> ?” insinuating a compliment, in
                    expectation of an equivalent. “Her,” replied Napoleon, dryly, “who has borne the
                    greatest number of children.” This keen retort was not forgotten, and the
                    daughter of Necker became his declared enemy.</p><p>In the camp, as well as in
                    the capita], he had maintained a similar reserve, especially with his officers.
                    It has been said that his character changed with his elevation, and that, in
                    proportion as fortune lavished on him her favours, his coldness and reserve
                    increased. But this is evidently a mean and narrow view of his conduct. No great
                    captain was ever more beloved by his officers, as well as by all who served
                    under him; but to those who were immediately about him, he felt it necessary to
                    observe a certain degree of dignity in his demeanour, in order to insure that
                    ready, unquestioning obedience which is all-important in war. With the common
                    soldiers, however, he often put himself on a footing of perfect familiarity. In
                    the field, he disdained not to share the rations, or to drink from the canteen,
                    of the sentinel; and the French private soldier, often as intelligent as those
                    whom fortune has placed above him, used to accost the general-in-chief with more
                    frankness than he would have ventured to display in addressing his own captain.
                    In his despatches, and particularly in his conversations at St Helena, he often
                    mentioned the pleasure he derived from his intercourse with the men, and at the
                    same time gave many instances of their intelligence and observation. On one
                    occasion, during his Italian campaigns, a common trooper addressed him, as he
                    was riding past, and told the general that he thought he could suggest the
                    movement which ought to be adopted. Napoleon listened to him, and heard him
                    detail some operations which he had himself resolved on but a little before. In
                    this way he won the hearts of the soldiers, and encouraged the display of talent
                    and genius, which, throughout his whole career, he missed no opportunity of
                    rewarding. No one perhaps ever possessed, in the same degree, the secret of
                    calling forth, at his pleasure, all the energies, physical, mental, and moral,
                    of those under his command, and of sustaining the courage and perseverance of
                    his troops on occasions of the severest trial, where, under any other chief,
                    defeat would have been inevitable.</p></note> For although the Directory had
                    mingled its acclamations with those of all France, be knew that Rewbel and
                    Merlin cherished secret enmity towards him, arising, no doubt, out of their
                    fears; that they blamed the resolution which he had taken of concluding the
                    peace of Campo-Formio without waiting for authority from the government; that
                    they accused him of having treated with Austria, instead of marching to Vienna,
                    which, according to these sages, would have revolu-tioned Germany, and afforded
                    them the gratification of constructing some democratical republics out of the
                    ruins of the holy Roman empire. These declamations were no doubt sufficiently
                    absurd and revolting; but it was not the less necessary on that account to adopt
                    some course, especially as the most opposite factions came daily to knock at his
                    gate. An alternative presented itself, which was, either to conspire against the
                    Directory, or to make common cause with it. He chose to do neither; and the only
                    reasonable part which remained for him to take was to withdraw for a time, but
                    to do it in such a manner as to fix attention upon himself, and by his
                    achievements to keep his name in the mouths of the country.</p>
                <p>During the negociations at Campo-Formio, Napoleon had suggested the idea of a
                    descent upon Egypt, though he did not then think of undertaking it himself. The
                    project had been relished by Talleyrand, who, after Fructidor, had replaced
                    Charles Delacroix in the ministry of foreign relations. Napoleon now offered to
                    carry it into execution. The results of such an enterprise might be immense, and
                    this sufficed to render the task worthy of his talents and ambition. On the
                    other hand, the majority of the Directors, to whom his presence gave umbrage,
                    gladly entertained a proposition calculated to rid them of a pacificator whose
                    popularity they dreaded. They were, in fact, enchanted to find him outrunning
                    their wishes by a voluntary exile. Some statesmen, it is true, wished to retain
                    him, representing that, by the force of circumstances, he would be called to
                    take the helm of affairs. But he replied that the pear was not yet ripe, and
                    that he was going to establish new claims to their confidence. Besides, the East
                    presented a field of conquest and glory on which his imagination delighted to
                    dwell. Europe he considered as but a mole-hill in comparison of Asia, whence
                    “all the great glories” had come. And from the view which he took of the state
                    of India at the time, he conceived, that in undertaking to open a direct
                    communication with that country, he was taking the surest means to strike an
                    effective blow at England. The expedition to Egypt had three objects: first, to
                    establish on the Nile a French colony, which, without having recourse to the
                    system of cultivation by slaves, should supply the produce of St Domingo and the
                    sugar islands; secondly, to open new outlets for French manufactures in Africa,
                    Arabia, and Syria, and to obtain, in return, all the productions of these
                    countries; and, thirdly, setting out from Egypt as a base of operations, to
                    carry an army of fifty thousand men to the Indus, and make common cause with the
                    Mahrattas, the Hindus, the Mussulmans, and all the oppressed races of the Indian
                    peninsula.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828647" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8647-0726"/>
                <p>The last was the grand and ultimate object aimed at. An army composed, one half
                    of Europeans, and the other half of natives, transported by ten thousand horses
                    and as many camels, carrying with them provisions for fifty or sixty days, water
                    for five or six, and one hundred and fifty pieces of field artillery, with a
                    double allowance of ammunition, might arrive in four months on the Indus, and in
                    less than as many more decide the fate of India. The desert, he thought, would
                    be no obstacle to any army provided with abundance of camels and dromedaries.
                    Such an enterprise would give a high idea of the power of France; it would fix
                    attention on its leader; it would surprise Europe by its boldness; and, if
                    attended with success, it might be productive of mighty results. Such were the
                    motives which appear to have actuated Napoleon in proposing an expedition which,
                    from very different views indeed, was now determined on by the French
                    government.</p>
                <p>Egypt, it is true, was then a tributary of the Porte, one of the most ancient
                    allies of France; but as the Mamlukes were the real masters of the country, and
                    in open revolt against the Sultan, it was thought that the Divan, already
                    occupied with the war against Paswan Oglou, pasha of Widin, and that against the
                    Wahabees, and obliged, from weakness, to tolerate the independence of a number
                    of refractory pashas, would not, for a mere shadow of sovereignty, throw itself
                    blindly into the ranks of the enemy. The preparations were accordingly carried
                    on with great activity, but with the utmost secrecy. All was under the direction
                    of Napoleon, and his characteristic energy everywhere appeared. To draw the
                    attention of England from the ports of the Mediterranean, he visited those of
                    the Channel, and affected to occupy himself with the project of crossing it,
                    when his thoughts were directed towards the invasion of Egypt. At length, all
                    being ready, he repaired to Toulon on the 10th of May 1798, and, on the 19th,
                    sailed from that port with thirteen ships of the line, six frigates, and a fleet
                    of transports, having on board25,000 men. He was joined at sea by the squadrons
                    which had sailed from Bastia, Genoa, and Civita Vecchia, with from 7000 to 8000
                    men on board, destined to form part of the expedition; and on the 9th of June
                    the whole arrived before Malta. The subsequent history of the expedition, until
                    the return of Napoleon to France, is fully detailed under that head; and in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Egypt</hi> will be found an account of the final
                    conquest of that country by the British under Abercromby and Hutchinson. To
                    these articles the reader is therefore referred for ample information respecting
                    both branches of the subject. It is clear, indeed, that, after the destruction
                    of the French fleet at Aboukir, all the chances of success were changed. It is
                    no doubt true that Napoleon might still hope to maintain himself in possession
                    of the country, provided he succeeded in attaching the inhabitants to his cause.
                    But two serious obstacles presented themselves to the attainment of this object;
                    namely, the maritime blockade, which obstructed all exportation; and the
                    peculiar nature of the Mahommedan religion, which forbids all obedience or
                    submission to an infidel power. Nor were these difficulties lessened by the
                    failure of the attack on St Jean D’Acre, which, in proving that the invaders
                    were not invincible, encouraged resistance and invited hostility.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There are two points
                    connected with this expedition, in regard to which it may be necessary to say a
                    few words. These are, first, the massacre of Jaffa; and, secondly, the poisoning
                    of the plague patients, at the same place, during the retreat from St Jean
                    d’Acre to Egypt-</p><p>First, as to the massacre, it has been urged, that Jaffa
                    having been taken by storm, the garrison might, in the heat of the assault, have
                    been put to the sword. But, on that occasion, about two thousand men, the
                    remains of the garrison, were made prisoners; and the question then arose, how
                    they were to be disposed of. On the one hand, the French army was too weak to
                    admit of detaching sufficient escorts to guard them. On the other, it would have
                    been worse than imprudent to send away on parole men amongst whom the point of
                    honour had no existence; and, besides, a part of the prisoners consisted of
                    Janissaries, who, having been taken at El-Arish, had been liberated on a promise
                    not to serve against the French during the war. In these circumstances Napoleon
                    ordered them to be shot, and the whole perished in consequence. Judged according
                    to the principles of the law of nations, this revolting butchery was wholly
                    unjustifiable. At the same time, some allowance must be made for the
                    circumstances in which he found himself placed. Situated as he was, the safety
                    of his army appeared to him to constitute the supreme law; a supposed necessity
                    alone rendered him cruel. Besides, had the case been reversed, these barbarians
                    would have done the same thing; they would have put their prisoners to death,
                    and gloried in sending their heads to Constantinople. These and other
                    circumstances may in part account for and excuse, but can never justify, the
                    deed; and it cannot be denied that it leaves a deep stain on his
                    memory.</p><p>Next, as to the poisoning of the plague patients, this is a
                    subject in regard to which the most extravagant exaggerations have been
                    disseminated. The facts are few, and may be briefly stated. Having raised the
                    siege of St Jean d’Acre in order to return to Egypt, he caused the hospitals
                    containing the sick and the wounded to be evacuated, every means being put in
                    requisition to transport them across the desert. But fifty, who had been seized
                    with the plague, were not in a condition to be removed; they might have spread
                    the pestilence in the army; and if abandoned to the ferocious Djezzar, they
                    would certainly have been massacred. In these circumstances, Napoleon caused
                    opium to be distributed to them, in order to give them death without suffering.
                    He did wrong, and he confessed it. But that he was actuated by a sentiment of
                    humanity, and did to these men what, in like circumstances, he would have wished
                    done to himself, seems beyond doubt. This is proved by his conduct during the
                    siege, as well as during the retreat. V hen the plague was raging in the army,
                    and the name of this horrible scourge shook the nerves of Europeans; when the
                    sick despaired utterly, and the healthy, filled with indescribable horror,
                    trembled to minister to them in their misery; Napoleon went through the
                    hospitals, breathed hope into the sufferers, rebuked the cowardice of their
                    attendants, and with his own hands relieved the foul ulcers which no one dared
                    to touch. On the retreat to Egypt, his attention to the sick was equally
                    conspicuous. He issued an order that every horse should be given up for their
                    service; and he himself marched on foot, exhibiting to the whole army an heroic
                    example of endurance and compassion. That Napoleon judged wrong in regard to the
                    plague patients, we, however, readily and fully admit He should have left them
                    to the mercy of the Turks, since such was the rigorous fate which their destiny
                    reserved for them.</p></note> The truth of this was soon exemplified by the
                    landing of a Turkish army of 15,000 men in the peninsula of Aboukir, the fort of
                    which they immediately stormed and carried, putting the garrison to the sword.
                    But they paid dear for this momentary success. Napoleon pounced on them like an
                    eagle on its prey, and, by one blow, annihilated a force which, if joined by the
                    Mamlukes (who had re-appeared in Lower Egypt) and by the insurgents of the
                    country, might have proved too formidable to be resisted with any prospect of
                    success. This victory, gained on the 25th of July 1799, gave the more pleasure
                    to Napoleon, that it served to wipe out the stain which the signal defeat
                    sustained by the French fleet under Brueys had attached to the name of
                    Abonkir.</p>
                <p>The destruction of the Turkish army having consolidated the position of the
                    French in Egypt, Napoleon decided on returning to France. Even when before St
                    Jean d’Acre, he ascertained that a new coalition had been formed; and at a later
                    period he received, through Sir Sidney Smith, several English journals, and the
                    French gazette of Francfort, which informed him of the reverses sustained by the
                    armies of Italy and the Rhine, as well as of the successive revolutions which
                    had completed the disorganization and debasement of the Directory. The
                    consummation which he had contemplated before leaving France seemed to have at
                    length arrived; and no obstacle stood in the way to prevent his return to that
                    country. A letter which he had received from the government announced that
                    Admiral Bruix was to sail from Brest, in order to rally under his flag the
                    Spanish squadrons and that of Toulon, and, having <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193828660" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8660-0727"/>thus gained an ascendency in
                    the Mediterranean, to bring back the army of Egypt, if circumstances rendered it
                    necessary to do so. Napoleon was at the same time authorized to return to
                    France. But Bruix had not appeared, nor was there any probability that he would,
                    considering the force and vigilance of the British squadrons. What motive, then,
                    could Napoleon have had to remain in Egypt? On the one hand, he felt himself
                    capable of restoring to his adopted country the lustre of victory, and the
                    benefits of internal and external peace. It was evident that the people were
                    sick of the Revolution, and that the time had arrived for putting an end to it
                    by securing the fruits of that mighty convulsion. On the other hand, all] that
                    remained to be done in Egypt was to colonize a conquered country, for which the
                    principal dispositions had already been made; and Kleber was as capable of
                    completing the enterprise as Napoleon, provided success were still possible. The
                    latter conceived that he could be more serviceable to his country in Europe;
                    and, besides, having resolved to return to France, the moment seemed propitious
                    for carrying his design into effect. This proceeding has been made the subject
                    of vehement declamation and virulent censure, but, as it appears to us, without
                    a shadow of reason. At first Napoleon had received <hi rend="italic">carte
                    blanche</hi> from the Directory; next he had obtained express authority to
                    return; and, in either case, it was perfectly competent for him to do so. But,
                    not to rest altogether upon this, the expedition was either desperate, or it
                    might still sustain itself. In the one case, all that remained to be done was to
                    sign a convention of evacuation, which the humblest officer in the army could do
                    as well as its chief. In the other, Kleber, who succeeded to the command, was
                    capable of contending against all the enemies then existing in those countries,
                    as he fully proved by his subsequent conduct, particularly by the victory he
                    gained at Heliopolis.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    cut short by the dagger of an Arab assassin, hired to revenge the defeat
                    sustained by the Turks at Heliopolis.</p></note> In these circumstances,
                    Napoleon, having left the chief command to this distinguished veteran, sailed
                    from Alexandria on the 24th of August 1799, with a small squadron of four ships,
                    and, after a passage full of marvellous escapes, landed at Fréjus on the 6th of
                    October. His presence excited the enthusiasm of the people, and was considered
                    by them as the certain pledge of victory. His progress to the capital had all
                    the appearance of a triumphal procession, and, upon reaching Paris, he found
                    that every thing was ripe for a great change in France.</p>
                <p>The circumstances attending the revolution of the 18th of Brumaire (9th of
                    November) have been narrated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">France.</hi>
                    That event was not produced, but only accelerated by the return of Napoleon. The
                    necessity of a change in the existing order of things had, for some time, been
                    generally felt and acknowledged. The constitution of the year HL, with its
                    preposterous anomalies, was universally detested, and the authorities which it
                    had produced were deficient in capacity; but it was more easy to indicate the
                    evils which it had produced than to suggest the remedies proper to be applied.
                    At first view, the most simple and regular mode appeared to be, to confide to
                    the legislative body the important task of modifying the constitutional compact.
                    But, in adopting this system, there was reason to apprehend that the councils,
                    eager to encroach on the executive power, would seek every opportunity to
                    abridge it; whilst, on the other hand, if the initiative in these changes were
                    intrusted to the executive authority, the danger became still more imminent
                    that, on one pretence or another, the independence of the legislature would be
                    destroyed, and the councils driven to commit an act of suicide similar to that
                    which had decimated the legislative body on the 18th of Fructidor. Besides, what
                    confidence could be inspired by any reform, the duration of which depended upon
                    the caprice of magistrates whose powers and duties the constitution had so
                    imperfectly fixed and defined? On the arrival of Napoleon, however, the
                    difficulties which had presented themselves in a great measure disappeared, and
                    the idea of reforming a bad system by means of itself was at once abandoned by
                    all parties. The Directorial government having lost all hold on public opinion,
                    and become equally feeble and contemptible, it seemed necessary to replace it by
                    an imposing authority; and there is none so much so as that which is founded
                    upon military glory. Napoleon perceived this in all its force. The Directory
                    could only be replaced by him or by anarchy; and, in such a case, the choice of
                    France could not for a moment be doubtful. Accordingly all parties now ranged
                    themselves under two distinct banners: on the one side were the republicans, who
                    opposed his elevation; and on the other all France, which demanded it. A <hi
                    rend="italic">coup düétat</hi> was nevertheless necessary to produce the
                    revolution of the 18th of Brumaire; and this was effected by the employment of
                    the troops, although without spilling a drop of blood. Napoleon had for a moment
                    hoped that the projected change would be carried by acclamation. He was
                    disappointed. But, after a short and noisy struggle, the republic, born amidst
                    anarchy, and baptized in blood, expired in clamour and uproar, Siéyes assisting
                    in the demolition of his own work; and the Directory was replaced by a
                    provisional consulate, with Napoleon at its head. The dissolution of the
                    councils was followed by the appointment of a legislative commission, and to a
                    committee of this body was assigned the task of preparing a new constitution,
                    which was afterwards denominated that of the year VIII.</p>
                <p>Some of those who assisted in the revolution of Brumaire seem to have supposed
                    that Napoleon, satisfied with the elevation he had attained, would not concern
                    himself about civil affairs, and would leave in their hands a large share of the
                    authority and patronage of the state. Great as had been the ability displayed by
                    him in the field, they little expected that he would evince equal talents and
                    aptitude for government. But these persons, amongst whom were Siéyes and
                    Talleyrand, speedily discovered their mistake. At the very first meeting of the
                    consuls, a lengthened discussion took place concerning the internal condition
                    and foreign relations of France, and the measures not only of war, but of
                    finance and diplomacy, which it either was or might be expedient to adopt. To
                    the astonishment of Siéyes, Napoleon entered fully into all these subjects,
                    showed perfect familiarity with them even in their minutest details, and
                    suggested various resolutions which it was impossible not to approve.
                    “Gentlemen,” said Siéyes, on reaching his house, where Talleyrand and others
                    awaited his arrival, “1 perceive that you have found a master; one who can do
                    and will do every thing himself.” The Abbé was in the right. Napoleon had
                    obtained the first place in the state; and it soon became evident, that whilst
                    he fully understood the nature and duties of his position, he claimed the
                    undivided exercise of the supreme authority. The mass of the nation confided in
                    him, because it knew that the Revolution could have no better guarantee than
                    his; that his elevation held out the prospect of victory abroad, and of a stable
                    government at home, under which life and property would enjoy security; and that
                    whilst he had no <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828673"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8673-0728"/>force except in placing himself at the head of the
                    interests which the Revolution had created, he would employ every means to
                    repress that anarchy under which the nation had so long groaned. Nor were these
                    expectations disappointed. The work of reform proceeded rapidly and surely;
                    order was everywhere established, and vigour infused into all the departments of
                    the state. The situation of France, however, occasioned him some disquietude;
                    and, notwithstanding the chances of success in his favour, he resolved to sue
                    for peace, which he could then do in good faith, because the misfortunes of the
                    preceding campaigns were not his work. But Pitt turned a deaf ear to the
                    application, and never did statesman commit a greater fault; for that was
                    perhaps the only moment at which the allies could with safety have concluded a
                    peace, as France, in suing for it, virtually acknowledged herself vanquished. By
                    this refusal, the English minister obliged Napoleon to enter upon that course of
                    victory and conquest which ultimately extended his empire over the greater part
                    of the Continent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    form of the refusal was somewhat extraordinary. Napoleon had addressed himself
                    directly to the king of Great Britain, but his letter remained unanswered. The
                    secretary of state for foreign affairs, however, transmitted a note to
                    Talleyrand, in which he indicated the return of the Bourbons to France as the
                    only means of putting an end to the troubles of Europe. It was, to say the
                    least, curious to see a government which had twice treated at Lille, and
                    recognised both the Republic and the Directory, refusing to treat with a more
                    solid authority, sanctioned and supported by all France, and deposited in the
                    hands of a man whom victory had illustrated.</p></note></p>
                <p>War being thus inevitable, the First Consul issued a decree, dated the 7th of
                    January 1800, ordaining the formation of an army of reserve, to consist partly
                    of veterans, who were ordered to rejoin their respective corps, but principally
                    of a new levy of 30,000 conscripts. At this time France had three armies on the
                    frontiers, exclusively of the force under General Brune, which watched the
                    partisans of the house of Orange in Holland. The army of Italy, reduced to
                    30,000 men, had taken refuge on the rocks of Genoa; 10,000 more guarded the
                    Cottian Alps and Dauphiné; and the army of the Rhine, which reckoned above
                    100,000 combatants, was cantoned in Alsace and Switzerland, from Strasburg to
                    Schaffhausen. In the presence of the superior forces which the enemy had
                    assembled in the valley of the Po, the French durst not venture to repass the
                    Alps; but it was nevertheless essential either to penetrate at once into Italy
                    and Germany, or to strike such a decisive blow on the Danube, that the peninsula
                    might there be reconquered by dictating peace to Austria in the heart of the
                    hereditary states. In the one case, a double plan of operations would be
                    necessary; in the other, Mantua, Alexandria, and Milan, were to be recovered at
                    Vienna. Napoleon did not long hesitate as to the course to be adopted. He called
                    out the conscripts; caused arms to be forged; appealed to the sentiment of
                    national honour, which is never altogether dormant amongst the French; and
                    assembled an army, young, it is true, but full of enthusiasm. The miserable
                    state of the army of Italy has already been noticed; but that of the Rhine, when
                    united to the army of Italy, presented a fine and formidable body of men, the
                    command of which Napoleon intrusted to Moreau, at the same time sending him the
                    recruits necessary to complete his different corps, and to put him in a
                    condition to assume the offensive. The remainder of his disposable troops was
                    directed on Dijon, where he organized an army of reserve, amounting to 40,000
                    men, which, from that central point, might be ready to march into Suabia,
                    Switzerland, or Italy, according as circumstances should require. The nucleus of
                    this army was formed by two fine divisions, originally drawn from that of
                    General Brune, and which had just completed the subjugation of La Vendée.</p>
                <p>Napoleon’s first thought was to leave the army of Massena in defence on the
                    Apennines, and to carry the army of reserve and that of the Rhine into the
                    valley of the Danube. As the constitution of the year VIII. did not permit the
                    consuls to command the army in person, his intention was to intrust that of the
                    reserve to a lieutenant, and to leave the grand army to Moreau, but at the same
                    time to accompany the head-quarters of the latter, and thence to direct the
                    operations of both. This, however, was warmly opposed by Moreau, who refused to
                    command under Napoleon if the latter should come to his army, and at the same
                    time objected to the plan of operations which the First Consul had
                    proposed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The plan
                    proposed by Napoleon was, in a military point of view, preferable to that
                    adopted by Moreau. He wished the latter to pass the Rhine at Schaffhausen, to
                    take Kray in reverse, and to cut him off from Vienna, by driving him into the
                    angle formed by the Mayn and the Rhine; in a word, to operate against the left
                    of the Austrian general, as he himself did five years afterwards against the
                    right of Mack at Donawerth. Had this plan been adopted, the French would have
                    marched without difficulty on Austria, and would have reconquered Italy in
                    Germany, perhaps at Vienna.</p></note> Being not yet sufficiently strong to
                    break with a man who had numerous partisans in the army, and who, had he
                    possessed energy, might have occupied the first place in the state, Napoleon was
                    obliged to yield; and, accordingly, leaving to his rival the command of the
                    finest army which France had yet seen, with full power to direct it on the
                    Danube in his own way, he then decided to conduct his conscripts by the St
                    Gothard into Lombardy, ordering Lecourbe to second his operations as soon as
                    Moreau should have developed his plan of campaign, and gained the first success.
                    Finding, however, that the attention of Melas was exclusively fixed on Genoa,
                    into which Massena, with the remains of his force, had been obliged to throw
                    himself; and being anxious, if possible, to relieve that place, which was
                    closely invested; he resolved to give the preference to the shorter route of the
                    Great St Bernard, leaving that of the St Gothard to be followed by the corps
                    which were on their march from the Rhine. In the beginning of May Napoleon set
                    out for Dijon, and on the 8th he arrived at Geneva, where he made the necessary
                    dispositions for effecting the passage of the Alps. The operations which
                    followed have been pretty fully detailed in another place. (See the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">France.)</hi> By a series of well-combined manoeuvres and
                    demonstrations, Napoleon deceived Melas as to his movements, descended like a
                    torrent from the Alps upon his line of communications, and, by a single march,
                    conquered Italy. Genoa had indeed surrendered; but the battle of Marengo, fought
                    on the 14th of June, repaired every thing, and, by a victory snatched from the
                    enemy, after he thought the fortune of the day decided, completed at one blow
                    the conquest of Italy. Never as yet had Napoleon been in such imminent peril,
                    noteven at Arcole; never had genius and fortune more happily conspired to change
                    the fate of battle. The victory was glorious, and its results were immense. A
                    convention was entered into, by which Melas obtained permission to retire with
                    his army behind the Mincio; and, in return, he consented to give up Coni,
                    Alexandria, and Genoa, with the fort of Urbino, the citadels of Tortona, Milan,
                    Turin, Pizzighetone, Piacenza, Ceva, and Savona, and the castle of Arona. The
                    armistice of Alexandria was soon afterwards extended to the armies of Germany,
                    and negociations ensued, which, however, in the end proved unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile both parties continued their preparations for a renewal of the contest;
                    and as all hopes of peace had entirely vanished, Napoleon resolved to put an end
                    to the armistice in the middle of November, and, notwithstanding the severity of
                    the season, to recommence hostilities. <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828686"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8686-0729"/>Moreau and Brune accordingly received orders to
                    denounce the armistice, and between the 17th and the 27th all the French troops
                    were put in motion. Leaving the army of the Rhine to the conduct of Moreau,
                    Napoleon had conceived the daring project of attacking the Austrians under
                    Bellegarde on the Mincio, by causing Macdonald, with the army of the Grisons, to
                    clear the whole chain of the Rhaetian Alps, in order to débouché upon Trent, and
                    drive back the Austrians on the lagoons of Venice, at the same time that Brune
                    assailed them in front. And this plan was, to a certain extent, executed.
                    Macdonald effected the passage of the Splugen, at a time when the mere traveller
                    dreads to expose himself amidst its snows, ice, and storms, with every customary
                    precaution; <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>When the project for effecting the passage of the Splugen
                    was communicated to Macdonald, he declared the enterprise impracticable, and
                    sent the head of his staff to state his objections, as well as to explain the
                    inadequacy of his means. Napoleon listened attentively to the statement of this
                    officer, and, after interrogating him on a variety of matters, and at the same
                    time analysing the different hypotheses which the vast theatre of the Alps
                    suggested for his combinations, he replied, “Je ne changerai rien à mes
                    dispositions. Retournez promptement; je vais rompre l’armistice. <hi
                    rend="italic">Dites à Macdonald qu'une armée passe toujours, et en tout saison,

                    the army of the Grisons, defeated the Austrians, and advanced to within a few
                    miles of Venice. But these were, after all, only secondary operations. The fate
                    of the contest was to be decided in Germany, where hostilities recommenced
                    towards the end of November; and, in a few days afterwards, Moreau obtained a
                    decisive victory at Hohenlinden. The battle was obstinate and bloody, but never
                    for an instant doubtful; indeed it is one of the few instances to be met with in
                    war where complete success was obtained by the literal execution of the plan
                    previously devised by the general-in-chief. Moreau lost not a moment in taking
                    measures to improve his success. The Austrians were vigorously pursued, and
                    being driven from Salzburg, and other positions on the Inn, where they had
                    endeavoured to make a stand, were forced to sue for an armistice, which was
                    concluded at Steyer on the 23d of December; the cabinet of Vienna having
                    consented to detach itself from England, and to treat for a separate peace. The
                    operations of the army of Italy were also suspended, in consequence of an
                    armistice which Brune had taken it upon him to conclude at Treviso; and, early
                    in February 1801, a definitive treaty of peace was signed at Lunéville, by which
                    France secured the boundaries of the Rhine and the Alps. This treaty, in fact,
                    differed but little from that which, in 1797, Napoleon had concluded at
                    Campo-Formio.</p>
                <p>But amidst all these successes, the event of the 3d of Nivose (24th of December)
                    convinced Napoleon that he was still upon a volcano. This conspiracy was
                    unforeseen; indeed it was the only one which the police had not baffled
                    beforehand. It took effect, because the conspirators had no confidants. The plan
                    was simple, for it consisted in obstructing the progress of Napoleon’s carriage
                    as it passed along the Rue St Nicaise, and in the same instant exploding a
                    machine crammed with all sorts of combustibles, and hence called <hi
                    rend="italic">the infernal machine.</hi> Napoleon escaped by a miracle; and the
                    interest evinced by the people in his preservation amply indemnified him for the
                    danger to which he had been exposed. The time had not been well chosen by the
                    conspirators, for in France nothing was yet ready for the Bourbons. The
                    assassins were tried, condemned, and executed, glorying in their design, and
                    lamenting that it had not been successful.</p>
                <p>The second coalition being thus dissolved, England alone maintained an attitude
                    of hostility to France; but the progress of events soon developed a prospect of
                    an accommodation. Pitt, sensible that the war had no longer any legitimate
                    object, retired from the ministry; and his successor in office lost no time in
                    renewing with Μ. Otto the negociations which had been broken off towards the
                    close of 1800. The aspect of affairs had, in the interval, been completely
                    changed. On the one hand, victory had again declared in favour of the French
                    arms; Austria had been compelled to conclude a separate peace; Naples had been
                    forced to receive the law of Foligno; an accommodation had taken place between
                    the consular government and the court of Rome; the Emperor of Russia had thrown
                    himself into the arms of France; and the new order of things established in that
                    country had acquired a consistency which justified its formal recognition. On
                    the other hand, England had obtained important advantages. The northern
                    confederacy had been dissolved, or rather destroyed, by the victory of
                    Copenhagen, followed, as it had been, by vigorous demonstrations against Russia;
                    and the ultimate expulsion of the French from Egypt was no longer a matter of
                    doubt. On both sides there existed the strongest motives for accommodation,
                    because neither had apparently any thing more to gain by continuing the contest,
                    and because each could now treat without any great sacrifice of honour or of
                    dignity. Egypt and Malta were at first stumbling blocks in the way of an
                    arrangement; but the conquest of the one led to an adjustment respecting the
                    other; and at length, after a tedious negociation, preliminaries of peace were
                    signed at London on the 1st of October 1801, and these were afterwards followed
                    by a definitive treaty, which was concluded at Amiens on the 27th of March 1802.
                    But the peace of Amiens, like that of Campo-Formio, proved merely an armistice.
                    It was signed in the midst of mutual suspicion; and, before the ink was dry,
                    difficulties arose, and from day to day accumulated the elements of a speedy and
                    inevitable rupture. It is not our business here, however, to enter at all into
                    these matters; and in what remains of this article we must confine ourselves
                    exclusively to what is personal to Napoleon.</p>
                <p>During this short cessation of arms, the attention of the First Consul was
                    occupied with the re-establishment of religion, and the arrangement of a
                    Concordat with the pope. The churches were deserted and in ruins; and, since the
                    famous civil constitution of 1791, the clergy had been in a state of complete
                    schism. His object was to restore the one and to reconcile the other, but
                    without suffering them to acquire the power and influence they had formerly
                    possessed; and, in pursuing it, he was actuated by the same motive which had led
                    Henri IV. two centuries before to espouse the Catholic religion. His next
                    measure was the establishment of a system of National Education, the necessity
                    of which had been much felt ever since the universities and schools under the
                    management of the clergy had been broken up amidst the first violence of the
                    Revolution; and this was followed by the commencement of the great and difficult
                    but highly important task of providing France with an uniform Code of Laws.
                    Innumerable works of public utility were likewise begun. Roads and bridges were
                    planned; museums were founded; and the vain were gratified with rising monuments
                    of magnificence, whilst the reflecting recognised in every such display the
                    depth and forecast of a genius formed for empire. This was more fully evinced in
                    the measures by which Napoleon sought to secure the prolongation of his power.
                    The establishment of the consulate for life, which was decreed on the 2d of
                    August 1802, proved a grand step towards the completion of his design, and
                    formed the primary base of the edifice which it yet remained for him to
                    construct. This dignity <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828699"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8699-0730"/>had already been prorogated for ten years by a
                    senatusconsultum of the 6th of May; but on referring the matter to the people,
                    it was decided that the consulate should be conferred upon him for life. He was
                    now virtually sovereign of France. His task was to terminate the Revolution by
                    giving to it a legal character, that it might be recognised and legitimated by
                    the public law of Europe. But he knew, that before proposing to do so it was
                    necessary to establish its principles, consolidate its legislation, and destroy
                    its excesses. He believed himself strong enough to succeed in this, and he did
                    not deceive himself. The principle of the Revolution was the extinction of
                    Castes, not that of Ranks; it was the equality of Rights, not that of Classes;
                    and by legislating in this spirit, Napoleon maintained all that was worth
                    preserving. With the same view, and in accordance with the same principle, he
                    instituted a new order of chivalry, called the Legion of Honour, which, if it
                    served to further his scheme of empire, did not militate with that equality
                    which alone he sought to maintain.</p>
                <p>This is not the place for entering into any disquisition respecting the causes
                    which so soon led to the rupture of the hollow truce of Amiens. Where a pretence
                    is wanted for coming to blows, it will always be found. Napoleon insisted on the
                    evacuation of Malta, in terms of the treaty, declaring that he would rather see
                    the English encamped on the heights of Montmartre than see them in possession of
                    that island. The British government, on the other hand, professing to discover,
                    on the part of Napoleon, a desire to colonise Egypt, refused to give up Malta;
                    and, after much diplomatic discussion, they presented an ultimatum, in which, as
                    the French ministers had offered to subscribe any arrangement which might
                    satisfy England on the subject of Egypt, they consented not to retain Malta as a
                    possession, but only to reserve the right of occupying it for <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> period of ten years; at the same time stipulating that the French troops
                    should evacuate Holland and Switzerland, and that an indemnity in Italy should
                    be secured for the king of Sardinia. On these conditions they offered to
                    recognise the king of Etruria and the Ligurian Republic. But, firm in his
                    resolution not to deviate from the conditions of the treaty of Amiens, Napoleon
                    rejected all these different articles, and nothing remained but again to have
                    recourse to arms. On the 18th of May 1803, Great Britain declared war against
                    France; and that fierce contest recommenced which, after an unexampled career of
                    victory on the part of Napoleon, was destined to terminate in his downfall. His
                    first measures were, the occupation of Naples and of Hanover; the one undertaken
                    in the view of excluding English commerce from the ports of the south of Italy,
                    and the other for the purpose of holding that hereditary possession until
                    England should discover the necessity of fulfilling the article of the treaty of
                    Amiens respecting the surrender of Malta. His next project was one of a far more
                    daring and formidable character, namely, that of invading England, and thus
                    striking a blow at the heart of his inveterate and implacable enemy. This
                    operation, though difficult, he always regarded as practicable; the various
                    chances he had carefully analysed and investigated; vast combinations were
                    formed with a view to facilitate the descent; and enormous preparations were
                    made for the purpose of carrying it into effect. During the years 1803 and 1804,
                    the French coasts opposite England were covered with camps, in which troops to
                    the amount of 160,000, mostly veterans, were assembled; considerable squadrons
                    were prepared at Brest, Rochefort, and Toulon; and vast flotillas, intended to
                    convey the troops across the Channel, were formed and exercised at various
                    ports, particularly at Boulogne. On the other hand, the spirit of England was
                    effectually roused, and immense preparations were made to repel the threatened
                    invasion. The menaced descent rendered it necessary to organize a system of de
                    fence which entailed enormous burdens on the country, and this to Napoleon was
                    so much gained.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding the vast extent of the means called forth for the defence of
                    the country, the English ministry were not without serious apprehensions as to
                    the result of the threatened invasion; and, to cause a diversion, they are said
                    to have countenanced the unwarrantable warfare of plots and conspiracies. The
                    projects of Pichegru, Georges Cadoudal, and others of the same stamp, are all
                    well known, and have already been described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >France.</hi> That assassination was contemplated by most of them, appears, from
                    the evidence produced, to admit of no doubt whatever; indeed Cadoudal candidly
                    and boldly admitted the fact, at the same time expressing his regret that the
                    project had failed. This must be kept in view in order to judge fairly of what
                    followed. Finding himself exposed to the attempts of desperadoes who aimed at
                    his life, Napoleon resolved to deal a decisive blow, which he considered as
                    indispensable, at once to strike terror into his enemies, and to fix the opinion
                    of those millions of Frenchmen who had adhered to the Revolution, and combated
                    in its defence. A distinguished Bourbon was at the gates of Strasburg; the
                    police pretended to have discovered evidence which implicated him in the designs
                    of those who had plotted against the life of the First Consul; and, under the
                    first excitement produced by this information, the fatal command was issued to
                    seize the prince and bring him to Paris. The order was promptly obeyed, and the
                    Duke d’Enghien, having been seized at Ettenheim, in the territory of Baden, was
                    carried to Paris, where, on his arrival, he was tried by a military commission,
                    as an emigrant who had borne arms against France, condemned, and shot almost
                    immediately after the sentence had been pronounced. This was the most
                    unwarrantable occurrence in the life of Napoleon. Throughout the whole affair he
                    seems to have been hurried on by a species of fatality, which blinded him to the
                    true character of the proceeding, and prevented him from reflecting on the
                    consequences of which it was certain to be productive. That he was misled by the
                    infamous reports of the secret police, and by the perfidious suggestions of
                    those around him, may perhaps be true; indeed there is good reason to believe
                    that such was the case. He was likewise kept in ignorance of the afflicting
                    circumstances which accompanied the catastrophe; and the appeal made to his
                    clemency by the unfortunate prince was infamously withheld until after the
                    sacrifice of the ill-fated victim had been consummated; but, with every
                    allowance which can justly be made, it must nevertheless be admitted that, in
                    commanding the seizure of the duke in a neutral territory, he became answerable
                    for all the consequences which ensued, and that he had the double misfortune to
                    incur the guilt of a public crime, and at the same time to commit a political
                    error of the greatest magnitude.</p>
                <p>The conspiracies intended to subvert the power of Napoleon, however, served only
                    to confirm it; and the necessity of restoring to France an hereditary and stable
                    government had now become equally obvious and urgent. An elective authority
                    gives occasion to continual convulsions; it is contemptible even where it is
                    connected with a legitimate dynasty, as in Poland and in the Germanic empire;
                    and in a country situated like France it would have been the height of
                    absurdity. A motion was accordingly made and carried in the Tribunate, that the
                    imperial dignity should be conferred upon Napoleon; the legislative body without
                    hesitation adopted the proposition; and a senatus-consultum appeared, in which
                    he was declared Emperor of the French, with remainder to his male line, or, in
                    the event of his having no children, to any son or grandson of his brothers whom
                    he might chuse to adopt as his heir. This decree was sent down to the
                    departments, and, on the 1st of December 1804, the prefects reported that <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193828712" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8712-0731"/> between three and
                    four millions of citizens had subscribed their assent to the proposed measure; a
                    result which certainly indicated the approbation of the French people. By the
                    army the elevation of Napoleon was hailed with enthusiasm; and when he visited
                    the camp at Boulogne, he was received with an excess of military devotion. His
                    coronation took place at Paris on the 2d of December, amidst all that was most
                    splendid and illustrious in that capital. The ceremony was performed in the
                    cathedral of Nôtre-Dame, where the pope officiated on the occasion, and
                    consecrated the diadems, which Napoleon placed on his own head and on that of
                    the Empress Josephine. In like manner, on the 25th of May 1805, he placed on his
                    head the iron crown of the Lombard kings, in their ancient capital, and
                    henceforth styled himself Emperor of the French and King of Italy; announcing,
                    however, that the two crowns should not be held by the same person after his
                    death. Never was any revolution so easily effected as that which overturned the
                    French republic, in defence of which so much blood had been shed. And the reason
                    is plain; the substance of all that had been fought for was maintained; the name
                    only was changed.</p>
                <p>The history of the wars of the empire belongs to that of France, Spain, Austria,
                    Prussia, and Russia, to which the reader is accordingly referred. To give
                    details of these various contests would fill many volumes, and even the most
                    meagre abridgment would occupy a space far exceeding the limits prescribed to
                    this article. The Emperor Napoleon again made an offer of peace, which was
                    rejected, and a new coalition, being the third, was formed against France. The
                    ostensible objects of this league were to restore the independence of Holland
                    and Switzerland, to free the north of Germany from the presence of the French
                    troops, to deliver Piedmont, and to compel the evacuation of Italy; but its
                    grand aim and design, in as far as concerned England, was to find employment for
                    the French troops on the Continent, and to avert, for a time at least, the
                    dangers of a threatened invasion. The hopes of the allies were, however,
                    speedily crushed by the decisive victories of Ulm and Austerlitz; and Napoleon
                    would soon have been at liberty to turn his arms against England, had it not
                    been for two events, one of which served in a great measure to counterbalance
                    his successes in Germany. We allude to the battle of Trafalgar, in which, on the
                    21st of October 1805, the very day after Mack surrendered at Ulm, the French
                    grand fleet was annihilated by one mighty blow, and the means of effecting a
                    descent on England completely destroyed. The other event above referred to was
                    the declaration of war by Prussia, after Austria had been crippled and forced to
                    receive the law from the conqueror, and whilst the Russian army was still behind
                    the Vistula. This rash and headlong conduct was dearly expiated at Iena and
                    Auerstadt, and the dismemberment of the Prussian monarchy formed a just
                    retribution for the double perfidy and presumptuous confidence of the cabinet of
                    Berlin. The campaign of 1807, after a prodigious effusion of blood, terminated
                    with the battle of Friedland; and the peace of Tilsit, which followed, not only
                    confirmed the humiliation of Prussia, but appeared to throw Russia into the arms
                    of France. The French emperor had already made a gigantic stride towards the
                    establishment of an European monarchy, and the effectual exclusion of English
                    commerce from the ports of the Continent, by which means he vainly hoped
                    eventually to reduce Great Britain to the necessity of listening to terms of
                    accommodation.</p>
                <p>In prosecution of this system, which ultimately proved the main instrument of his
                    ruin, when, to all human appearance, it seemed about to be crowned with success,
                    Napoleon commenced his aggressions on Portugal and Spain, and thus entangled
                    himself in a struggle which, like a festering ulcer, continued to gnaw at the
                    vitals of his power, and became the proximate cause of his ultimate overthrow.
                    In vain did he bring all his means to bear upon this unhappy contest; in vain
                    did he drive the English under Sir John Moore out of Spain. If permitted to
                    finish his task, the subjugation of the Peninsula could not have been long
                    deferred; but the formation of a fourth coalition again called him away into
                    Germany, where Austria, scarcely dissembling her aversion to the continental
                    system, was actively preparing to take up arms, in the hope of recovering what
                    she had lost, and freeing herself from the yoke of France. The attempt, however,
                    proved unsuccessful; and though accident gave her a temporary advantage at
                    Aspern, the battle of Wagram placed her once more at the feet of the conqueror.
                    At this moment the power of Napoleon seemed irresistible. No enemy opposed him
                    on the Continent except the insurgents in Spain, aided by the English; and had
                    he instantly directed his whole energies to terminate the war in the Peninsula,
                    it is probable that his power would have remained unshaken by any reverse likely
                    to befall him. But he judged otherwise; and, in seeking to attach Austria to his
                    interests by a marriage with a princess of the imperial family, he became
                    involved in a system of policy, the ultimate term of which was the abdication of
                    1814. From this moment his ascending movement was stopped; he had reached the
                    culminating point of his greatness; and though his genius had as yet lost
                    nothing of its vigour, his power began to decline.</p>
                <p>The events of 1810 and 1811 belong chiefly to the history of Spain, where the
                    impassible system of Wellington was gradually but steadily breaking down all
                    opposition, and maturing a resistance which every day became more formidable.
                    Those of 1812 were fraught with the destiny of Napoleon. He had long regarded a
                    war with Russia as inevitable. The co-existence of two such empires as those of
                    France and Russia seemed to him incompatible; and differences speedily arose
                    which prognosticated a terrible collision. The preparations on both sides were
                    immense; the fate of Europe, or rather of the empire of the world, was about to
                    be decided in a single campaign; but Napoleon contemplated the conflict without
                    dread, because, in his view, it afforded the only means of terminating for ever
                    the long struggle which had consumed his life. Russia was too strong ever to
                    enter voluntarily into the European system, such as Napoleon wished to
                    reconstruct it, with France as its pivot; but the development of that system he
                    considered as indispensable to his own safety, not to mention the stability of
                    his power; and hence war seemed to him to be inevitable. Russia, on the other
                    hand, resolved sternly to abide the terrible onset, and to trust to her cause,
                    her climate, and her arms. The result is known to all. Amidst the frozen steppes
                    of the Scythian wilderness perished those invincible legions which had carried
                    the imperial eagles in triumph to Vienna, to Berlin, to Warsaw, and to Moscow.
                    No such catastrophe had ever been witnessed in modern times; all preceding
                    examples of suffering and disaster in war sank into nothing in comparison with
                    it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The causes which led
                    to the disastrous termination of Napoleon’s Russian campaign appear to have been
                    various. 1. The necessity of advancing beyond Smolensko in the first campaign, a
                    necessity imposed by circumstances which only left to Napoleon the choice of
                    proceeding further or retracing his steps. 2. The circumstance of no decisive
                    battle having taken place between Wilna and the Dwina, within which limits a
                    repetition of Austerlitz or of Friedland would have placed Europe at 1ιis feet.
                    3. The imbecile conduct of Jerome, in not destroying Bagration after he had been
                    cut off by the movements of Napoleon. 4. The indifference of the Poles of <pb
                    corresp="kp-eb0715-8725-0732" xml:id="pbn7732"/> Volhynia and Podolia, who did
                    not second Napoleon’s projects with the ardour he expected, though it was
                    undoubtedly their interest to aid him by every means in their power. 5. The
                    total want of resources in Lithuania, occasioned partly by the deficient harvest
                    of the preceding year, and partly by the contributions levied to fill the
                    Russian magazines. 6. The distance of the French magazines established at
                    Königsberg, which were twenty-five marches in the rear, so that it required
                    fifty days for a convoy to go and return, a circumstance which prevented the
                    possibility of regular distributions. 7∙ The inexplicable delay at Wilna, where
                    Napoleon remained fifteen days inactive, instead of pushing at once on Glubokoë
                    and Polotsk, or falling upon Bagration at Minsk, either of which would have led
                    to important results, though the false direction given to the principal Russian
                    army on Drissa pointed it out as the main object of attack. 8. The inefficient
                    conduct of Murat, in command of the van-guard, who, with thirty thousand horse,
                    failed to make any serious impression on the enemy during their retreat. 9. The
                    tactical error committed at Borodino, in crowding the troops into masses; a
                    circumstance which prevented the extreme left of the Russians from being
                    assailed with sufficient vigour by the old Smo- 1ensko road, where success
                    would, in all probability, have been decisive. 10. The discontinuing the pursuit
                    of the Russian army on its departure from Moscow, when it was much weakened in
                    numbers, and greatly shattered by the dreadful conflict in which it had recently
                    been engaged. 11. Want of knowledge of the country, the existing maps of which
                    were detestable, and often served to mislead, whilst no accurate information
                    could be obtained from the inhabitants. 12. The peace with Turkey, and the
                    alliance of Bernadotte with the Russians, which altered all the chances, by
                    giving two armies more to the enemy. 13. The progress made by the Russians in
                    the art of war, which was particularly evinced in the conduct of the retreat
                    from Drissa, and subsequently in the movement which united the different masses
                    of the Russian troops on the Berezina, one of the most remarkable military
                    operations of the age. 14. The capital fault committed by Napoleon, in not
                    uniting under one vigorous and able chief the corps of Macdonald, Oudinot, St
                    Cyr, and Victor, and in leaving, disseminated on the Dwina, 100,000 men, who, if
                    united, would have destroyed Wittgenstein, and rendered his position secure. 15.
                    And, lastly, the great efforts made by the Russian nation, and the resolute
                    character displayed by the Emperor Alexander. Such appear to us to have been the
                    principal causes which led to the disastrous termination of Napoleon’s Russian
                    campaign. The whole calamity has usually been attributed to the cold; but this
                    was so far from being the primary cause of failure, that it continued to be very
                    supportable till the arrival of the French on the Berezina, where, out of
                    300,000 men whom Napoleon had either moved on the Dwina or carried to Moscow,
                    not more than 50,000 remained in a condition to fight.</p></note> Yet Napoleon,
                    undismayed by the magnitude of. the calamity, displayed the almost miraculous
                    resources of his genius in repairing the losses he had sustained; and his
                    appearance in Germany<pb corresp="pbn7732" facs="nls:193828725"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8725-0732"/> early in 1813, at the head of a powerful army, is
                    perhaps the most astonishing circumstance in his extraordinary career. But
                    fortune had now completely changed sides. Victorious at Lutzen, at Bautzen, and
                    at Dresden, he was, through the treachery of his allies, and the faults of his
                    lieutenants, defeated at Leipzig, and forced to retreat beyond the Rhine. Still
                    he maintained the struggle with incomparable energy and perseverance; and never
                    did his transcendent genius for war display itself more resplendency than in the
                    astonishing campaign of 1814, when, by incredible efforts, he struggled, though
                    in vain, to expel the invaders from the territory of France. But the battle of
                    Montmartre, followed by the capitulation of Paris, decided the fate of the
                    campaign, and with it that of Napoleon. He might indeed have retired behind the
                    Loire, and there rallied under his banners Soult, Suchet, and Augereau, with a
                    mass of from 120,000 to 130,000 men; but the marshals were tired of war, the
                    spirit of the nation had sunk under its misfortunes, the people demanded that a
                    term should be put to their sufferings, and Napoleon himself shrunk from
                    entailing upon France the still greater calamities of a civil war. In these
                    circumstances, he resolved to abdicate, and, on the 18th of April, signed an
                    instrument by which he renounced for himself and his heirs the thrones both of
                    France and of Italy.</p>
                <p>The allies having left Napoleon the choice of his retreat, he chose the island of
                    Elba, near to Corsica, where he was born, and close to Italy, the first theatre
                    of his glory; and set out, accompanied by four commissioners, one from each of
                    the great allied powers. He was allowed to retain the title of Emperor, and to
                    take along with him a small number of those veteran soldiers who had accompanied
                    him in so many dangers, and whose attachment was not shaken by his misfortunes.
                    In traversing France on his way to the place of his exile, he had occasion to
                    observe the extreme divergence of opinion respecting himself; for in proportion
                    as he was beloved and regretted in the environs of Paris and the provinces of
                    the east, he was detested in those of the south, where even the respect due to
                    misfortune was denied him; and he was more than once obliged to put himself
                    under the protection of the stranger, to defend his life against the people who
                    had been so often intoxicated with his triumphs. On the 4th of May he landed in
                    Elba, wherein, being separated from his wife and son, and without any projects
                    for the future, he seemed to regard himself as politically dead to Europe, with
                    no other task remaining for him to perform but that of writing the history of
                    the rise and fall of his power.</p>
                <p>But the march of events advanced so rapidly, that he was surprised by them even
                    in his retreat. He perceived that Louis XVÎIĬ. had not discovered the secret of
                    his age; he was convinced that the majority of France desired to secure the
                    results of the Revolution; and he knew that this majority would ultimately
                    dictate the law. Louis XVIII. had no doubt granted a charter, which was
                    excellent in itself, as all charters are when taken by themselves; but such acts
                    are valuable only with reference to the authority charged with defending them;
                    and in France the king was not so much the head of the state, as the head of a
                    party which regarded the charter with aversion, as a concession to the
                    revolutionary principle, and hoped to destroy it piecemeal, according as
                    opportunities offered for doing so. Napoleon anxiously watched the progress of
                    events, which outrun his expectations; he was also well informed as to what
                    passed at the congress of Vienna; and having learned in time that the ministers
                    of Louis XVIII. had proposed to the congress to remove him from Elba, in order
                    to send him in exile to St Helena, he conceived a project which will appear
                    audacious in history, but which, in reality, circumstances indicated as the only
                    reasonable course to be followed. He resolved to return to France.</p>
                <p>His preparations were not long; he brought nothing with him but arms, and trusted
                    that France would provide the rest. After a passage of five days, he landed
                    without opposition at Cannes, near the spot where, fifteen years before, he had
                    disembarked on his return from Egypt. This memorable event took place on the 1st
                    of March 1815. He had no determinate plan, because he wanted particular data as
                    to the state of affairs; his intention was to be guided by events, making
                    provision only for probable contingencies. Nor was he at all embarrassed as to
                    the route he should take; for he required a point of support, and as Grenoble
                    was the nearest fortress, he lost no time in directing his march on that place,
                    which opened its gates to receive him. The enthusiasm of the troops knew no
                    bounds, and the reception which he everywhere met with confirmed him in his
                    project. In fact, his march to Paris was throughout a triumphal procession. In
                    twenty days this new revolution was terminated without having cost a single drop
                    of blood. Amidst the acclamations of all France, Napoleon was reinstated on the
                    throne. The grandeur of his enterprise had effaced the recollection of his
                    misfortunes; it had restored to him the confidence of the French people; and he
                    was once more the man of their choice.</p>
                <p>Napoleon had refused the peace which was offered him at Châtillon, because he was
                    then on the, throne of France, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828738"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8738-0733"/>and the terms proposed would have made him descend
                    too much; but he could accept that which had been granted to the Bourbons,
                    because he had just returned from Elba, and because one at the head of a great
                    movement may stop short when ascending, but never when descending. Peace,
                    however, was denied on any terms. It was declared by the Congress of Vienna, in^
                    a proclamation published by them to all Europe, that Napoleon, “by appearing
                    again in France, had deprived himself of the protection of the law, and
                    manifested to the world that there could neither be peace nor truce with him.”
                    Nothing remained, therefore, but to commit the future destiny of Europe to the
                    arbitrement of arms. The most active preparations were accordingly' made on both
                    sides; by Napoleon, to repel the threatened aggression; and by the allies, to
                    overturn the government which had been so suddenly reconstituted in France.
                    Various attempts were made to open a negociation with the allies, but all proved
                    abortive; and as Napoleon had no intention to await the onset of his enemies, he
                    resolved to fall upon the Anglo-Prussians, before the troops of Austria or
                    Russia could be in a condition to take part in the conflict. By the end of May
                    he had about 180,000 ready to take the field, and by the middle of July this
                    number would have been increased to 300,000; but by transporting the seat of war
                    into Belgium, he would save France from invasion, draw on the enemy six weeks
                    sooner than he would have come of his own accord, and perhaps also take him
                    unprepared. These considerations decided him to become the assailant. On the
                    12th of June he set out from Paris, and on the 14th he established his
                    head-quarters at Beaumont, where, in order to profit by the dissemination of the
                    enemy, he judged it necessary to open the campaign without a moment’s delay.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, he passed the frontier of Belgium on the 15tb, and on the following
                    day advanced to Fleurus, where he discovered the Prussian army ranged in order
                    of battle between St Amand and Sombref. Ney had received orders to push forward
                    with 42,000 men by the Brussels road as far as Quatre Bras, an important point
                    situated at the intersection of the roads leading to Brussels, Neville,
                    Charleroi, and Namur, and there to keep the English in check, and prevent them
                    from advancing to the aid of the Prussians, whom Napoleon proposed to attack
                    with the 72,000 men that remained under his command. The battle of Ligny
                    followed, in which the Prussians were defeated; and so complete was the rout,
                    that, of 70,000 men, their generals were never afterwards able to assemble more
                    than about 30,000. A night pursuit would have annihilated them. But Ney had been
                    much less fortunate at Quatre Bras, where he displayed great infirmity, neither
                    bringing his whole force to bear on the English, nor throwing himself back on
                    Bry to act on the rear of the Prussians. The Prussian army being thus defeated,
                    Grouchy was detached in pursuit of it with 35,000 men, whilst Napoleon proceeded
                    to turn his efforts against Wellington. We have no space to detail the
                    operations which followed, nor even to describe that fierce conflict which
                    decided the fate of Napoleon, and with it that of Europe. The result, more fatal
                    to France than that of either Agincourt or Poictiers, is known to every one. By
                    the timely arrival of the Prussians, who had given the slip to Grouchy, and
                    their junction with the English, the French army was not only defeated, but
                    totally dispersed. In the conduct of the battle Napoleon certainly committed
                    faults, particularly in forming his troops into too deep masses, and also in
                    employing his cavalry too early in the action; but these sink into nothing
                    compared with the gross blunders of his lieutenants, by which both the French
                    army and himself were utterly undone.</p>
                <p>He returned to Paris, in the hope that the national spirit might be roused, and
                    that all good Frenchmen would unite in defending their country against another
                    foreign invasion. But he soon found that he had deceived himself. Misfortune had
                    deprived him of all consideration; he experienced opposition where he least
                    expected it; the chambers rose in a state of insurrection against him; and, in a
                    short time, he was compelled to sign a second abdication. He then decided to
                    retire to America, and at first proposed to embark at Bordeaux, where his
                    brother Joseph had hired a merchant-vessel for the purpose. But he afterwards
                    changed his purpose, and set out for Rochefort, where he arrived on the 3d of
                    July. Finding it impossible, however, to put to sea, and nearly equally perilous
                    to return to the interior, he took the resolution of throwing himself upon the
                    generosity of the prince regent of England; and, on the 15th, embarked on board
                    of the Bellerophon, in Aix roads. It is universally known in what manner this
                    appeal was answered. By a formal decision of the English government, he was sent
                    <hi rend="italic">as a prisoner of war</hi> to St Helena, where he pined away in
                    hopeless exile, until death put an end to his misery on the 3d of May 1821. In
                    his will he had expressed a desire that his body should be conveyed to France
                    and buried on the banks of the Seine, “amongst the French people, whom he had
                    loved so well ;” but this request could not, it seems, be complied with; and he
                    was interred in a spot near Longwood, the place of his residence in the island,
                    where a huge block of stone uncarved with a name covers the remains of him who
                    needs no epitaph.</p>
                <p>Posterity will judge of the treatment which Napoleon experienced at the hands of
                    England. A prisoner in another hemisphere, he laboured to defend the reputation
                    which he knew history was preparing for him, and which various parties
                    exaggerated or blackened, according to the dictates of their respective
                    prejudices or passions. But death surprised him at the moment when he was
                    putting his commentaries into shape, and he consequently left them imperfect.
                    They contain much, however, that is not only valuable in itself, but calculated
                    to dispel prejudice, and to throw light upon some of the most important events
                    in his life; and no one can read them attentively without experiencing a feeling
                    of respect and sympathy, mixed with admiration. No man, perhaps, was ever made
                    the object of such unsparing abuse, such bitter detraction, such inveterate and
                    unrelenting rancour; but it is already certain, that neither envy, nor malice,
                    nor hatred, nor slander, vzill ultimately succeed in depriving him of his just
                    fame. By his victories of Montenotte, Castiglione, Rivoli, the Pyramids,
                    Marengo, Ulm, Austerlitz, Iena, Friedland, Abensberg, Ratisbon, Wagram, Dresden,
                    Champaubert, Montmirail, and Ligny, he acquired enough of glory to efface the
                    single disaster of Waterloo; and his five codes embody a system of
                    jurisprudence, in the formation of which he had a principal share, and which has
                    not only proved a boon of inestimable value to France, but is even at this day
                    received as authoritative in a great portion of Europe; thus justifying his own
                    proud anticipation, that he would go down to posterity with the codes in his
                    hand. The monuments which he has left in France and in Italy will also attest
                    his grandeur to the most remote ages; and though he can never be freed from the
                    reproach of ambition, yet, in extenuation of this “glorious fault,” he might
                    say, like Mahommed,</p>
