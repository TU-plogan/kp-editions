                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">NAIRNSHIRE</label>, a small county in Scotland. It is
                    situated between 57° 22' and 57° 40' north latitude, and 3° 47' west longitude,
                    having the Moray Frith on the north, Morayshire on the east and south, and the
                    county of Inverness on the west. Its extent from north to south is from twelve
                    to twenty miles, and from east to west from ten to thirteen; and its contents
                    are 198 square miles, or 126,720 English acres, of which only about a fourth
                    part is in cultivation, the rest consisting principally of waste and moor
                    ground, with about 8000 acres of wood, chiefly planted, about two square miles
                    of lakes, and a small proportion of moss. It has only four entire parishes,
                    Nairn, Auldearn, Cawdor, and Ardclach, and portions of other five, which belong
                    to the counties of Moray, Ross, and Inverness. Two detached districts,
                    Ferintoshand Dunmaglass, belong to Nairnshire; the former lying near Dingwall in
                    Ross-shire, and the latter at the head of Strathnairn in Inverness-shire.</p>
                <p>The sea shore of Nairnshire is low, bare, and sandy; and the approaches to it
                    from the Moray Frith are all beset by numerous sand-banks, especially from Fort
                    George to Whiteness Point, where the free channel is narrow, and the navigation
                    intricate and dangerous. To the eastward the sand has been drifted into hillocks
                    and even hills of sand, the parents, it is believed, of the great sand floods
                    which have buried the estate of Culbin, below Forres. Near to the coast there
                    rises to the height of about ninety feet a bluff terrace-bank, from the top of
                    which the country deflects back in several gentle undulations to the slopes of
                    the first chain of hills on the south side of the river Nairn, the undulating
                    plain being from one to four or five miles broad. The terrace-bank is part of a
                    general one which encircles the Moray Frith, and which, with the waving
                    cultivated grounds behind, consists of a great deposit of sand and gravel, the
                    rolled <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> in part of the ancient mountains, and also,
                    most likely, of the solid rocks which at one time filled up the basin of the
                    frith. Owing to this preponderance of sand in the subsoil, the alluvial covering
                    of Nairnshire is in general extremely slight, sandy, and porous; and as the
                    gravel beds are deep, rocks <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> are but seldom seen
                    (with the exception, however, of some about the principal town, and Boath, which
                    form good building stones) till we reach the south-western bank of the river
                    Nairn. There the nearest chains of hills, which, rising gradually from the east
                    to an altitude, on the confines of Inverness-shire towards the west, of perhaps
                    1500 feet, are skirted by a narrow strip of the old red sandstone formation,
                    with its associated coarse conglomerate, dip beneath the gravel beds.
                    Immediately behind, the whole country, extending from the river Nairn to the
                    Findhorn, and in one part beyond it to Duthel in Strathspey, consists of
                    primitive rocks, the only stratified member of which is gray gneiss, with a few
                    occasional beds of bluish granular limestone. All the rest are varieties of
                    granite, the most abundant variety being a red or flesh-coloured and
                    largegrained granite, which about Park is beautifully porphyritic, with large
                    crystals of felspar. All the rocks, as well those of the sandstone deposits on
                    the north, as of the primary masses in the interior, exhibit undoubted and very
                    extensive indications, in their shattered and uplifted positions, of several
                    great granitic eruptions having occurred at different times.</p>
                <p>On the Findhorn the scenery is in general wild and grand; the hills above are
                    moorish, lumpish, and unbroken in their outlines; the banks of the Nairn,
                    excepting the short distance they are enlivened by the contiguous pleasure
                    grounds attached to the several seats of Kilravock Holm and Contray, are tame
                    and uninteresting; but along the course of the streams traversing the sandstone
                    rocks, we meet scenes of simple picturesque beauty. Such especially is the burn
                    of Cawdor, which, for about two miles above the Castle of Cawdor, has cut down
                    the conglomerate rocks into most beautiful pyramidal curves, the deep dell
                    stretching around them being clothed with the most luxuriant vegetation, from
                    either side of which a fine old oak forest, and more recent plantations of pines
                    and oaks, cover for miles the lower slopes of the hills constituting the
                    beautiful grounds of Lord Cawdor.</p>
                <p>Nairnshire cannot boast of a peculiar Flora; but some rare plants occur, as
                    potamogeton praelongus in Lochlee, and along with nymphaea alba in Loch Littie;
                    <hi rend="italic">gagea</hi> lutea and ranunculus aurieous near Blackhills;
                    carex vesicaria and lycopus europaeus near Millhill; salicornia herbacea,
                    teesdalia nudicaulis, and carex incurva, about Nairn; milium effusum, festuca
                    calamaria, convallaria majalis, lycopus europaeus, listera ovata, goodyera
                    repens, sco-lopendrium vulgare, lycopodium inundatum, about Cawdor.</p>
                <p>The territory of Nairnshire, exclusive of the lands belonging to and held of the
                    burgh of Nairn, is divided into fifteen estates, of which nine are under the
                    valuation of L.500 Scots, other three under L.2000, and the remaining three
                    above L.2000. The valued rent is L. 15,062.15s. Id. Scots, of which about one
                    fourth is entailed. The real rent is now (1837) supposed to be fully L.16,000.
                    The principal residences are, Cawdor Castle, the Earl of Cawdor; Kilravock
                    Castle, Rose; Lethen House and Coulmony, Brodie; Kinsteary, Gordon; Boath,
                    Dunbar; and Geddes, Mackintosh.</p>
                <p>This county is further subdivided into farms, in general small and unenclosed.
                    Although it is far behind the neighbouring counties of Moray and Ross in its
                    agriculture, yet the gradual introduction of the use of lime along with the
                    turnip husbandry is fast ameliorating the appearance of the cultivated districts
                    of the county. Its live stock presents nothing worthy of particular notice; the
                    cattle are generally small and puny, a sort of mongrel breed intermediate
                    between the Highland and the Morayshire, but inferior to both.</p>
                <p>This county sends a member to parliament alontr with Elginshire; and the town of
                    Nairn joins with Inverness, Forres, and Fortrose, in the election of a member
                    for these burghs. The number of county electors is 116, and those of the burgh
                    amount to seventy-one. The counties of Elgin and Nairn are under the
                    jurisdiction of the same sheriff, who has a substitute for the latter county in
                    the town of Nairn.</p>
                <p>Nairnshire formed a part of the ancient province of Moray. A few miles to the
                    east of Nairn, at a place called Harmuir, Macbeth, according to Shakspeare, met
                    the witches on his way to Forres. Near to the village of Auldearn, Montrose
                    obtained a great victory over the Covenanters in 1645. The county contains the
                    ruins of several castles, and other remains of an early age. The castles of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193828153" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8153-0688"/> Cawdor and
                    Kilravock, both of great antiquity, are still the seats of their
                    proprietors.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Nairn,</hi> the county town, and a royal burgh, is a place
                    of considerable antiquity, pleasantly situated on the northern bank of the
                    Nairn, near its mouth. It has no manufactures, and but little trade, and
                    contains about 2000 inhabitants. The National Bank and the British Linen Company
                    have opened branches here, and an academy has lately been erected by
                    subscription. Nairn has an excellent inn, with hot and cold salt-water baths;
                    and from the dryness and salubrity of the climate, it is much resorted to in
                    summer for sea-bathing.</p>
