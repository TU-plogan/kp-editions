                <p><label type="entry">NASSAU</label>, a sovereign dukedom in Germany, the reigning
                    family of which is distinguished by its antiquity, and the number of eminent men
                    it produced at the most interesting period of European history. The founder of
                    the sovereignty of this family was Waltram of Laurenburg, the ruins of whose
                    castle stand on the banks of the Lahn. His sons divided the inheritance among
                    them; but some branches becoming extinct, the whole were united again in the
                    year 1523, under Count Adolph, and continued so till 1605, when, under Louis II.
                    the territories were distributed among three of his sons, who thus became
                    sovereigns with the title of Graffs or Counts. They were, first, Saarbruck,
                    divided in the next generation into two branches, called Saarbruck-Sarbruck and
                    Sarbruck-Usingen, both of which were again united in 1735; but the branch became
                    extinct in 1797, and the land devolved on the present line: Secondly, Idstein, a
                    branch which became extinct in 1721: Thirdly, Weilburg, on which all the states
                    devolved, and since 1816 have formed but one principality. During the French
                    revolution, the city of Saarbruck, with its territory upon the left bank of the
                    Rhine, was seized by the republicans. It then comprehended 430 square miles of
                    land, with 53,000 inhabitants; for which, at the pacification in 1803, it
                    received an indemnification of 750 square miles and 93,000 inhabitants, which
                    were added to the Grafschaft of Usingen. The Count of Weilburg had lost, on the
                    left bank of the Rhine, 170 square miles and 19,000 inhabitants, for which he
                    received on the other side of that stream a territory of 330 square miles, with
                    37,000 inhabitants. At the period when Napoleon instituted the confederation of
                    the Rhine in 1806, the whole of these families had been united in the person of
                    the existing prince, who then received, in addition to the former territories
                    which he possessed, a tract of land of 650 square miles, with 84,500
                    inhabitants, and at the same time the title of duke was conferred upon the
                    reigning prince.</p>
                <p>At the peace which followed the capture of Paris, the territory assigned to the
                    dukedom, as well as the title, were affirmed by the great powers; and by them it
                    was stipulated, that in case of the extinction of that branch of the family of
                    Nassau which filled the throne of the Netherlands, the present ducal family of
                    Nassau should succeed to the inheritance of the duchy of Luxembourg. The
                    stipulations on this subject seem to be at present the principal obstacles to an
                    arrangement between the Dutch and the new kingdom of Belgium.</p>
                <p>The house of Orange-Nassau, which produced a race of distinguished heroes
                    favourable to the reformation, and amongst others our King William III. was a
                    branch, descended from Otho, a younger son of the house separated from the
                    principal one in the year 1292. There were many intermarriages between the
                    families at subsequent periods, and during the long contest in the Netherlands
                    the Prince of Orange drew great aid, both in men and money, from his relations
                    in the then countships of Nassau.</p>
                <p>The dukedom of Nassau in its present state is bounded on the north-west and on
                    the north by the Prussian Rhenish provinces; on the north-east by
                    Hesse-Darmstadt; on the east by Prussia, Hesse-Casel, and Hesse-Homburg; on the
                    south-east by the state of Francfort; and on the south and west by the Prussian
                    territory and Darmstadt. It stands wholly on the right bank of the river Rhine,
                    into which the small but navigable river Lahn falls. The surface, independently
                    of the rivers, extends over 1812 square miles. It is divided into twenty-two
                    ampts or bailiwicks. It contains ten cities, which are mostly small, but retain
                    that denomination from having been once fortified, twenty-five market-towns, and
                    429 villages, with a population in 1834 of 370,374 inhabitants of both sexes.
                    This district in 1817 contained, by the census then taken, only 301,907
                    individuals. In the year 1833 the births were, males 6690, females 6252; the
                    deaths were, males 4557, females 4506; and the marriages were 3367.</p>
                <p>The reigning house adheres to the Protestant religion; and the two sects of
                    Lutherans and Calvinists have been united into one, assuming the title of
                    Evangelical. There are 196,387 Protestants, 167,800 Catholics, 6009 Jews, and
                    184 Menonites. The Protestants of Nassau have a bishop, twenty deans, 178
                    pastors, and a theological seminary. The Catholics have a bishop and a
                    commissary, fifteen deans, and 138 parish priests, and also a seminary for
                    clerical instruction. Education is much extended and well conducted. At Weilburg
                    there is a gymnasium or college; there are also several respectable
                    grammar-schools, and 658 schools for popular instruction, under competent
                    teachers, so that every child is taught reading, writing, and the common rules
                    of arithmetic.</p>
                <p>The government is hereditary in the present family, and, if it become extinct, it
                    devolves on that branch of the Nassau family at the head of which is the king of
                    Holland. By a charter granted in the year 1817, there are two houses of
                    legislature; the upper consisting of hereditary members, of individuals of the
                    royal family, and of a few mediatized princes, being six together; the lower
                    house is elective, and consists of twenty-one members, amongst whom are the
                    Catholic and Protestant bishops, and the director of the gymnasium of Weilburg,
                    by virtue of their offices. These bodies rarely meet, and have little to do when
                    they do assemble, as few alterations are made in the laws, and new taxes are not
                    wanted.</p>
                <p>The income of the state, independently of that of the duke, from which the
                    public, civil, and ecclesiastical institutions are paid, is about L.180,000 per
                    annum; but it has a debt charged on it amounting to near L.500,000, which is
                    yearly diminished by a sinking fund. The personal income of the duke is very
                    large, arising from his estates, houses, and mineral springs; but the amount is
                    unknown, as are also the debts by which they are encumbered. The duke has a most
                    magnificent palace on the right bank of the Rhine at Biberach, another at
                    Wiesbaden, and several<pb break="no" facs="nls:193828790"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8790-0737"/> hunting seats for pursuing his favourite
                    amusement in other parts of his dominions.</p>
                <p>The military force of the dukedom consists of two regiments of infantry, one
                    battalion of artillery, a company of pioneers, and a reserve corps serving as a
                    kind of police. The contingent of Nassau to the Germanic confederation is fixed
                    at 3026 men.</p>
                <p>The face of the country may be represented as in general mountainous, though
                    there are some rich and beautiful tracts of land near the river, about Hochst.
                    There are two ranges of hills which run through the territory, viz. the
                    Westerwald and the Taunus. The latter is the most picturesque, several of its
                    points rising to 1000 feet above the level of the river; whilst some of the^
                    valleys in these hills contain the mineral springs, and the vast piles of
                    building erected near them for the accommodation of their visitants. As these
                    springs have been made familiar to the English public by the popular work
                    entitled “Bubbles of the Brunnens of Nassau,” we need here do little more than
                    merely notice them. The baths of Ems are on a beautiful stream which runs into
                    the Rhine; and on its banks are a great number of lodging-houses and hotels.
                    Langen Schwallbach, about twelve hilly miles distant, in another valley, with
                    the surrounding hills covered with woods, is pleasantly situated. It too is well
                    provided with hotels and lodging-houses. Schlangenbad consists of but two large
                    buildings, though with sufficient apartments for numerous parties. Wiesbaden is
                    the most frequented, because the water is most highly valued for its curative
                    effects, and has, besides, a greater variety of amusements than either of the
                    other baths, being in contact with the city, which is a well-built place,
                    containing more than 9000 inhabitants. One of these springs is most remarkable
                    for the profit it yields to the duke, who is the proprietor of it, as well as of
                    the others. Nieder-Selters supplies that water which is known in every part of
                    Europe by the name of Seltzer. About one million of large and two millions and a
                    half of small bottles or jugs are filled from the spring and sealed. The profit
                    is stated to be about L.5000 per annum, after clearing all expenses; though it
                    is said to have been purchased by an ancestor of the duke for a single pipe or
                    butt of wine.</p>
                <p>The agriculture of the dukedom produces sufficient corn and cattle for the
                    consumption of the inhabitants, though it is generally conducted in a slovenly
                    way. The vineyards produce sufficient wine of a moderate quality, and fruit of
                    all kinds is plentiful and excellent.</p>
