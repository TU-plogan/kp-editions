                <p><label type="entry">NAVARINO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Navarin</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Neo Castro</hi></label>, is a town of Greece, in the Morea,
                    celebrated for the excellence of the harbour on which it stands. This harbour is
                    formed in front by the narrow island Sphagia, the ancient Sphacteria, which is
                    three miles in length. The entrance, which is at the south end of the island, is
                    less than a mile broad, but the harbour opens to a width of three miles, and its
                    general depth, with the exception of two shoal spots, varies from twelve to
                    twenty-seven fathoms. This harbour is so spacious, and so well secured from the
                    sea, as to admit of the largest fleet anchoring and riding in it with perfect
                    safety.</p>
                <p>At two periods very remote from each other this harbour has been the scene of
                    remarkable naval victories. The first was during the Peloponnesian war, 425
                    before Christ, when the Athenian fleet under Demosthenes pursued the Spartans,
                    who were more powerful, and entirely destroyed their fleet within the harbour;
                    in consequence of which the Spartans sued for peace. During the revolutionary
                    war in Greece, the city was taken by the Greeks under the command of Ypsilanti
                    in 1821; but, in consequence of a mutiny of the Moreotes, who formed the
                    garrison, then commanded by Kolokotrone, it capitulated, on the 23d of March
                    1825, to Ibrahim Pasha, the son of the viceroy of Egypt, who thus secured an
                    important naval asylum, from which to accomplish the subjugation of Greece. The
                    united fleets of Turkey and Egypt were collected in the harbour, where they had
                    anchored, having escaped a meeting with a united fleet of English, French, and
                    Russian ships, who had been authorized to prevent their advancing to Greece. The
                    united fleet of the three powers entered the harbour, and some slight, possibly
                    undesigned hostilities, having occurred, a general attack was made on the
                    Turkish and Egyptian fleets. The English admiral, Codrington, had the chief
                    command, whilst under him Admiral Rigny commanded the French, and Count Heyden
                    the Russian squadron. The attack took place on the 20th of October 1827, and,
                    after some hours of fierce and bloody contention, it terminated in the
                    destruction of the Turkish and Egyptian fleet, the greater part of which was
                    either burned or sunk. This action, however it may be viewed in point of justice
                    or policy, decided the question as to the independence of Greece. The Egyptians
                    were expelled from the Morea; and the sultan, having lost his fleet, found
                    himself obliged to legitimate a revolution which he had laboured in vain to put
                    down. In fact, the battle of Navarino, described at the time as “an untoward
                    event,” proved, in its consequences, fatal to Turkey; it secured to Russia the
                    undisputed command of the Black Sea, and thus enabled her, in the campaigns of
                    1828 and 1829, to obtain those advantages which ultimately led to the
                    humiliating treaty of Adrianople.</p>
                <p>The city of Navarino stands on the south-east side of the harbour. It is
                    surrounded by a wall without any ditch, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828868"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8868-0743"/>is commanded by a fortress on a height, which is a
                    regular hexagon, defended by five towers at the external angles, but without
                    ditches, ramparts, or outworks. From the sea a frigate or two might easily
                    batter down the walls. The city once contained between 6000 and 7000
                    inhabitants; but many of them retired into Arcadia during the bombardment of the
                    Egyptians in 1825, an epidemic disease soon after augmented the depopulation,
                    and the peace has not yet fully replaced these losses.</p>
