                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">NAME</label> denotes a word by which men have agreed to
                    expresse some idea, or which serves to denote or signify a thing or a subject
                    spoken of. This the grammarians usually call a <hi rend="italic">noun,
                    nomen,</hi> though their noun is not of quite so much extent as our name. Seneca
                    <hi rend="italic">lde</hi><hi rend="italic">Beneficiis,</hi> lib. ii.) observes,
                    that there are a great number of things which have no name, and which,
                    therefore, we are forced to call by other borrowed names. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ingens est,</hi> says he, <hi rend="italic">rerum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >copia</hi><hi rend="italic">sine nomine,</hi><hi rend="italic">quas eum
                    propriis appellationibus signare</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >possumus, alienis accommodatis utimur;</hi> which may show why, in the course
                    of this work, we frequently give various senses to the same word.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Names</hi> are distinguished into <hi rend="italic"
                    >proper</hi> and <hi rend="italic">appellative. Proper</hi> names are those
                    which represent some individual thing or person, so as to distinguish it from
                    all other things of the same species; as <hi rend="italic">Socrates,</hi> which
                    represents a certain philosopher. <hi rend="italic">Appellative</hi> or general
                    names are those which signify common ideas, or which are common to several
                    individuals of the same species; as <hi rend="italic">horse, animal, man,
                    oak,</hi> and the like. Proper names are either called Christian, as being given
                    at baptism, or surnames; the first being imposed for distinction of persons,
                    answering to the Roman <hi rend="italic">praenomen</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    the second, for the distinction of families, answering to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nomen</hi> of the Romans, and the <hi rend="italic">patronymicum</hi> of the
                    Greeks.</p>
                <p>In the county of Nairn there are no manufactures properly so called. It is almost
                    exclusively agricultural.</p>
                <p>Originally every person had but one name, as amongst the Jews, Adam; amongst the
                    Egyptians, Busiris; amongst the Chaldees, Ninus; the Medes, Astyages; the
                    Greeks, Diomedes; the Romans, Romulus; the Gauls, Divitiacus; the Germans,
                    Ariovistus; the Britons, Cassibelaunus; the English, Hengist, &amp;c.; and so of
                    other nations, except the savages of Mount Atlas, whom Pliny and MarcelΓmus
                    represent as <hi rend="italic">anonymi,</hi> or nameless. The Jews gave the name
                    at the circumcision, viz. eight days after the birth; the Romans, to females on
                    the eighth day, to males on the ninth; at which time they held a feast, called
                    <hi rend="italic">nominalia.</hi> Since Christianity has obtained, most nations
                    have followed the Jews, baptizing and giving the name on the eighth day after
                    the birth; excepting our English ancestors, who, until recently, baptized and
                    gave the name on the birthday. The first imposition of names was founded on
                    different views, amongst different people; the most common was to mark the good
                    wishes of the parents, or to entitle the children to the good fortune which a
                    happy name seemed to promise. Hence Victor, Castor, Faustus, Statorius, Probus,
                    and the like. Accordingly, we find that such names, by Cicero called <hi
                    rend="italic">bona</hi><hi rend="italic">nomina,</hi> and by Tacitus, <hi
                    rend="italic">fausta nomina,</hi> were first enrolled and ranged in the Roman
                    musters, because those bearing them were first called to serve at the
                    sacrifices, in the foundation of colonies, &amp;c. And, on the contrary, Livy
                    calls Atrius Umber, <hi rend="italic">abominandi omnis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nomen</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whilst Plautus, on occasion of mentioning a
                    person named <hi rend="italic">Lyco,</hi> or greedy wolf, says,</p>
                <p>Vosmet nunc facite conjecturam caeterum Quid id sit hominis, cui Lyco nomen
                    fict.</p>
                <p>Hence Plato recommends it to men to be careful in giving happy names; and the
                    Pythagoreans taught expressly, that the minds, actions, and successes of men
                    were according to their names, genius, and fate. Thus Panormi-tan, <hi
                    rend="italic">ex bonο nomine oritur bona praesumptio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and the common proverb, <hi rend="italic">Bonum nomen bonum omen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and hence the foundation of the onomomantia. It is an
                    observation deserving attention, says the Abbé Barthélemi, that the greater part
                    of names found in Homer are marks of distinction, and appear to have been given
                    in honour of the qualities most esteemed in the heroic ages. From the word <hi
                    rend="italic">polemos,</hi> which signifies war, have been formed <hi
                    rend="italic">Elepolemus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Archepolemus,</hi> the names
                    of two heroes mentioned in the Iliad. The former name signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">able to support,</hi> and the latter, <hi rend="italic">able to
                    direct,</hi> the labours of <hi rend="italic">war.</hi> By adding to the word
                    <hi rend="italic">mache,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">battle,</hi> certain
                    prepositions and different parts of speech, which modify the sense in a manner
                    always honourable, are composed the names <hi rend="italic">Amphimachus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Antimachus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Promachus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Telemachus.</hi> Proceeding in the same way, with the word strength or
                    intrepidity, they formed the names <hi rend="italic">Agapenor,</hi> “he who
                    esteems valour,” and <hi rend="italic">Αrjenor,</hi> “he who directs it.” From
                    <hi rend="italic">thoes,</hi> swift, are derived <hi rend="italic">Alca-</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193828166" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8166-0689"/><hi rend="italic"
                    >thoes, Panthoes,</hi><hi rend="italic">Perithoes,</hi> &amp;c.; from <hi
                    rend="italic">nous,</hi> mind or intelligence, come <hi rend="italic"
                    >Astynoes,</hi><hi rend="italic">Arsinoes,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Antenoes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> from <hi rend="italic">medes,</hi>
                    counsel, <hi rend="italic">Agamedes, Eumedes, Lycomedes,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Thrasymodes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and from <hi rend="italic">clios,</hi>
                    glory, <hi rend="italic">Amphicles, Ag</hi><hi rend="italic">acies,
                    Iphicles,</hi><hi rend="italic">Patroclus, Cleobutus,</hi> and many others.
                    Hence Camden takes it for granted, that the. names, in all nations and
                    languages, are significative, and not simple sounds for mere distinction’s sake.
                    This holds not only amongst the Jews, Greeks, and Latins, but even amongst the
                    Turks, with whom Abdallah signifies <hi rend="italic">God</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">s servant,</hi> Soliman, <hi rend="italic">peaceable,</hi>
                    Mahommed, <hi rend="italic">glorified,</hi> &amp;c.; and also amongst the
                    savages of Hispaniola, and throughout America, who, in their languages, name
                    their children <hi rend="italic">Glistering Light, Sun, Bright, Fine Gold,</hi>
                    &amp;c.; whilst those of Congo call them by the names of precious stones,
                    flowers, &amp;c. To suppose names given without any meaning, however their
                    signification may be lost by the alteration of language, that learned author
                    thinks is to reproach our ancestors, and that too contrary to the sense of all
                    ancient writers. Porphyry remarks, that the barbarous <hi rend="italic"
                    >names,</hi> as he calls them, were very emphatical, and very concise; and
                    accordingly it was esteemed a duty to be <hi rend="italic">&lt;ρηοωνυμοι,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">sui</hi><hi rend="italic">nominis homines.</hi> Hence
                    Severus, Probus, and Aurelius, are called <hi rend="italic">sui nominis
                    imperatores.</hi> It was the usual way of giving names, to wish the children
                    might discharge their names. Thus, when Gunthram king of France named Clotharius
                    at the font, he said, <hi rend="italic">Crescat puer, et hujus sit
                    nominis</hi><hi rend="italic">executor.</hi> The ancient Britons, Camden says,
                    generally took their names from colours, because they painted themselves; but
                    these names are now lost, or remain hid amongst the welsh. When they were
                    subdued by the Romans, they took Roman names, some of which still remain
                    corrupted; though the greater part became extinct upon the admission of the
                    English Saxons, who introduced the German names, as <hi rend="italic">Cridda,
                    Penda, Oswald, Edward,</hi> and the like. The Danes, too, brought with them
                    their names; as <hi rend="italic">Suayne, Harold,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Knute,</hi> &amp;c. The Normans, at the Conquest, brought in other German
                    names, having originally used the German tongue; such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fobert, William, Fichard, Henry, Hugh,</hi> &amp;c. in the same manner as the
                    Greek names <hi rend="italic">Aspasius, Boethius,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Symmachus,</hi> &amp;c. were introduced into Italy upon the division of the
                    empire. After the Conquest, our nation, which had ever been averse to foreign
                    names, as deeming them unlucky, began to take Hebrew names; as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Matthew, David, Samson,</hi> &amp;c. Camden mentions it as an opinion, that the
                    practice of giving surnames for Christian names first began in the reign of
                    Edward VI. and was observed by such as would be godfathers, when they were more
                    than half fathers; upon which some were persuaded to change their names at
                    confirmation, which seems to have been usual in other countries. Thus, two sons
                    of Henry II. of France, christened <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Hercules,</hi> changed them at confirmation into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Henry</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Francis.</hi> In monasteries, the religious
                    assume new names at their admission, to show that they are about to lead a new
                    life, and have renounced the world, their family, and even their name; as, for
                    instance, sister Mary <hi rend="italic">of the Incarnation,</hi> brother Henry
                    <hi rend="italic">of the Holy Sacrament,</hi> and the like. The popes also
                    changed their names at their exaltation to the pontificate; a custom first
                    introduced by Pope Sergius, whose name till then, as Platina informs us, was <hi
                    rend="italic">Swine s Snout.</hi> But Onuphrius refers it to John XII. or XIII.
                    and at the same time adds a reason for the change different from that of
                    Platina, namely, that it was done in imitation of St Peter and St Paul, who were
                    first called <hi rend="italic">Simon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Saul.</hi></p>
                <p>Amongst the ancients, those deified by the heathen consecrations had new names
                    given them; thus, Romulus was called <hi rend="italic">Quirinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> Melicertes, <hi rend="italic">Portunus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Portumus,</hi> &amp;c. New names were also given in adoptions, and
                    sometimes by testament. Thus L. Aemilius, adopted by Scipio, took the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Scipio Africanus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Augustus,
                    who was at first called <hi rend="italic">C. Octavius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Thurinus,</hi> being adopted by the testament of Julius Caesar into his name
                    and family, took the name of <hi rend="italic">Caius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Julius Caesar Octavianus.</hi> Names were also changed at enfranchisements into
                    new cities. Thus, Lucumo, on his first being made free of Rome, took the name
                    <hi rend="italic">Lucius</hi><hi rend="italic">Tarquinius Priscus·,</hi> and
                    slaves, when made free, usually assumed the names of their masters. Those called
                    to the equestrian order, if they had base names, were always new-named, <hi
                    rend="italic">nominibus ingenuorum veterumque Romanorum.</hi> And amongst the
                    primitive Christians, it was the practice to change the names of the
                    catechumens; thus, the renegado Lucianus, till his baptism, was calledZwciwí.
                    Towards the middle of the fifteenth century, it was the fancy of the wits and
                    the learned men of the age, particularly in Italy, to change their baptismal
                    names for classical ones; as Sannazarius, for instance, who altered his own
                    plain name of <hi rend="italic">Jacopo</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Actius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Syncerus.</hi> Numbers did the same, and, amongst the rest,
                    Platina the historian at Rome, who, not without a solemn ceremonial, took the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Callimachus,</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philip.</hi> Pope Paul II. who reigned about the same time, unluckily chanced
                    to be suspicious, illiterate, and obtuse in comprehension. He had no idea that
                    persons could wish to alter their names unless they had some bad design; and
                    actually scrupled not to employ imprisonment and other violent methods to
                    discover the fancied mystery. On this frivolous pretence, Platina was most
                    cruelly tortured; but he had nothing to confess, and so the pope, after
                    endeavouring in vain to convict him of heresy, sedition, and other crimes,
                    released him after a long imprisonment.</p>
