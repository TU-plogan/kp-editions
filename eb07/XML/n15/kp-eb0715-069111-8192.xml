                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">NAPIER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, Baron of
                    Merchiston in Scotland, and the inventor of the Logarithms, was the eldest son
                    of Sir Archibald Napier of Edinbellie and Merchiston, by his first wife Janet
                    Bothwell, and was born near Edinburgh, in the year 1550. Having given early
                    indications of great natural parts, his father was careful to have them
                    cultivated by a learned education. After passing through the ordinary <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193828205" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8205-0692"/> courses of
                    liberal study at the University of St Andrews, he is said to have made the tour
                    of France, Italy, and Germany. Upon his return to his native country, his
                    literature and other accomplishments soon rendered him conspicuous, and might
                    have raised him to the highest offices of the state; but declining all civil
                    employments, and avoiding the bustle of the court, he retired from active life
                    to pursue scientific and literary researches, in which he made such uncommon
                    progress, as to favour mankind with divers useful discoveries. He applied
                    himself chiefly to the study of mathematics, and to that of the Holy Scriptures;
                    and in regard to both, he has evinced the most extensive knowledge and profound
                    penetration. His Commentaries upon the Apocalypse indicate the most acute
                    investigation, and an uncommon strength of judgment; and though time has
                    discovered that his calculations concerning particular events proceeded upon
                    fallacious data, his reasonings are not on that account the less ingenious. This
                    work was printed abroad in several languages; particularly in French at Rochelle
                    in the year 1602, in a quarto volume, announced in the title as revised by
                    himself. Nothing, it has been observed, could be more agreeable to the people of
                    Rochelle, or the Huguenots of France, at this time, than the author’s
                    annunciation of the pope as antichrist, which in this book he has endeavoured to
                    set forth with much zeal and erudition. But what has rendered his name for ever
                    illustrious was his great and fortunate discovery of the logarithms, by which
                    the science of astronomy and the arts of practical geometry and navigation have
                    been wonderfully aided and advanced. That he had begun before the year 1594 the
                    train of inquiry which led to this great achievement, appears evident from a
                    letter to Crugerus, written by Kepler in the year 1624, wherein, mentioning· the
                    <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirificus,</hi> he writes thus:
                    “Nihil autem supra Neperianam rationem esse puto; etsi Scotus quidem literis ad
                    Tychonem, anno 1594, scriptis jam spem fecit canonis illius mirifici.” This
                    allusion agrees with the idle story mentioned by Wood in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Athenae Oxoniensis,</hi> and explains it in a way perfectly consonant to the
                    rights of Napier as the inventor.</p>
                <p>When Napier had communicated to Mr Henry Briggs, mathematical professor in
                    Gresham College, his wonderful Canon for the Logarithms, that learned professor
                    set himself to apply the rules in his <hi rend="italic">Imitatio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nepierea</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in a letter to
                    Archbishop Usher, written in the year 1615, he thus expresses himself :—“Napier,
                    Baron of Merchiston, hath set my head and hands at work with his new and
                    admirable Logarithms. I hope to see him this summer, if it please God; for I
                    never saw a book which pleased me better, and made me more wonder.” The
                    following passage from the life of Lilly the astrologer gives a picturesque view
                    of the meeting between Briggs and the inventor of the logarithms, at Merchiston,
                    near Edinburgh. “I will acquaint you,” says Lilly, “with one memorable story
                    related unto me by John Marr, an excellent mathematician and geometrician, whom
                    I conceive you remember. He was servant to King James I. and Charles I. When
                    Merchiston first published his logarithms, Mr Briggs, then reader of the
                    astronomy lectures at Gresham College in London, was so much surprised with
                    admiration of them, that he could have no quietness in himself until he had seen
                    that noble person whose only invention they were. He acquaints John Marr
                    therewith, who went into Scotland before Mr Briggs, purposely to be there when
                    these two so learned persons should meet. Mr Briggs appoints a certain day when
                    to meet at Edinburgh; but failing thereof, Merchiston was fearful he would not
                    come. It happened one day as John Marr and the Baron Napier were speaking of Mr
                    Briggs; ‘ Ah, John,’ said Merchiston, ‘ Mr Briggs will not come.’ At the very
                    instant one knocks at the gate: John Marr hasted down, and it proved to be Mr
                    Briggs, to his great contentment. He brings Mr Briggs up to the baron’s chamber,
                    where almost one quarter of an hour was spent, each beholding the other with
                    admiration before one word was spoken. At last Mr Briggs began: ‘ Sir, I have
                    undertaken this long journey purposely to see your person, and to know by what
                    engine of wit or ingenuity you carne first to think of this most excellent help
                    into astronomy, viz. the Logarithms; but, Sir, being by you found out, I wonder
                    nobody else found it out before, when now being known it appears so easy.’ He
                    was nobly entertained by the illustrious baron; and every summer after that,
                    during the baron’s life, this venerable man, Mr Briggs, went purposely to
                    Scotland to visit him.”</p>
                <p>There is a passage in the Life of Tycho Brahe by Gassendi, which might lead some
                    to suppose that Napier’s method had previously been explored by Herwart at
                    Hoen-burg. This passage occurs in Gassendi’s observations on a letter from Tycho
                    to Herwart, written on the last day of August 1599. “Dixit Hervatus nihil morari
                    se solvendi cujusquam trianguli difficultatem; solere se enim multiplicationum
                    ac divisionum vice additiones solum, subtractiones 93 usurpare quod ut fieri
                    posset, docuit postmo-dum suo logarithmorum Canone Neperus.” But Herwart here
                    alludes to the work afterwards published in the year 1610, which solves
                    triangles by prostaphaeresis, a mode totally different from that of the
                    Logarithms.</p>
                <p>Kepler, who was ignorant that Napier had been deceased for more than two years,
                    addressed a letter to him, dated 28th of July 1619 (prefixed as a dedication to
                    his <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides</hi> for the year 1620), in which he expresses
                    his high admiration of the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mirificus,</hi> and his astonish- • ment and delight on first becoming
                    acquainted with the importance of Napier’s great discovery. “And, indeed,” to
                    use the words of one of his biographers, “if we consider that Napier’s discovery
                    was not, like those of Kepler or of Newton, connected with any analogies or
                    coincidences which might have led him to it, but the fruit of unassisted reason
                    and science, we shall be vindicated in placing him in one of the highest niches
                    in the temple of fame. Kepler had made many unsuccessful attempts to discover
                    his canon for the periodic motions of the planets, and hit upon it at last, as
                    he himself candidly owns, on the 15th of May 1618; and Newton applied the
                    palpable tendency of heavy bodies to the earth to the system of the universe in
                    general; but Napier sought out his admirable rules by a slow scientific
                    progress, arising from the gradual evolution of truth.” But to quote this, or
                    any other similar observations of an ordinary biographer, may here be considered
                    as worse than superfluous; for the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the History
                    of Mathematical and Physical Science,</hi> by the late Professor Playfair,
                    prefixed to this work, contains a view of the nature and value of Napier’s great
                    discovery, and the character of his genius, which at once satisfies scientific
                    curiosity, and throws into the shade all the slighter sketches of less weighty
                    authorities.</p>
                <p>The last literary exertion of this eminent person was the publication, in the
                    year 1617, of his <hi rend="italic">Pabdology and Promptuary,</hi> which he
                    dedicated to the Chancellor Seton, and soon afterwards died at Merchiston, on
                    the 4th of April of the same year, in the sixty-eighth year of his age.</p>
                <p>This renowned discoverer was twice married. By his first wife, who was a daughter
                    of Sir James Stirling of Keir, he had only one son, named Archibald. He was
                    appointed a privy counsellor by James VI., under whose reign he also held the
                    offices of treasurer-depute, justiceclerk, and senator of the college of
                    justice; and by Charles I. he was raised to the peerage. By his second wife, a
                    daughter of Sir James Chisholm of Cromlix, he had a numerous family of sons and
                    daughters.</p>

                    The biographical notice in the preceding editions of this work seems to have

                    “fifth edition” was printed at Edinburgh, 1645, 4to. It was translated into
                    French by George Thomson, and printed at Rochelle, 1602, in 4to. On the title,
                    it is said to have been revised by the author himself (“reverie par lui-même”),
                    and was reprinted in 1605, and again in 1607, in 8vo.</p>

                <p>It is not necessary to specify the English translations or other works
                    illustrative of these several publications.</p>

                    rend="italic">Bones,</hi> an instrument invented by Baron Napier, whereby the
                    Multiplication and Division of large numbers is much facilitated. Suppose the
                    common table of multiplication to be made upon a plate of metal, ivory, or
                    pasteboard, and then conceive the several columns, standing downwards from the
                    digits on the head, to be cut asunder; these are what are called <hi
                    rend="italic">Napier s rods of multiplication.</hi> But then there must be a
                    good number of each; for as many times as any figure is in the multiplicand, so
                    many rods of that species, or with that figure on the top of it, must we have,
                    though six rods of each species will be sufficient for any example in common
                    affairs. There must also be as many rods of 0’s. But before we explain the mode
                    of using these rods, there is another thing to be known, namely, that the
                    figures on every rod are written in an order different from that in the table.
                    Thus the little square space or division in which the several products of every
                    column are written is divided into two parts by a line across from the upper
                    angle on the right to the lower on the left; and if the product is a digit, it
                    is set in the lower division, but if it has two places, the first is set in the
                    lower, and the second in the upper division. The spaces on the top are not
                    divided. There is also a rod of digits not divided, which is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">index rod,</hi> and of this we require only one single rod.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Multiplication by Napier’s Rods</hi> —First lay down the index
                    rod; then on the right of it set a rod whose top is the figure in the highest
                    place of the multiplicand; next to this, again, set the rod whose top is the
                    next figure of the multiplicand, and so on in order to the first figure. Then
                    the multiplicand is tabulated for all the nine digits; for in the same line of
                    squares standing against every figure of the index rod, we have the product of
                    that figure; and therefore we have no more to do but to transfer the products,
                    and sum them. But in taking out these products from the rods, the order in which
                    the figures stand obliges us to employ a very easy and small addition. Thus,
                    begin to take out the figure in the lower part, or units’ place, of the square
                    of the first rod on the right, add the figure on the upper part of this rod to
                    that in the lower part of the next, and so on, which may be done as fast as we
                    can look on them. To make this practice as clear as possible, take the following
                    example: To multiply 4768 by 385. Having set the rods together for the number
                    4768 (fig. 2) against 5 in the index, we find this number by adding, according
                    to the rule</p>

                <p>To render the use of the rods yet more regular and easy, they are kept in a flat
                    square box, the breadth of which is that of ten rods, and the length that of one
                    rod, as thick as to contain six, or as many as may be required, the capacity of
                    the box being divided into ten cells for the different species of rods. When the
                    rods are put up in the box (each species in its own cell distinguished by the
                    first figure of the rod set before it on the face of the box near the top), as
                    much of every rod stands without the box as shows the first figure of that rod;
                    also upon one of the flat sides without, and near the edge, upon the left hand,
                    the index rod is fixed; and along the foot there is a small ledge, so that the
                    rods when applied are laid upon this side, and supported by the ledge, which
                    makes the practice very easy. But in case the multiplicand should have more than
                    nine places, the upper face of the box may be made broader. Some make the rods
                    with four different faces, and figures on each for different purposes.</p>

                    tabulate the divisor; then we have it multiplied by all the digits, out of which
                    we may choose such convenient divisors as will be next less to the figures in
                    the dividend, and write the index answering in the quotient, and so continually
                    till the work is done. Thus 2179788, divided by 6123, gives in the quotient 356.
                    Having tabulated the divisor 6123, we see that 6123 cannot be had in 2179;
                    therefore take five places, and on the rods find a number that is equal or next
                    less to 21797, which is 18369; that is, three times the divisor. Wherefore set 3
                    in the quotient, and subtract 18369 from the figures above, and there will
                    remain 3428; to which add 8, the next figure of the dividend, and seek again on
                    the rods for it, or the next less, which will be found to be five times;
                    therefore set five in the quotient, and subtract 30615 from 34288, and there
                    will remain 3673, to which add 8, the last figure in the dividend, and finding
                    it to be just six times the divisor, set six in the quotient. Thus,</p>
                <p>6123)2179788(356.</p>
